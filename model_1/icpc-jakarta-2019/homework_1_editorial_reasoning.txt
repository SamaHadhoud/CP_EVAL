We are given an integer N and a permutation A of [1, N]. We need to output any permutation B such that the sum of absolute differences (|A_i - B_i| for all i) is at least N.

However, note that the problem states that we do not necessarily have to output the permutation that maximizes the difference (B_max), but any permutation B for which diff(A, B) >= N.

It is known that for any permutation A of size N (with N>=2), the maximum possible difference (B_max) will be at least N, so we are guaranteed that such a permutation exists.

But how can we construct one?

First, note that the trivial approach of reversing the array (i.e., setting B_i = A_{N+1-i}) might work? Let's check with the sample:

Sample Input #1: A = [1, 3, 2, 4]
Reversing: B = [4, 2, 3, 1] -> which is the sample output and gives 8.

But is reversing always sufficient? Consider the next sample: 
Sample Input #2: A = [2,1] -> reversing gives [1,2] and the difference is |2-1| + |1-2| = 1+1 = 2, which is >=2 -> valid.

But note: what if we have an odd number of elements? Let's test with N=3.

Example: A = [1,2,3]
Reverse: B = [3,2,1]
diff = |1-3| + |2-2| + |3-1| = 2+0+2 = 4 >= 3 -> valid.

However, we can note that the maximum difference permutation for N=3 might be even larger? But the problem doesn't require the maximum, just at least N.

But wait: what if the array is symmetric? For example, if the array is already a palindrome? 
Example: A = [1,2,1] -> but wait, it's a permutation so distinct? So we cannot have duplicates.

So the array is a permutation of distinct integers.

However, note that reversing the array might sometimes work, but we must be cautious: the problem does not require maximum, so we can also use simpler methods.

But note: the problem says that any permutation B with diff(A,B)>=N is acceptable.

Another idea: what if we shift the array? For example, we can shift the array by one? 
But shifting by one might not yield a permutation? Actually, if we do a cyclic shift, then we get a permutation.

But let's test: 
For A = [1,2,3,4] 
If we do a cyclic shift to the left: B = [2,3,4,1]
diff = |1-2|+|2-3|+|3-4|+|4-1| = 1+1+1+3 = 6 >=4 -> valid.

But what if we do a cyclic shift to the right? B = [4,1,2,3]
diff = |1-4|+|2-1|+|3-2|+|4-3| = 3+1+1+1 = 6.

But what if we have a different arrangement? 

Actually, the problem is very lenient: we only require the difference to be at least N. The minimum possible maximum? Actually, we know that the minimum difference we require is N.

What is the minimum possible diff(A,B) over all permutations? It's 0? But wait, if B=A then diff=0. But we are required to have at least N.

So we need to avoid being too close to A.

We can also consider swapping adjacent elements? But then the difference for two adjacent positions: |a_i - a_{i+1}| + |a_{i+1} - a_i}| = 2|a_i - a_{i+1}|. But the rest of the positions are the same. So the total difference is 2|a_i - a_{i+1}|. 

We require 2|a_i - a_{i+1}| >= N? That might not be true if the adjacent elements are consecutive. For example, if we have [1,2,3,...,N] and we swap two adjacent ones: then the difference is 2. For N>=3, 2 might be less than N.

So we need a more systematic approach.

Alternatively, we can use the following idea:

We know that the maximum possible difference is achieved when we pair the smallest element of A with the largest of B, the second smallest with the second largest, etc. But note: we are free to assign any permutation. The maximum is achieved by having B as the reversed sorted version of A? Actually, if we sort A, then set B as the reverse of the sorted A, that maximizes the difference? 

But note: the problem does not require the maximum. We only need at least N.

But also note: we are not required to sort A. We are to output a permutation of [1,N] that is distinct.

However, we can use the following:

1. The trivial reversal: B_i = A_{N-1-i} (0-indexed) -> this gives a permutation and the difference is the same as the sample.

But is reversal always at least N? 

We can prove that for any permutation A, the reversal B (i.e., B_i = A_{N-1-i}) has:
   diff(A, B) = sum_{i=0}^{N-1} |A_i - A_{N-1-i}|.

But note that each pair (i, N-1-i) is considered twice? Actually, each element appears in one pair? Actually, if N is even, we have N/2 pairs. Each pair (x,y) contributes |x-y| twice? Actually, no: in the reversal, the entire array is reversed. 

But let's split the array:

For i from 0 to N-1, the element at i is A_i and at the same index in the reversed array is A_{N-1-i}. So the absolute difference for index i is |A_i - A_{N-1-i}|.

But note: the same pair (i and N-1-i) is counted twice: at index i and at index N-1-i? Actually, when i runs from 0 to N-1, we are covering every index once. However, when we do the reversal, the element at index i becomes A_{N-1-i}. So the absolute difference at index i is |A_i - A_{N-1-i}|. Then at index j = N-1-i, the absolute difference is |A_j - A_i| = |A_i - A_j|. So each unordered pair {i, j} (with j = N-1-i) is used at two indices? Actually, no: because when i and j are distinct, they are two different indices. But if N is even, then i != j for all pairs. If N is odd, the middle element is compared with itself? Actually, when N is odd, the middle index is i = j, so the difference at the middle is |A_mid - A_mid| = 0.

Therefore, the total difference is:
  For even N: sum_{i=0}^{N/2-1} [ |A_i - A_{N-1-i}| + |A_{N-1-i} - A_i| ] = 2 * sum_{i=0}^{N/2-1} |A_i - A_{N-1-i}| 
  But wait, actually at index i we have |A_i - A_{N-1-i}| and at index N-1-i we have |A_{N-1-i} - A_i| = same. So indeed each pair is counted twice? Actually, no: because the index i and the index N-1-i are two distinct indices. So the total sum is the sum over all indices: which is the same as the sum over the pairs? 

Actually, we can write:
  diff(A, reversed_A) = 
      for i from 0 to N-1: |A_i - A_{N-1-i}|

But note: if we consider the entire array, we are adding for each index i. For the pair (i, N-1-i), we get the same term at i and at N-1-i? Actually, no: at index i we get |A_i - A_{N-1-i}|, and at index N-1-i we get |A_{N-1-i} - A_i| = |A_i - A_{N-1-i}|. So actually each absolute difference is added twice.

Therefore, the total sum is 2 * sum_{i=0}^{floor((N-1)/2)} |A_i - A_{N-1-i}|.

But note: if N is even, we have N/2 pairs, and each pair contributes 2 * |A_i - A_{N-1-i}|? Actually, no: because we have two indices per pair, each index gives |A_i - A_{N-1-i}|, so the entire pair gives 2 * |A_i - A_{N-1-i}|. 

So the total difference is 2 * (the sum of absolute differences of the pairs).

Now, is this at least N? 

We can note that the reversal might not always be at least N? Actually, let me test with the worst-case: when the array is symmetric? But the array is a permutation. 

Example: N=4, A = [1,2,3,4] -> reversed is [4,3,2,1]. 
Then the differences: 
  |1-4| = 3, |2-3|=1, |3-2|=1, |4-1|=3 -> total 3+1+1+3=8 >=4.

But what if A is symmetric? For even N: 
  A = [1,2,2,1] -> but wait, distinct? So no.

So the array has distinct elements.

But consider: A = [1, 3, 4, 2] -> then reversed is [2,4,3,1]. 
Differences: 
  |1-2|=1, |3-4|=1, |4-3|=1, |2-1|=1 -> total=4, which is >=4. 

Another worst-case: can we get exactly N? 

We need to have the total difference at least N. Since the reversal gives 2 * (sum of the absolute differences of the pairs), and each pair must be at least 1? Actually, no: if two numbers are consecutive? But even then, the absolute difference is at least 1. 

How many pairs? For even N: N/2 pairs, each pair gives at least 1? Then the total for the pairs is at least N/2, and then multiplied by 2 gives at least N. 

But wait: the reversal gives 2 * (sum of |A_i - A_{N-1-i}| for i=0 to N/2-1). Since each |A_i - A_{N-1-i}| is at least 1? Not necessarily: if the two numbers are consecutive? Then the absolute difference is 1. But then the entire reversal gives 2 * (at least the number of pairs) = 2 * (N/2) = N. 

So for even N, we get at least N.

For odd N: the middle element is fixed and gives 0. The pairs are (N-1)/2 pairs. Each pair contributes 2 * |A_i - A_{N-1-i}|. So the total difference is 2 * (sum of absolute differences of the pairs). Since there are (N-1)/2 pairs, and each absolute difference is at least 1, then the total is at least 2 * ( (N-1)/2 ) = N-1. 

But we require at least N. 

So for odd N, reversal might not be enough? 

Example: N=3, A=[1,2,3] -> reversal gives [3,2,1]: 
  |1-3|=2, |2-2|=0, |3-1|=2 -> total=4 >=3 -> valid.

But what if the array is [1, 3, 2]? Then reversal: [2,3,1]:
  |1-2|=1, |3-3|=0, |2-1|=1 -> total=2, which is less than 3 -> not valid.

So reversal for the array [1,3,2] fails? 

But wait: we have to reverse the entire array: 
  Original array: [1,3,2] -> reversed: [2,3,1] -> then the differences: 
    index0: |1-2|=1
    index1: |3-3|=0
    index2: |2-1|=1
    total=2.

But 2 < 3 -> not acceptable.

So reversal is not always sufficient for odd N.

Therefore, we need a different method.

But note: the problem does not require the reversal. We can output any permutation as long as the total difference is at least N.

How about we try to maximize the difference? 

The known maximum is achieved by pairing the smallest element with the largest, the second smallest with the second largest, etc. However, we cannot sort A arbitrarily because the indices matter: the difference is per index.

But we can rearrange the entire array arbitrarily? Actually, we are to assign a permutation B arbitrarily. So we can assign the values arbitrarily to indices.

But note: the problem says "permutation of N integers", meaning that we assign to each index i a distinct number from 1 to N.

The maximum total difference is achieved by having the sequence of B as the reversed sorted version of A? Actually, no: because we are constrained by the positions. 

Alternatively, we can consider: 
  Let A_sorted = sorted(A)
  Then one known strategy for maximum sum of absolute differences is to pair the smallest with the largest, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on. But then how do we assign these pairs to indices? Actually, we are free to assign the values arbitrarily to indices. So we can assign the largest value to the index that originally had the smallest? 

But note: the problem does not require the maximum. We only need at least N.

Alternatively, we can do:

  We know that the maximum possible difference is bounded by: 
    For a fixed set of numbers, the maximum sum of absolute differences is achieved by pairing the smallest available with the largest available, then the next smallest with the next largest, etc. (this is a classic problem).

But we are not forced to assign the same set? Actually, the set of numbers for A and for B are both {1,2,...,N}. So the set is fixed. Therefore, the maximum possible diff(A,B) is achieved by the following:

  Sort the array A to get a sorted array: a1 <= a2 <= ... <= aN.
  Then set B for the indices as follows: 
      For the index that originally had the smallest value a1, assign the largest value aN.
      For the index that originally had a2, assign a_{N-1}.
      ... 
      For the index that originally had a_i, assign a_{N+1-i}.

But wait, actually we are free to assign any permutation to B. So we can assign the values arbitrarily. Therefore, the maximum total absolute difference we can get is:

  Let S = sorted(A) = [s1, s2, ..., sN] (in increasing order).
  Then the maximum total is: 
        (sN - s1) + (s_{N-1} - s2) + ... 
        = (sN + s_{N-1} + ... + s_{ceil(N/2)+1}) - (s1 + s2 + ... + s_{floor(N/2)})

But note: we are not constrained by the indices of A? Actually, we are: the absolute difference is computed per index. But we can assign the value of B arbitrarily to each index. So we can assign the largest value in B to the index that has the smallest in A, the second largest to the index that has the second smallest in A, etc. 

Therefore, the maximum total difference is indeed the one above.

But note: the problem does not require the maximum. So we can also use a simpler construction.

However, we must be cautious: our construction must run in O(N) because N can be up to 100000.

But we can do:

  We know that the reversal method works for even N (as we proved: at least N). For odd N, reversal might yield as low as N-1 (as we saw in the example: [1,3,2] -> 2). 

So we need to adjust for odd N.

Alternative idea: 

We can do a cyclic shift. For example, shift by k. But which k? 

Consider: 
  Let B_i = A_{(i+k) mod N}   (cyclic shift to the left by k). 

But then the absolute difference at index i is |A_i - A_{(i+k) mod N}|. 

The total difference: sum_i |A_i - A_{(i+k) mod N}|.

We need this to be at least N.

But if k=1, then the differences are |A_i - A_{i+1}| for i from 0 to N-2 and |A_{N-1} - A_0|. 

The total is the sum of consecutive differences. But this might be as low as N-1? For example, if the array is sorted: [1,2,...,N]. Then each consecutive difference is 1, and there are N terms? Actually, no: the consecutive differences are for adjacent pairs: and we have N pairs? Actually, we have N terms: from index0 to index N-1, each adjacent pair? Actually, no: the cyclic shift: 
  B_0 = A_1, B_1 = A_2, ... , B_{N-2}=A_{N-1}, B_{N-1}=A_0.
Then the differences:
  |A0 - A1| + |A1 - A2| + ... + |A_{N-1} - A0|

But the sum of consecutive differences in a circle: for the sorted array [1,2,...,N]:
  |1-2| + |2-3| + ... + |N-1 - N| + |N-1| = 1+1+...+1 + (N-1) = (N-1) + (N-1) = 2*(N-1)? 
Wait, no: the last term is |N - 1| = N-1. So the total is (N-1)*1 (for the first N-1 terms) plus |N-1| = N-1 -> total = (N-1) + (N-1) = 2N-2, which is >=N for N>=2.

But what if the array is not sorted? 

Example: A = [1,3,2] (N=3). 
  Cyclic shift to the left by 1: B = [3,2,1]
  Differences: 
      |1-3|=2, |3-2|=1, |2-1|=1 -> total=4 >=3 -> valid.

But what if we shift by 1: 
  A = [2,1,3] -> B = [1,3,2]
  Differences: |2-1|=1, |1-3|=2, |3-2|=1 -> total=4.

So cyclic shift by 1 always gives at least 2N-2? Then for N>=2, 2N-2 >= N? For N>=2, yes: because 2*2-2=2>=2, and for N>=3, 2N-2 >= N (since N-2>=0? actually for N=3: 2*3-2=4>=3). 

But wait: what if the array is [1,2,3,...,N]? we saw 2N-2.

But is 2N-2 always the minimum for cyclic shift by 1? Actually, the consecutive differences might be more than 1? Then the total would be larger.

Therefore, cyclic shift by 1 always gives at least 2N-2, which is at least N for all N>=2.

But note: we must avoid using the same element twice? The cyclic shift produces a permutation? Yes, because it is a cyclic permutation.

So we can do:

  For any N (even or odd), we can do a cyclic shift by 1 to the left? 

But what if we do a cyclic shift by 1 to the right? That is equivalent to a cyclic shift by N-1 to the left. 

But the same reasoning applies.

So algorithm:

  Read N and the array A (0-indexed).
  Create B: 
        B[0] = A[1]
        B[1] = A[2]
        ...
        B[N-2] = A[N-1]
        B[N-1] = A[0]

But is that always valid? 

But what if we have N=2? 
  A = [2,1] -> 
      B[0]=A[1]=1, B[1]=A[0]=2 -> then B=[1,2]
      diff = |2-1| + |1-2| = 1+1 = 2 >=2 -> valid.

For N=3: 
  A=[1,2,3] -> B = [2,3,1]
      diff = |1-2| + |2-3| + |3-1| = 1+1+2 = 4>=3 -> valid.

But what about the sample: 
  Sample Input #1: A=[1,3,2,4] -> 
      B = [3,2,4,1] 
      diff = |1-3|+|3-2|+|2-4|+|4-1| = 2+1+2+3 = 8? 
      Actually, 2+1+2+3=8, which is the same as the reversal? 

But the sample output was [4,2,3,1] which also gives 8.

So cyclic shift by 1 to the left is acceptable.

But wait: the problem sample input [1,3,2,4] with cyclic shift by 1 to the left gives [3,2,4,1] -> which is different from the sample output [4,2,3,1]. But both are valid.

However, note: we must be cautious: the problem does not require any particular permutation, only one that satisfies the condition.

But what if the teacher is lenient: we can output any permutation B with diff(A,B)>=N.

But cyclic shift by 1 to the left is a permutation and we have shown that for the sorted array it gives 2N-2, which is at least N. However, we must check for arbitrary A: 

The total difference for cyclic shift by 1: 
   diff = |A0 - A1| + |A1 - A2| + ... + |A_{N-2} - A_{N-1}| + |A_{N-1} - A0|

Is this at least N? 

We know that by the triangle inequality? Actually, we cannot use the triangle inequality to bound the sum from below? 

But note: we have a cycle. The terms are not independent.

However, we can note that the entire cycle must have at least two "jumps" of size at least 1? Actually, every term is nonnegative, but we need a lower bound.

But we know that the set of numbers is fixed: {1,2,...,N}. The differences |A_i - A_j| are at least 1 if the numbers are distinct and adjacent in the cycle? But the entire cycle must cover the entire set. 

Actually, we can use the following: 

  The total cyclic shift difference is the same as the total variation in one complete cycle. 

But we can also consider: 
  The minimum possible value of the cyclic shift difference? 

For example, if the array is sorted: then we get 2*(N-1) as above.

What if the array is in decreasing order? 
  A = [N, N-1, ..., 1] 
  Then the consecutive differences: |N - (N-1)| = 1, |N-1 - (N-2)|=1, ... , |1 - N| = N-1 -> total = (N-1)*1 + (N-1) = 2*(N-1).

But what if we have a random permutation? 

Actually, the cyclic shift difference might be smaller? 

Example: 
  Let A = [1, 3, 2, 4] -> we computed 8? Actually, 8 is more than 2*(4-1)=6.

But we need a lower bound: at least N.

Is it possible that the cyclic shift difference is less than N? 

Consider: 
  We have a cycle: the array A[0], A[1], ... , A[N-1], then back to A[0]. 
  The total cyclic shift difference is the sum of the absolute differences along the cycle.

But note: the entire cycle must cover the entire set of integers from 1 to N. The minimal cycle? 

Actually, the minimal cycle for the set {1,2,...,N} is the one that goes in increasing then decreasing? 

But we can use the fact: 
  The graph of the cycle must connect all the numbers. The minimal spanning tree for the complete graph of these numbers? 

Alternatively, we know that the minimal cycle that covers all integers in a set of distinct integers? 

But note: the cycle is fixed: we are going from A0 to A1 to ... to A_{N-1} and then back to A0. 

But we can use: 
  The sum of the absolute differences in the cycle is at least twice the difference between the maximum and the minimum? 

But actually, the entire cycle must cover the entire range. The range is [1, N], so the total variation must be at least 2*(N-1) (if we go from 1 to N and then back to 1? but we don't necessarily go back). 

But wait: we are going in a fixed cyclic order. 

Actually, we can use: 
  The cycle must at least traverse from the minimum element to the maximum element and back? 

But the minimal cycle that covers all points is at least 2*(max - min) = 2*(N-1). 

But note: we are not required to traverse the entire set in order. However, the entire set of numbers must be connected. 

But the known fact: for any cycle that contains all the points (in the real line) the length of the cycle is at least twice the distance between the maximum and the minimum. 

Why? Because we must go from min to max and then back to min? Actually, no: the cycle can start anywhere. But to cover the entire set, we must go from min to max and then we must come back to the starting point? But if the starting point is not min or max, then we have to go from min to max and then back to the start? 

Actually, the minimal cycle that covers all points in a line is achieved by going from min to max and then back to min? Then the length is 2*(max-min). 

But our cycle is fixed: we are going in the order of the indices: 
  0->1->2->...->N-1->0.

But the points are in arbitrary order. 

So the total variation is: 
   |A0-A1| + |A1-A2| + ... + |A_{N-1}-A0|

This is the perimeter of a polygon that visits the points A0, A1, ... in order and then back to A0? 

But the minimal possible value of the perimeter for a fixed set of points on a line? 

Actually, the points are on a line (the real line, with the natural order). 

The minimal cycle that covers a set of points on a line is achieved when we traverse from one end to the other and then come back? But our cycle is constrained by the indices: we must go from A0 to A1 to ... to A_{N-1} and then back to A0. 

This might be larger than 2*(max-min). 

But we know that max-min = N-1. 

And 2*(max-min) = 2*(N-1). 

But we have: 
   |A0-A1| + |A1-A2| + ... + |A_{N-1}-A0| >= 2*(max-min) = 2*(N-1) 
by the triangle inequality? Actually, no: the triangle inequality gives an upper bound? 

But we can use the following lemma: 
   For any sequence of numbers x0, x1, ... , x_{k-1} (with x_k = x0) on the real line, the total cycle length is at least 2*(max-min). 

Proof: 
   Let M = max, m = min. 
   Consider the two arcs from m to M: the cycle must go from m to M and then from M back to m. 
   But the cycle is connected: so the total upward movement must be at least (M-m) and the total downward movement must be at least (M-m). 
   Therefore, the total absolute movement is at least 2*(M-m).

But note: the absolute value differences are the total movement? 

Yes: because |x_{i}-x_{i+1}| is the movement from x_i to x_{i+1}. 

So the entire cycle must have total upward movement at least M-m and total downward movement at least M-m? Actually, the net movement is zero, but the total upward movement must be at least M-m and the total downward movement must be at least M-m. Therefore, the total absolute movement is at least 2*(M-m).

Therefore, 
   diff = |A0-A1| + ... + |A_{N-1}-A0| >= 2*(max-min) = 2*(N-1).

And since 2*(N-1) >= N for all N>=2? 
   For N=2: 2*(1)=2>=2 -> true.
   For N>=3: 2*(N-1) = 2N-2 = (N) + (N-2) >= N -> true.

Therefore, the cyclic shift by 1 (to the left) always yields a permutation B such that 
   diff(A, B) = |A0 - A1| + |A1 - A2| + ... + |A_{N-2} - A_{N-1}| + |A_{N-1} - A0| >= 2*(N-1) >= N.

So we can use the cyclic shift by 1 to the left.

But note: the problem does not require the maximum, so we are satisfied.

However, the problem states: 
  "Of course, you can still return B_max if you want, since it can be proven that diff(A, B_max) >= N for any permutation A and N>1."

But we are using a cyclic shift, which is simpler.

Implementation:

  We read N and the array A of N integers.

  Then we form an array B of the same size, where:
        B[i] = A[(i+1) % N]   for all i from 0 to N-1.

But note: 
      i=0: B[0]=A[1]
      i=1: B[1]=A[2]
      ...
      i=N-2: B[N-2]=A[N-1]
      i=N-1: B[N-1]=A[0]

Then output B.

But wait: what if the problem sample input? 
  Input: [1,3,2,4] -> 
      B[0]=A[1]=3
      B[1]=A[2]=2
      B[2]=A[3]=4
      B[3]=A[0]=1
      -> [3,2,4,1]

But the sample output was [4,2,3,1]. Both are valid.

But the problem says: "If there is more than one valid solution, you can output any of them."

So we can output [3,2,4,1].

But the sample input #2: 
  Input: [2,1] -> 
      B[0]=A[1]=1
      B[1]=A[0]=2
      -> [1,2]

But the sample output was [1,2] (which is the same).

Therefore, we can use this method.

But note: we must be cautious about performance. 
  We are doing a single pass: O(N).

Let me test with a small example: N=3, A=[1,2,3] -> B = [2,3,1] -> which we know is valid.

But what about the odd N that failed in reversal: [1,3,2]? 
  A = [1,3,2] -> 
      B = [3,2,1] -> 
      diff = |1-3| + |3-2| + |2-1| = 2+1+1=4>=3 -> valid.

So it works.

Conclusion:

  We can output the cyclic shift of A to the left by one: 
      B_i = A_{(i+1) mod N} for i in [0, N-1].

This is a permutation and the total difference is at least 2*(N-1) which is >=N for N>=2.

Therefore, we can implement:

  Steps:
    1. Read N.
    2. Read the list A of N integers.
    3. Create an array B of length N.
    4. For i in range(0, N-1):
            B[i] = A[i+1]
        B[N-1] = A[0]
    5. Print the array B.

But note: the problem expects integers separated by space.

However, note: the problem does not require the maximum, so this simple solution is acceptable.

But what if we want to output the maximum? The problem says we can output any permutation with diff>=N. So we are free.

But the cyclic shift is simpler and runs in O(N).

Therefore, we'll use the cyclic shift.

But wait: the problem statement says "Darto wants to copy Danang’s homework, but Danang asks Darto to change it up a bit". The cyclic shift is very similar? But the problem doesn't care about similarity, only the mathematical condition.

So we output the cyclic shift.

But note: the problem sample output for N=4 is [4,2,3,1] which is not a cyclic shift? But we are allowed to output any valid permutation.

Therefore, we can output the cyclic shift.

Let me code the idea in pseudocode:

  n = read_int()
  A = read_list_of_integers(size=n)

  B = array of size n
  for i from 0 to n-2:
        B[i] = A[i+1]
  B[n-1] = A[0]

  print B

But we can do without an extra array? We can do:

  We can print A[1], A[2], ... , A[n-1], A[0]

But note: the array A is 0-indexed.

In code:

  for i from 1 to n-1: 
        print A[i]
  print A[0]

But without storing an array? Or we can simply:

  print " ".join(str(x) for x in A[1:] + [A[0]])

But if we are using Python, we must be cautious: slicing A[1:] creates a new list of size n-1 and then we append A[0] -> so we create a new list of size n. 

Since n can be 100000, this is acceptable in Python? The problem time limit is 1 second, and creating a list of 100000 is O(n) and acceptable.

But in other languages, we can avoid extra space? Actually, we can print the elements from index1 to the end and then the first element.

But we'll do:

  Read N and the list A.
  Print the elements from index1 to the last, then the first element.

Example: 
  Input: "4" and then "1 3 2 4"
  Then we output: "3 2 4 1"

But the problem sample output is "4 2 3 1", but we output "3 2 4 1". Both are valid.

Therefore, we have a solution.

But wait: the problem statement says that the teacher is lenient: any permutation B such that diff(A,B)>=N is acceptable. And we have proven that for the cyclic shift, the diff is at least 2*(N-1) which is >=N.

Therefore, we can output the cyclic shift.

But note: the problem says "any permutation of N integers B". The cyclic shift is a permutation.

So we are done.

However, what if we have N=1? The problem states N>=2.

Therefore, we can proceed.

Let me write the solution:

  n = int(input().strip())
  A = list(map(int, input().split()))

  if n == 1:
        # but n>=2, so skip
        print(A[0])
  else:
        # Form B: shift left by one
        # Output: A[1], A[2], ... , A[n-1], A[0]
        B = A[1:]   # This is from index1 to the end
        B.append(A[0])
        # Then print B as space separated

        # Or: 
        #   print(" ".join(map(str, A[1:] + [A[0]])))
        print(" ".join(map(str, B)))

But note: we can also do without creating a new list? 

  We can do:
        print(" ".join(map(str, A[1:])), end=" ")
        print(A[0])

But if we are in Python, we can do:

        print(*(A[1:] + [A[0]]))

This is acceptable.

But we are not required to write code? The editorial is about the idea.

But for completeness, we describe the algorithm.

Summary of the editorial:

  We are to output any permutation B of [1, N] such that the sum of |A_i - B_i| for i from 0 to N-1 is at least N.

  We propose a solution: 
        Let B_i = A_{(i+1) mod N}   (i.e., a cyclic shift to the left by one).

  Why is this valid?
        The permutation B is the same as the array A but each element is shifted to the left by one, with the first element moved to the end.
        The total difference is the sum of |A_i - A_{(i+1) mod N}| for i from 0 to N-1.
        We have shown that this sum is at least 2*(N-1) (because the set of numbers is the entire range [1, N], and the cycle must cover the entire range, so the total variation is at least twice the distance from the minimum to the maximum, which is 2*(N-1)).
        And 2*(N-1) >= N for all N>=2.

  Therefore, the cyclic shift to the left by one is a valid solution.

  The algorithm runs in O(N) time and uses O(N) memory, which is efficient for the constraints (N up to 100000).

  We also note that there are many valid solutions, and the cyclic shift is one of them.

  Example: 
        Input: [1,3,2,4] -> Output: [3,2,4,1] (cyclic shift left by one) 
        The difference: |1-3|+|3-2|+|2-4|+|4-1| = 2+1+2+3 = 8 >=4.

  Therefore, we output the cyclic shift.

But note: the problem sample input #2: 
        Input: [2,1] -> Output: [1,2] (cyclic shift left by one: the array becomes [1,2])
        The difference: |2-1|+|1-2| = 1+1=2>=2.

So we are done.

However, we can also consider: what if we do a cyclic shift to the right? 

  B_i = A_{(i-1) mod N}   (with modulo: for i=0, we use A_{N-1})

  Then the total difference is the same: 
        |A0 - A_{N-1}| + |A1 - A0}| + |A2 - A1}| + ... + |A_{N-1} - A_{N-2}}| 
        = |A_{N-1} - A0| + |A0 - A1}| + ... + |A_{N-2} - A_{N-1}| 
        which is the same as the left shift? Actually, the terms are the same but in reverse order? 

  So the total is the same.

But we can choose either. The left shift is natural.

Therefore, the solution is to output the cyclic shift (left or right) of the given array by one.

We choose the left shift.

But note: the problem sample output for the first sample is [4,2,3,1] which is not a cyclic shift? It is the reversal. But we are free to choose any valid permutation.

So we have an alternative: reversal for even N and cyclic shift for odd? But we found that cyclic shift works for all N>=2.

Therefore, we stick to the cyclic shift.

Final algorithm:

  Read N and the list A.
  Output: 
        A[1], A[2], ..., A[N-1], A[0]

This is the cyclic shift left by one.

We have proven that this permutation satisfies the condition.

Therefore, we can implement accordingly.

But note: if we want to avoid creating a new list? We can simply output the elements:

  For i from 1 to N-1: output A[i] and a space
  Then output A[0]

In Python:

  print(" ".join(map(str, A[1:] + [A[0]])))

But note: we are creating a new list of size N. This is acceptable because N<=100000.

But in C++ we can do:

  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;

  int main() {
      int n;
      cin >> n;
      int *A = new int[n];
      for (int i=0; i<n; i++) cin >> A[i];
      for (int i=1; i<n; i++) 
          cout << A[i] << " ";
      cout << A[0] << endl;
      delete[] A;
  }

This is efficient.

Therefore, the solution is straightforward.

But note: the problem says "permutation", and we are outputting distinct integers? Yes, because A is a permutation and we are just shifting.

So we are done.

However, let me test with the provided examples:

  Example 1: 
      Input: 4, [1,3,2,4] -> output [3,2,4,1] -> which is a permutation? Yes: {3,2,4,1} -> distinct.

  Example 2:
      Input: 2, [2,1] -> output [1,2] -> distinct.

So it's valid.

We have a solution.

But note: the problem says "any permutation" with diff>=N. We have provided one.

Therefore, we output the cyclic shift.

Editorial summary:

  The problem requires us to output any permutation B of the integers 1 to N such that the sum of absolute differences between A (the given permutation) and B is at least N.

  We propose a solution: 
        B is the cyclic shift to the left by one of A.

  Why is the condition satisfied?
        The sum of absolute differences for the cyclic shift is the same as the sum of the absolute differences of consecutive elements in the array (including the wrap-around from last to first). 
        Since the array A is a permutation of distinct integers from 1 to N, the entire cycle must cover the entire range. The total variation of the cycle (the sum of absolute differences) must be at least twice the difference between the maximum and minimum element, which is 2*(N-1). 
        For N>=2, we have 2*(N-1) >= N.

  Therefore, the cyclic shift is a valid solution.

  Implementation: 
        Read N and the array A of size N.
        Output the array A starting from the second element to the last, and then output the first element.

  This solution runs in O(N) time and O(N) memory, which is efficient for the constraints.

  Note: there are other valid solutions (like the reversal of A), but we have chosen the cyclic shift for its simplicity and uniform treatment of even and odd N.
