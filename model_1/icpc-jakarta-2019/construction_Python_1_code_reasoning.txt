We are given: 
  n, k: number of cities and workers.
  For each city i (1 to n): A_i, M_i, and M_i integers for B_i.
  Then k integers for the workers' materials.

Steps:
1. The graph of proposed roads is connected and has n edges (one per node) and n nodes -> one cycle.
   We need to identify the non-cycle edges (which are bridges) and the cycle edges.

2. We note that the entire graph has n edges. We need at least n-1 edges to form a spanning tree. 
   However, we have k workers. If k < n-1, it's impossible.

3. We break the graph into non-cycle edges and cycle edges by:
   - Building an undirected graph.
   - Using a BFS leaf removal to remove leaves (degree 1) and mark the edges as non-cycle. The remaining cycle is the core.

4. We have two sets of edges: non_cycle_edges and cycle_edges.

5. For each edge (represented by (min(u, v), max(u, v))), we know the materials that are allowed (from the city that proposed it: 
   for edge (i, A_i), the materials are given in B_i). Note: the same edge is proposed by two cities? 
   But the problem says: "city i proposes a road connecting city i and A_i". 
   And note: it's guaranteed that no two cities like to connect with each other (so no pair (i,j) with A_i=j and A_j=i). 
   Therefore, each edge is proposed exactly once? Actually, if city i proposes (i, A_i), then the edge (i, A_i) is only proposed by city i? 
   But the road is bidirectional, so we have to store it once. 

   However, note: if city i proposes (i, A_i) and city j (with j = A_i) might have a proposal to some other city. 
   So we have one proposal per edge? Actually, each city proposes one road. So the entire set of roads is the set of n edges.

   Therefore, for an edge (u, v) where u < v, we can get the materials from the city that proposed it? 
   But note: the input gives for city i: A_i, M_i, and then the list. 
   So for the edge (i, A_i), we know the materials from city i's proposal.

   We'll represent each edge by (min(i, A_i), max(i, A_i)), and the materials for that edge are the list given by city i.

6. We need to assign workers to edges. Each worker has a material. A worker can be assigned to an edge if the worker's material is in the edge's material list.

7. We have two types of edges: non-cycle (which must be built to avoid disconnecting the graph) and cycle (which we can skip one of them to form a spanning tree).

   Steps:
   - We must assign all non-cycle edges. If we cannot assign a worker for any non-cycle edge, output -1.
   - Then, for the cycle edges, we must assign at least L-1 of them (where L is the number of cycle edges) to have a connected graph. 
     However, note: if we assign all cycle edges, then we have n edges. But we can also form a spanning tree by skipping one cycle edge.

   Actually, we have two possible solutions:
     Option A: Build a spanning tree (n-1 edges) that includes all non-cycle edges and L-1 cycle edges.
     Option B: Build the entire graph (n edges) if we have enough workers and we can assign all edges.

   However, the problem does not require building all roads. It requires that the graph is connected. So we can skip one edge arbitrarily?

   But note: we have k workers. We must assign each worker to at most one road. We are allowed to leave workers idle (output 0 0).

   Constraints:
     - We must have at least n-1 roads built (so at least n-1 workers must be assigned to roads that form a spanning tree).

   How to assign:

   We do:
     Step 1: Assign non-cycle edges. We must assign all non-cycle edges. There are n - L non-cycle edges? 
        Actually, the entire graph has n edges. The cycle has L edges, so non-cycle has n - L edges? 
        But note: the graph is connected with n nodes and one cycle. The cycle has L nodes and L edges. The non-cycle part (trees attached to the cycle) has n - L nodes? 
        Actually, the graph has n edges and n nodes. The cycle is of length L (so L edges and L nodes). The rest of the graph (non-cycle) has n - L nodes and n - L edges? 
        No: the entire graph has n edges. The non-cycle edges are the ones that are not in the cycle. The number of non-cycle edges is n - L.

        But note: the leaf removal removes one leaf at a time and removes one edge. So the number of non-cycle edges is exactly the number of edges removed? 
        And the remaining cycle has L edges and L nodes. Therefore, the non-cycle edges are n - L.

     Step 2: Now we have k' = k - (n - L) workers left. We need to assign at least L-1 cycle edges. So if we have less than L-1 workers available, we fail.

     However, note: we might have already used some workers that could have been used for cycle edges? 

   We need a matching that does not use the same worker twice.

   Approach:

   We have a bipartite graph: left side = edges (non-cycle and cycle), right side = workers.

   But note: we have two sets of edges with different priorities: non-cycle must be built, cycle we can skip one.

   Plan:

   We will do two bipartite matchings:

     Phase 1: Assign non-cycle edges. 
        For each non-cycle edge, we assign a worker that is available (i.e., the worker's material is in the edge's material set) and that worker is not used.

        We can use a DFS for bipartite matching for the non-cycle edges.

     Phase 2: Assign cycle edges. 
        We require at least L-1 of the cycle edges to be assigned. 
        We can try to assign the cycle edges using the workers that have not been used in non-cycle edges.

        We do another bipartite matching for the cycle edges, but only considering the workers that are not used in non-cycle edges.

   However, note: a worker might be available for a cycle edge even if it was not available for non-cycle edges? 

   But in our matching, we have:

     For each edge (both non-cycle and cycle), we precompute the list of workers that can build that edge (by material).

   For non-cycle edges, we assign workers. Then for cycle edges, we only consider the workers that are not assigned to any non-cycle edge.

   Steps:

     Precomputation:
        Build a mapping: for each material, list the worker indices that have that material.

        Then for each edge (by key = (min(u,v), max(u,v))), we have a list of materials. 
        Then the list of workers for that edge: for each material in the edge, if the material is in the mapping, then we take all worker indices from the mapping for that material.

        But note: we have k workers (indexed 0 to k-1). 

     Then:

        Let's create:
          non_cycle_edges: list of keys for non-cycle edges.
          cycle_edges: list of keys for cycle edges.

        We'll build two bipartite graphs: one for non_cycle_edges and one for cycle_edges (but cycle_edges matching only uses workers not taken by non_cycle_edges).

     We do:

        match_non = [ -1 ] * len(non_cycle_edges)   # for each non-cycle edge index, the worker assigned (-1 if none)
        match_worker = [ -1 ] * k   # for each worker, the non-cycle edge index assigned, or -1

        Then we run bipartite matching for non_cycle_edges. If we cannot assign all non-cycle edges -> output -1.

        Then for cycle_edges:

          We want to assign as many as possible, but we require at least L-1.

          We do bipartite matching for cycle_edges, but we skip the workers that are already assigned in non_cycle_edges.

        However, note: a worker might be in the list for a cycle edge and also for a non-cycle edge. But if we used that worker for a non-cycle edge, we cannot use it again.

        So for cycle_edges, we build a graph that only includes workers that are free (i.e., match_worker[worker] == -1).

        How? In the DFS for cycle edges, we only consider free workers.

        We do:

          match_cycle = [ -1 ] * len(cycle_edges)   # for each cycle edge index, the worker assigned
          match_worker_cycle = [ -1 ] * k   # for cycle edges: but note we are not going to use workers that are already taken? Actually, we skip taken workers.

        Actually, we can do:

          For each cycle edge, we have a list of workers that can build it. Then we filter that list to only include workers that are not assigned in non_cycle_edges.

          Then run bipartite matching for cycle_edges on the remaining workers.

        Then, if the number of matched cycle edges is at least L-1, we are good.

        But note: we can skip one cycle edge arbitrarily. So we don't care which one we skip. However, we have to decide which one to skip.

        But in the assignment, we can skip any one cycle edge. So if we have matched M_cycle cycle edges, then we can skip one of the unmatched ones? 
        However, if we have matched L-1, then we skip one edge arbitrarily? Actually, we can skip an unmatched edge. 

        But if we have matched all L cycle edges, then we don't need to skip any? Then we have built the entire graph? 

        However, we are only required to form a connected graph. The entire graph is connected. But we are allowed to build more than n-1? 

        Actually, the problem says: "assign each worker to construct a road" meaning that we can build more than n-1? 

        But note: we have k workers. We are allowed to build at most k roads, and we can build at most min(k, n) roads? 

        However, we must build at least n-1. 

        But the problem does not require to build exactly a spanning tree. It requires that the graph is connected. 

        So if we build the entire graph (n edges) and n<=k, that's acceptable.

        But what if k > n? Then we can build at most n roads (one per edge) and then leave the remaining workers idle.

        Therefore:

          If we have:
            non_cycle_edges: n - L (must be built) -> matched all.
            cycle_edges: we matched M_cycle (which must be at least L-1).

          Then we have built (n-L) + M_cycle roads. This is at least (n-L) + (L-1) = n-1.

          But we might have built more: if M_cycle = L, then we built n roads.

        How to output:

          We have two sets of assignments: non_cycle_edges and cycle_edges (except we skip one cycle edge to form a spanning tree?).

          Actually, we don't have to skip an edge if we built the entire graph? The entire graph is connected. 

          However, we are constrained by the workers: we can only build one edge per worker. 

          Therefore, we can build:

            Option 1: Build all non-cycle edges and all cycle edges (if we have enough workers: k>=n) and we matched all cycle edges? Then we build the entire graph.

            Option 2: Build all non-cycle edges and L-1 cycle edges (then we skip one cycle edge arbitrarily).

          But note: we might have matched all cycle edges, but then we have k >= n, so we built n edges. 

          However, what if k >= n, but we did not match all cycle edges? Then we cannot build the entire graph? Then we must skip the unmatched ones? 

          Actually, we are skipping one cycle edge arbitrarily: we can choose to skip one of the cycle edges that is unmatched? 

          But we require at least L-1 cycle edges to be built. So if we have matched M_cycle = L-1, then we skip one edge arbitrarily (which is already unmatched). 

          However, if we have matched M_cycle = L-1, then we skip one edge arbitrarily? Actually, we don't need to skip an edge that we didn't build? 

          But if we built L-1 cycle edges, then we have skipped one cycle edge. 

          But note: we might have an unmatched cycle edge that we could have built if we had a worker? But we didn't assign a worker to it. So we skip it.

          Therefore, the plan:

            We must build all non-cycle edges: n-L edges.

            We must build at least L-1 cycle edges.

            Then the total built is at least n-1 -> connected.

            We do not have to skip an edge that we did not build. 

          But what if we built L cycle edges? Then we have built the entire graph. 

          However, we are constrained by the workers: we have k workers. We have used (n-L) + M_cycle workers. 

          We require k >= (n-L) + (L-1) = n-1.

          But we already know k>=n-1? Actually, we checked at the beginning: if k < n-1 then output -1.

          However, we might have k>=n-1 and we have built n-1 or more.

          How to output:

            We have:

              non_cycle_edges: each is built and assigned to a worker.

              cycle_edges: we have built M_cycle edges (which is at least L-1). 

            Then we skip the cycle edges that are not built? 

          But note: we might have built more than L-1? Then we don't skip any? 

          Actually, the problem does not require to form a tree. It requires connectivity. The entire graph is connected even if we build all cycle edges.

          Therefore, we can output:

            For each non-cycle edge: assign the worker we matched.

            For each cycle edge: assign the worker we matched (if we matched it) and if we didn't match it, we skip it.

          But wait: we require at least L-1 cycle edges to be built. And we built M_cycle which is at least L-1. 

          However, we might have built M_cycle = L-1, and then we skip the one that we didn't build. 

          But if we built M_cycle = L, then we built all cycle edges.

          So we don't have to skip any edge arbitrarily? 

          But note: we might have built M_cycle = L, but then we have k >= n. 

          However, what if k > n? Then we have some workers that are not assigned. We output 0 0 for them.

          But note: we did not assign workers to all cycle edges? 

          Actually, in the cycle matching, we only assigned M_cycle edges (which is at least L-1, and at most L). 

          So the cycle edges that we matched are built, and the ones we didn't match are skipped.

          Therefore, we output:

            For non-cycle edges: the worker assigned to that edge outputs the edge.

            For cycle edges: the worker assigned to that edge (if any) outputs the edge.

            For the remaining workers: output 0 0.

          However, we must output in the order of the workers (the i-th worker in input order).

          How we stored:

            We have an array for the result: `res = ['0 0'] * k`

            For each non-cycle edge, we know the worker assigned: we store the edge in that worker's output.

            For each cycle edge that we matched, we store the edge in the assigned worker's output.

          But note: we did two matchings: non-cycle and cycle. The non-cycle matching used workers that we matched. The cycle matching used workers that were not used in non-cycle.

          Therefore, we don't conflict.

     However, what if we have a worker that can be used for both a non-cycle edge and a cycle edge? 

        We first assigned the non-cycle edge to that worker. Then the worker is not available for the cycle edge.

        That's correct.

8. Implementation:

   Steps:

     Step 1: Parse input.

     Step 2: Build the graph: 
          graph = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]
          for i from 1 to n:
             u = i, v = A_i
             add edge (u, v)

     Step 3: Identify non-cycle edges by leaf removal:

          deg[i] = degree of node i (from graph)
          q = deque()
          for i from 1 to n: if deg[i]==1, push i.

          non_cycle_edges_set = set()
          while q:
             pop u
             for each neighbor v of u that has deg[v] > 0:
                 edge (min(u,v), max(u,v)) is non-cycle -> add to non_cycle_edges_set.
                 deg[u] = 0 (we remove u) and deg[v] -= 1.
                 if deg[v] becomes 1, push v.

          Then the cycle_edges_set = all edges not in non_cycle_edges_set.

     Step 4: Precompute the material to workers mapping:

          material_to_workers: dictionary mapping material -> list of worker indices (0-indexed)

     Step 5: For each edge (both non-cycle and cycle), we represent by key = (min(u,v), max(u,v)), and we know the materials from the proposal.

          How to know which city proposed it? The input gives for city i: the edge (i, A_i). 
          So we can store for each key: the materials from the city that proposed it? 

          Actually, for the edge (i, A_i), we have the materials in B_i. But note: the same edge is not proposed by two cities (by the condition).

          Therefore, we can store:

            materials_dict = {}
            for i from 1 to n:
                u = i
                v = A[i]
                key = (min(u, v), max(u, v))
                materials_dict[key] = B_i   (the list of materials for city i)

          Also, we want to remember the original representation: but the problem says "in any order". So we can output (u, v) or (v, u). 
          However, we stored the key as (min, max). We can output the key as min and max? 

          But note: the sample output: 
            For the first worker: "1 2"
            For the fifth worker: "4 2" -> which is the same as (2,4) -> key (2,4) -> min=2, max=4.

          So we can output as (min, max) or (max, min)? The problem says "in any order". 

          However, we stored the key as (min, max). Then we can output: 
            For an edge (min, max): we output min then max? 
            But the sample fifth worker: edge (2,4) -> min=2, max=4 -> output "2 4", but sample output is "4 2". 

          The problem says: "in any order", so both are acceptable.

          However, the sample output for the fifth worker is "4 2". 

          To match the sample, we note: the edge for city 4: A_4 = 2 -> so for city 4, the edge is (4,2). 
          So we can also store the original representation: we store for key (min(u,v), max(u,v)) the tuple (u, v) as in the proposal? 
          But the problem does not require the order. 

          But note: the sample output for the fifth worker is "4 2", which is the order as in city 4's proposal? 

          However, the problem does not require the order. We can output in any order.

          So we can output the edge as (min, max) or (max, min). Both are acceptable.

          But to be consistent, we'll output the edge as (min, max) in our result? 

          However, the sample input: 
            City 1: A_1=2 -> edge (1,2) -> key=(1,2) -> we output "1 2"
            City 2: A_2=3 -> edge (2,3) -> key=(2,3) -> output "2 3"
            City 3: A_3=4 -> edge (3,4) -> key=(3,4) -> output "3 4"
            City 4: A_4=2 -> edge (4,2) -> key=(2,4) -> we output "2 4" or "4 2"? 

          The sample output for the fifth worker is "4 2". 

          How did we store the key? We stored as (min, max): for city 4: min(4,2)=2, max=4 -> key=(2,4). 

          So if we output as "2 4", that would be different from the sample.

          But the problem says: in any order. So we can output either.

          However, the sample expects "4 2" for the fifth worker. How to achieve that?

          We note: for the edge (4,2) proposed by city 4, we stored the key as (2,4). 

          We also stored the original representation: we can store for each key the representation as (u, v) from the city that proposed it? 

          Actually, we know: for the edge (min, max), the city that proposed it is either min or max? 

          But we don't know which one. However, we know that the city that proposed it is the one that has the edge in the input. 

          We can store:

            original_rep = {}   # key: (min, max) -> (u, v) as in the proposal (which is (i, A_i) for some i)

          Then when we output, we output the original representation? 

          But note: the same edge is only proposed by one city. 

          So for key (2,4): we know that it was proposed by city 4: because A_4=2 -> so the representation is (4,2). 

          How to store: when we read city i, we have an edge from i to A_i. Then we set:

            key = (min(i, A_i), max(i, A_i))
            original_rep[key] = (i, A_i)   # or we can store as (A_i, i)? 

          But the problem does not require a particular order. However, if we store (i, A_i), then for city 4: (4,2). 

          Then when we output the edge for the worker, we output: f"{u} {v}" from the tuple (u, v) = (4,2) -> "4 2".

          This matches the sample.

          Therefore, we do:

            original_rep = {}
            for i from 1 to n:
                u = i
                v = A[i]
                key = (min(u, v), max(u, v))
                original_rep[key] = (u, v)   # storing the representation as (i, A_i)

          Then when we assign a worker to an edge with key, we output: 
              res[worker_index] = f"{original_rep[key][0]} {original_rep[key][1]}"

     Step 6: For each edge (key), we precompute the list of workers that can build it:

          worker_list_by_key = {}
          for key in all_edges (non_cycle_edges_list and cycle_edges_list):
              materials = materials_dict[key]
              worker_list = []
              for each material in materials:
                  if material in material_to_workers:
                      for worker_index in material_to_workers[material]:
                          worker_list.append(worker_index)
              # We note: there might be duplicates? But the same worker might appear multiple times? 
              # But for a given material, the same worker is only once. However, if the same worker has multiple materials that are in the list? 
              # But the worker has only one material. So no duplicates.

          Then store worker_list_by_key[key] = worker_list.

     Step 7: Matching for non_cycle_edges:

          Let non_cycle_edges_list = list of non_cycle_edges (each is a key).

          We want to assign each non-cycle edge to a distinct worker.

          We do:

            match_non = [-1] * len(non_cycle_edges_list)   # match_non[i] = worker index assigned to the i-th non-cycle edge, or -1
            match_worker = [-1] * k   # for each worker, the index of non-cycle edge assigned, or -1 if not assigned.

          Then we run bipartite matching for non_cycle_edges_list.

          For each edge index i in non_cycle_edges_list:

            worker_list = worker_list_by_key[non_cycle_edges_list[i]]

            Then we try to find a worker in worker_list that is either free or we can reassign the worker's current edge to another worker? 
            But we do standard DFS for bipartite matching.

          We define:

            def dfs_non(i, seen):   # i: index in non_cycle_edges_list
                for worker_id in worker_list_by_key[non_cycle_edges_list[i]]:
                    if not seen[worker_id]:
                        seen[worker_id] = True
                        if match_worker[worker_id] == -1 or dfs_non(match_worker[worker_id], seen):
                            match_worker[worker_id] = i
                            match_non[i] = worker_id
                            return True
                return False

          Then for i in range(len(non_cycle_edges_list)):
              seen = [False] * k
              if not dfs_non(i, seen): 
                  print(-1)
                  return

     Step 8: Matching for cycle_edges:

          Now we consider cycle_edges_list.

          We want to assign as many as possible, but at least L-1.

          We do:

            match_cycle = [-1] * len(cycle_edges_list)   # for each cycle edge index, the worker assigned, or -1
            # We are only allowed to use workers that are not assigned in non_cycle_edges? 
            # So we create a separate array for cycle_edges matching? But note: we are going to assign the same worker? -> no, because a worker can only do one road.

            We can do:

            We'll create a separate array: match_worker_cycle = [-1] * k   # for cycle edges: but we will only consider workers that are free (i.e., match_worker[worker_id] == -1) OR not? 

            Actually, we already have match_worker: if match_worker[worker_id] != -1, then that worker is taken.

            So in the DFS for cycle_edges, we skip workers that are taken.

            How:

              worker_list = worker_list_by_key[cycle_edges_list[i]]
              filtered_worker_list = [w for w in worker_list if match_worker[w] == -1]

            But note: we don't want to use the workers that are already assigned (to non-cycle edges). 

            However, we can do:

              def dfs_cycle(i, seen):
                  for worker_id in worker_list_by_key[cycle_edges_list[i]]:
                      if match_worker[worker_id] != -1:   # this worker is already taken by a non-cycle edge -> skip
                          continue
                      if not seen[worker_id]:
                          seen[worker_id] = True
                          if match_worker_cycle[worker_id] == -1 or dfs_cycle(match_worker_cycle[worker_id], seen):
                              match_worker_cycle[worker_id] = i
                              match_cycle[i] = worker_id
                              return True
                  return False

            Then we run:

              M_cycle = 0
              for i in range(len(cycle_edges_list)):
                  seen = [False] * k
                  if dfs_cycle(i, seen):
                      M_cycle += 1

            Then if M_cycle < L-1: output -1.

     Step 9: Now we have:

          non_cycle_edges: all assigned.
          cycle_edges: we assigned M_cycle (>= L-1) edges.

          Total edges built: (n-L) + M_cycle, which is at least n-1.

          But note: we might have built M_cycle = L? Then we built all cycle edges.

          However, we don't need to skip any edge arbitrarily? 

          But wait: if we built M_cycle = L, then we built the entire graph. That's connected.

          But if we built M_cycle = L-1, then we skipped one cycle edge? But actually we skipped the unmatched one. 

          However, we are building the entire graph? 

          But note: we are building the non-cycle edges and the cycle edges that we matched. 

          The graph is connected because the non-cycle edges connect the tree parts to the cycle, and the cycle has L-1 edges (which still forms a connected cycle? Actually, L-1 edges in a cycle of L nodes forms a tree? 

          Actually, if we have a cycle of L nodes and we remove one edge, we get a tree. 

          Therefore, we don't have to do anything else.

          But note: what if we built M_cycle = L? Then we built the entire cycle? That's still connected.

          However, what if we built M_cycle = L, but then we have k >= n? Then we built n edges. 

          But we are allowed to build more than n-1? 

          Yes.

          Therefore, we can output:

            We have an array `res` of size k, initialized to "0 0".

            For each non-cycle edge i:
                worker_id = match_non[i]
                key = non_cycle_edges_list[i]
                u, v = original_rep[key]
                res[worker_id] = f"{u} {v}"

            For each cycle edge i:
                worker_id = match_cycle[i]
                if worker_id != -1:   # then we built this cycle edge
                    key = cycle_edges_list[i]
                    u, v = original_rep[key]
                    res[worker_id] = f"{u} {v}"

            Then for worker_id from 0 to k-1, we output res[worker_id] in order.

     However, what if we built M_cycle = L? Then we built all cycle edges. 

     But note: we have a problem: what if we have k > n? Then we have workers that are not assigned. They output "0 0".

     This is acceptable.

     But wait: what if we have k = n, and we built n edges? Then no worker is idle.

     But what if k = n-1? Then we built exactly n-1 edges? But note: we built n-L (non-cycle) and M_cycle (cycle) = at least L-1 -> total at least n-1. 
        And we have k = n-1, so we built exactly n-1 edges.

     This is acceptable.

9. But wait: what if we built M_cycle = L? Then we built n edges. But we have k = n-1? 

        We checked at the beginning: if k < n-1 -> output -1. 
        But k = n-1 is acceptable. However, we built n edges? That would require n workers. But we only have n-1 workers. 

        How did we get M_cycle = L? 

        We built non_cycle_edges: n-L edges -> requires n-L workers.
        Then we built cycle_edges: L edges -> requires L workers -> total n workers.

        But k = n-1 -> we don't have n workers. 

        Therefore, in the cycle_edges matching, we only consider workers that are free (not used in non-cycle). How many free workers? k - (n-L) = (n-1) - (n-L) = L-1.

        So we can only assign at most L-1 cycle edges. 

        Therefore, M_cycle cannot be L if k = n-1. 

        So we are safe.

10. However, we have a problem: 

        In the cycle matching, we did not consider workers that are already assigned to non-cycle edges. 

        But note: we have k workers. We assigned n-L workers to non-cycle edges. Then we have k - (n-L) workers left. 

        We need at least L-1 workers for cycle edges. 

        Therefore, we require k - (n-L) >= L-1? 
          => k >= n-1.

        But we already know k>=n-1? 

        Actually, we checked at the beginning: if k < n-1 -> output -1.

        But note: k>=n-1 is necessary but not sufficient: we might not have the material matches.

        So the above matching steps must be done.

11. But note: what if we have k>=n, but we did not match all non-cycle edges? 

        We already matched all non-cycle edges? We did the non-cycle matching and if we failed, we output -1.

        Then for cycle_edges, we matched at least L-1? If not, we output -1.

        Then we built at least n-1 edges.

        And we have k>=n, so we built at least n-1 and at most n edges? 

        Actually, we built n-L + M_cycle, which is between n-1 and n.

        So we are good.

12. However, what if we have k>=n, and we matched all non-cycle edges and only L-1 cycle edges? Then we built n-1 edges. 

        Then we have k - (n-1) workers left. We output 0 0 for them.

13. But what if we have k>=n and we matched all non-cycle and all cycle edges? Then we built n edges. 

        Then we have k - n workers left -> output 0 0.

14. Therefore, we output:

        res = ['0 0'] * k
        for i in range(len(non_cycle_edges_list)):
            worker_id = match_non[i]
            key = non_cycle_edges_list[i]
            u, v = original_rep[key]
            res[worker_id] = f"{u} {v}"

        for i in range(len(cycle_edges_list)):
            worker_id = match_cycle[i]
            if worker_id != -1:
                key = cycle_edges_list[i]
                u, v = original_rep[key]
                res[worker_id] = f"{u} {v}"

        for i in range(k):
            print(res[i])

15. But wait: what if a worker was matched in the cycle_edges matching? We stored it in match_cycle[i] and then we set res[worker_id] = ... 

        But note: the same worker cannot be matched in both non_cycle and cycle.

        Because in the cycle matching, we skipped workers that were already in non_cycle.

        And in non_cycle matching, we assigned the worker to one non_cycle edge.

        So no conflict.

16. However, we have a critical issue: the cycle_edges matching uses the same `match_worker_cycle` array? 

        Actually, we stored the cycle_edges assignments in a separate array: `match_worker_cycle` and `match_cycle`. 

        And we do not use the global `match_worker` for non_cycle for anything in the cycle matching except to skip taken workers.

        Then when we output, we use:

          For non_cycle: we use the worker_id from `match_non[i]` (which is stored in `match_worker` for non_cycle) to set the result for that worker.

          For cycle: we use the worker_id from `match_cycle[i]` (which is stored in `match_worker_cycle`) to set the result for that worker.

        But note: `match_cycle[i]` is the worker_id assigned to cycle edge i. And we know that worker_id was free (not assigned in non_cycle) by our filtering.

        So we don't override the non_cycle assignments.

17. One more issue: 

        What if a worker appears in the list for a cycle edge and also for a non_cycle edge? 

        We first assigned it to a non_cycle edge. Then in the cycle_edges matching, we skip that worker. 

        That's correct.

18. But what if a worker can build two cycle edges? 

        In the cycle_edges matching, we do a bipartite matching: one worker to one edge. 

        That's correct.

19. But note: the bipartite matching for non_cycle_edges and cycle_edges are separate. 

        However, the cycle_edges matching is independent: we only use workers not taken by non_cycle.

20. Now, the sample input 1:

        n=4, k=5
        Cities:
          1: A1=2, M1=2, materials=[1,2]
          2: A2=3, M2=2, materials=[2,3]
          3: A3=4, M3=2, materials=[3,4]
          4: A4=2, M4=2, materials=[4,5]

        Workers: [1,2,3,4,5]

        Graph: 
          edges: (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,2)  -> 4 edges.

        Leaf removal: 
          deg: 
            node1: deg=1 -> leaf -> remove edge (1,2): mark as non-cycle. Then node2: deg becomes 3 -> not leaf.
          Then no more leaves -> cycle: [2,3,4] -> edges (2,3), (3,4), (4,2) are cycle.

        Non-cycle: only (1,2)
        Cycle: (2,3), (3,4), (4,2)

        Then we do non-cycle matching for edge (1,2): 
          materials: [1,2] -> workers: 
            worker0: material1 -> can build.
            worker1: material2 -> can build.
          We assign, say, worker0 to edge (1,2).

        Then we do cycle_edges matching with the remaining workers: [1,2,3,4] (index 1 to 4)

          Edge (2,3): materials [2,3] -> workers: worker1 (material2), worker2 (material3) -> available workers: [1,2,3,4] -> both 1 and 2 are available.
          We assign worker1 to (2,3).

          Edge (3,4): materials [3,4] -> workers: worker2 (material3), worker3 (material4) -> assign worker2 to (3,4).

          Edge (4,2): materials [4,5] -> workers: worker3 (material4) and worker4 (material5) -> assign worker3? But then worker4 is left? 

          However, we only require 2 (L-1=2) of the cycle edges. We have assigned 3? Actually, we don't need to assign all? 

          But we are doing a matching: we try to assign as many as possible. 

          We require at least L-1 = 2. We assigned 3, so we are good.

        Then we output:

          worker0: (1,2) -> "1 2"
          worker1: (2,3) -> "2 3"
          worker2: (3,4) -> "3 4"
          worker3: (4,2) -> "4 2"
          worker4: not assigned -> "0 0"

        But the sample output for the fifth worker is "4 2", meaning worker4 (the fifth worker, index4) should output "4 2". 

        But we assigned worker3 to (4,2) and worker4 is idle.

        The sample output:

          worker0: "1 2"
          worker1: "2 3"
          worker2: "3 4"
          worker3: "0 0"   -> but we have worker3 assigned to (4,2) -> so we output "4 2" for worker3? 
          worker4: "4 2"   -> but then we have two workers building the same road? 

        This is a problem: we cannot assign two workers to the same road.

        What went wrong? 

        The sample output:

          worker0: "1 2"
          worker1: "2 3"
          worker2: "3 4"
          worker3: "0 0"
          worker4: "4 2"

        So worker4 (the fifth worker) builds (4,2).

        How did we assign? 

          We assigned:
            non-cycle edge (1,2) to worker0 (material1) -> that's the first worker.
            cycle edge (2,3) to worker1 (material2) -> second worker.
            cycle edge (3,4) to worker2 (material3) -> third worker.
            cycle edge (4,2) to worker4 (material5) -> because the materials for (4,2) are [4,5]: 
                worker3 has material4 -> but we assigned worker3 to the non-cycle? No, non-cycle only took worker0. 
                Then worker3 is free? 
                worker4 has material5 -> so we can assign worker4 to (4,2).

          Then worker3 is idle.

        Therefore, we should not assign worker3 to (4,2) because worker3 has material4? 
          But the edge (4,2) requires material 4 or 5. 
          Worker3 has material4 -> so he can build it. 
          But we did not assign worker3 to any non-cycle edge? 

          Why didn't we assign worker3 to (4,2)? 

        In our cycle_edges matching, we did:

          We started with the list of cycle_edges: [(2,3), (3,4), (4,2)]

          We did:

            for edge0: (2,3): worker_list = [1,2] -> we assign worker1 -> then mark worker1 as taken in match_worker_cycle? 
            for edge1: (3,4): worker_list = [2,3] -> we assign worker2? 
            for edge2: (4,2): worker_list = [3,4] -> then we try worker3: 
                 if match_worker[worker3] is -1 (which it is) -> then we can assign.

          So we assign worker3 to (4,2). 

        But the sample output has worker4 building (4,2). 

        Why not worker4? 

          Because we can assign worker3? Then worker4 is left. 

        But the problem says: we must output in the same order as the workers? 

          The workers are given: [1,2,3,4,5] -> worker0: material1, worker1: material2, worker2: material3, worker3: material4, worker4: material5.

        The sample output:

          first worker: 1 2 -> worker0
          second worker: 2 3 -> worker1
          third worker: 3 4 -> worker2
          fourth worker: 0 0 -> worker3: we assigned worker3 to (4,2) -> but then we output "0 0" for worker3? 

        We must output for each worker in the order of input.

        Our output array `res` is indexed by worker_id.

        We set:

          worker0: (1,2) -> "1 2"
          worker1: (2,3) -> "2 3"
          worker2: (3,4) -> "3 4"
          worker3: (4,2) -> "4 2"
          worker4: not assigned -> "0 0"

        Then we output:

          worker0: "1 2"
          worker1: "2 3"
          worker2: "3 4"
          worker3: "4 2"
          worker4: "0 0"

        But the sample output for the fifth worker is "4 2", meaning worker4? 

        The sample output:

          Line 1: "1 2"   -> worker0
          Line 2: "2 3"   -> worker1
          Line 3: "3 4"   -> worker2
          Line 4: "0 0"   -> worker3
          Line 5: "4 2"   -> worker4

        How can worker4 build (4,2)? 

          The road (4,2) requires material 4 or 5. 
          Worker4 has material5 -> so it can build.

        Why didn't we assign worker4 to (4,2) instead of worker3? 

        Because in the bipartite matching, we found worker3 first? 

        But we want to leave worker3 idle and use worker4? 

        The problem does not require a specific assignment. But the problem says: "if the worker does not construct any road, output 0 0".

        And the sample output for worker3 is 0 0 and for worker4 is "4 2". 

        How can we achieve that? 

          We can try to assign the workers arbitrarily? 

          But our bipartite matching for cycle_edges: we iterate the edges in the order of cycle_edges_list. 

          And for each edge, we iterate the workers in the order of the worker_list? 

          The worker_list for (4,2): [3,4] -> because the materials are [4,5]. 
          When we built the worker_list: 
             for material 4: we get worker3 (and any others? but worker3 is the only one with 4)
             for material 5: we get worker4.

          Then the list is [3,4]. 

          Then we try worker3 first. 

          We can change the order: if we try worker4 first? 

          But the problem does not specify which worker to assign.

          However, the problem says: "You may output any assignment as long as any pair of cities are connected by a sequence of constructed road."

          Therefore, both assignments are acceptable. 

          But the sample output uses worker4 for (4,2) and leaves worker3 idle.

        How to match the sample output? 

          We can change the DFS to try workers in the reverse order? 

          Or we can note: the problem does not require to use the smallest worker index? 

          Actually, the problem does not specify. 

          But the sample input for workers: [1,2,3,4,5] -> the materials: 1,2,3,4,5.

          The sample output: 
            worker0: (1,2) -> material1 -> matches.
            worker1: (2,3) -> material2 -> matches.
            worker2: (3,4) -> material3 -> matches.
            worker3: idle -> material4 -> not used? 
            worker4: (4,2) -> material5 -> matches.

          This assignment is valid.

          Our assignment:

            worker0: (1,2): material1 -> valid.
            worker1: (2,3): material2 -> valid.
            worker2: (3,4): material3 -> valid.
            worker3: (4,2): material4 -> valid? The edge (4,2) allows material4 -> valid.
            worker4: idle.

          This is also valid.

        The problem does not require a specific assignment. 

        However, the sample output matches the worker's material: 
            worker0: material1 -> built (1,2) which requires [1,2] -> uses 1 -> matches.
            worker1: material2 -> built (2,3) which requires [2,3] -> uses 2 -> matches.
            worker2: material3 -> built (3,4) which requires [3,4] -> uses 3 -> matches.
            worker3: idle.
            worker4: material5 -> built (4,2) which requires [4,5] -> uses 5 -> matches.

        But in our assignment, we used material4 for (4,2) by worker3. 

        The sample output uses material5 for (4,2) by worker4.

        Both are valid.

        But the problem says: output in the same order as the workers. 

          For worker3 (the fourth worker) we output "0 0", and for worker4 (the fifth worker) we output "4 2".

        How can we get that? 

          We must assign the worker4 to (4,2) and leave worker3 idle.

        How? 

          We can change the worker_list for (4,2) to be [4,3]? 

          But we built the worker_list by iterating the materials in the order given? 

          The materials: [4,5] -> 
            for material4: worker_list: [worker3] 
            for material5: worker_list: [worker4]

          Then the list is [3,4] (because we appended in the order of materials? and we iterated the materials in increasing order?).

          We can sort the worker_list by worker_id? 

          But we want to assign the worker4 (which has a higher index) only if we have to? 

          Alternatively, we can try to assign the cycle_edges in any order? 

          But note: our DFS for bipartite matching for cycle_edges: we iterate the edges in the order of cycle_edges_list and for each edge, we iterate the workers in the worker_list.

          We can change the worker_list to be sorted by worker_id? 

          But that doesn't help: worker3=3, worker4=4 -> we try worker3 first.

          Alternatively, we can change the order of the cycle_edges_list? 

          How did we get cycle_edges_list? 

          cycle_edges_set -> list: the order is arbitrary? 

          We have: 
            cycle_edges_list = list(cycle_edges_set) -> but the set is unordered.

          We built the set by: 
            non_cycle_edges_set = set of edges we removed by leaf removal.
            cycle_edges_set = set of edges that are not in non_cycle_edges_set.

          Then we converted to list: the order might be arbitrary.

          We want to assign the edge (4,2) last? Then when we assign (4,2), worker3 might have been taken by another edge? 

          But the other edges: (2,3) and (3,4) do not require material4? 

          So worker3 is free until we get to (4,2). 

          Then we assign worker3 to (4,2) if we try worker3 first.

        Therefore, to match the sample output, we need to assign worker4 to (4,2) and leave worker3 idle.

        How? 

          We can reverse the worker_list for each edge? 

          Then for (4,2): worker_list becomes [4,3] -> then we try worker4 first -> then we assign worker4 to (4,2). 

          Then worker3 is not used.

        But the problem does not require a specific assignment. 

        However, the problem says: "You may output any assignment". 

        Therefore, we can do:

          For each edge, we reverse the worker_list? 

          Why? Because we want to try the workers with higher index first? 

          Then we might leave the lower-indexed workers free for other edges? 

          But in this case, for (4,2) we try worker4 first -> then we assign worker4 to (4,2) -> then worker3 is left idle.

        This matches the sample output.

        But note: what if we have an edge that has two materials: [4,5] and workers [3,4] -> then if we reverse the worker_list to [4,3] and we try worker4 first, we assign worker4. 

        Then worker3 is free.

        This is acceptable.

        But why not try to use the worker with the highest material? 

        Actually, it does not matter. 

        However, to match the sample output, we do:

          worker_list = sorted(worker_list, reverse=True)   # so that we try the higher worker index first? 

          But note: worker_list is a list of worker indices. 

          We want to assign worker4 (index4) before worker3 (index3). 

          So we can sort in descending order? 

          Then for (4,2): worker_list = sorted([3,4], reverse=True) = [4,3] -> then we try worker4 first.

        But what if we have worker0, worker1, worker2? 

          We don't care? 

        However, we have to be cautious: we are doing DFS and matching. The order of the worker_list might affect the matching? 

        But we are allowed any valid assignment.

        Therefore, we can do:

          For each edge, we sort the worker_list in descending order? 

          Why descending? Because we want to use the worker with the highest index first? Then leave the lower indices free? 

          But we don't have a requirement to use the highest index. 

          However, the sample output uses worker4 for (4,2) and leaves worker3 idle. 

          We can do that by reversing the worker_list for each edge? 

          But note: the worker_list is built by iterating the materials in increasing order. 

          Then for an edge, we have the list of workers by the order of increasing material? 

          But the materials are sorted: the input gives the materials in increasing order. 

          Then we build the worker_list by:

            for material in sorted order (increasing) -> then we get workers in the order of the materials? 

          But then we append the workers for material1, then material2, etc. 

          The worker indices for the same material? The workers for a material: the list of worker indices that have that material. 

          How are these stored? We built material_to_workers as a dictionary. 

          Then for a given material, the worker indices: we stored in the order of input? 

          The workers input: we read k integers: the first worker is worker0, then worker1, etc.

          Then for a material, the list of workers is sorted by the worker index? 

          Actually, we appended in the order of the workers: for worker_id from 0 to k-1, we appended to the list for material c_i.

          Then for a material, the worker indices are in increasing order? 

          Then for an edge, the worker_list is:

            for material in increasing order: 
                then the workers for that material: in increasing order of worker_id.

          So the entire worker_list is sorted by material and then by worker_id? 

          But we want to try the worker with the highest worker_id first? 

          We can reverse the entire worker_list? 

          Or we can sort by worker_id descending? 

          But note: the problem does not specify. 

          However, to match the sample output, we can sort the worker_list for each edge by worker_id in descending order.

        Steps:

          For each edge (key), after building the worker_list, we do:

            worker_list.sort(reverse=True)   # so that we try the worker with the largest index first.

          Then in the DFS, we iterate the worker_list in that sorted order.

        Why? 

          In the sample: 
             edge (4,2): worker_list = [3,4] -> then we sort descending: [4,3] -> then we try worker4 first.

          Then we assign worker4 to (4,2) and leave worker3 free.

        Then in the output, for worker3 (the fourth worker) we output "0 0", and for worker4 (the fifth worker) we output "4 2".

        This matches the sample.

        Therefore, we add:

          for key in all_edges:
              worker_list = ... (as above)
              worker_list.sort(reverse=True)   # sort by worker_id descending

        But note: the workers are 0-indexed. The worker with a higher index is the one that appears later in the input.

        We want to use the workers that appear later in the input first? 

        Why? Because the sample output uses the fifth worker (index4) for (4,2) and leaves the fourth worker (index3) idle.

        This is acceptable.

        However, we must be cautious: what if we have two edges that can be built by the same worker? 

          We want to assign the worker to one of them? 

          The DFS matching: we iterate the edges in the order of the list (non_cycle_edges_list and cycle_edges_list) and for each edge, we try workers in descending order.

          This might lead to using a worker with a higher index for an edge that comes first, and then a worker with a lower index might be left for a later edge.

          But we are doing DFS: it might backtrack. 

          However, we are not changing the order of edges? 

          We are only changing the order of workers for a fixed edge.

          This might affect the matching: we might free a lower-indexed worker for a more critical edge? 

          But we don't have a critical edge: we only care about matching all non-cycle and then at least L-1 cycle.

        Therefore, we do:

          After building worker_list for a key: worker_list.sort(reverse=True)

        But note: the non_cycle_edges matching: we also need to do the same? 

          The sample output for non_cycle_edges: (1,2) is assigned to the first worker (worker0). 

          But if we reverse the worker_list for (1,2): 
              worker_list = [0,1] -> sorted descending: [1,0] -> then we try worker1 first? 
              Then we assign worker1 to (1,2). 

          Then worker0 is free. 

          Then for the cycle_edges: 
             (2,3): we have worker_list = [0,1] -> but wait, worker1 is taken? 
             Actually, we built the non_cycle_edges first: we assigned worker1 to (1,2). 
             Then for (2,3): worker_list = [0,1] -> then we try worker0? 
             Then we assign worker0 to (2,3). 

          Then (3,4): worker_list = [2,3] -> we assign worker2? 
          Then (4,2): worker_list = [3,4] -> we assign worker3? 

          Then worker4 is idle.

          Then output:

             worker0: (2,3) -> "2 3"
             worker1: (1,2) -> "1 2"
             worker2: (3,4) -> "3 4"
             worker3: (4,2) -> "4 2"
             worker4: idle -> "0 0"

          But the sample output has worker0: "1 2", worker1: "2 3", ... 

          So the order of the workers in the output must be the same as the input order? 

          The worker0 is the first worker, so we output the assignment for worker0 first? 

          Our output array `res` is indexed by worker_id. Then we output:

             res[0] = "2 3"   -> first line: "2 3"
             res[1] = "1 2"   -> second line: "1 2"
             ...

          That does not match the sample.

        How did we store the result? 

          We store res[worker_id] = string.

          Then we output:

             for worker_id in range(k): 
                 print(res[worker_id])

          The first worker (worker0) -> res[0] -> "2 3"

          The second worker (worker1) -> res[1] -> "1 2"

          This is different from the sample.

        The sample input order of workers: [1,2,3,4,5] -> the first worker has material1 -> worker0.

          The sample output:

             Line1: "1 2" -> worker0: so we want res[0] = "1 2"
             Line2: "2 3" -> worker1: so we want res[1] = "2 3"

          Therefore, we must assign worker0 to (1,2) and worker1 to (2,3). 

        How to ensure that? 

          We can try the workers in ascending order for non_cycle_edges? 

          But then for cycle_edges, we try in descending order? 

          However, we want to leave the worker with a lower index free? 

          Actually, we don't care about leaving a particular worker free. 

          But the problem: we must output the assignment for the workers in the input order. 

          We are storing the result in an array `res` by worker_id. 

          How we assign the workers does not matter as long as the assignment is valid.

          However, the sample output has worker0 (first worker) building (1,2) and worker1 (second worker) building (2,3). 

          We can achieve that by:

            In the non_cycle_edges matching: for edge (1,2), we try workers in ascending order? 

          Therefore, we do:

            For non_cycle_edges: sort the worker_list in ascending order? 
            For cycle_edges: sort the worker_list in descending order? 

          Why? 

            non_cycle_edges: we want to use the worker with the smallest index? Then we leave higher indices for cycle_edges? 

            Then for non_cycle_edges: (1,2): worker_list = [0,1] -> ascending: [0,1] -> then we try worker0 first -> assign worker0.

            Then for cycle_edges: 
                (2,3): worker_list = [1,2] -> descending: [2,1] -> then we try worker2 first -> but we want worker1? 

          How to assign worker1 to (2,3)? 

            We want to use the worker1 for (2,3). 

          But if we sort the worker_list for cycle_edges in descending order, then we try worker2 first -> then we assign worker2 to (2,3). 

          Then worker1 is free? 

          Then (3,4): worker_list = [3,2] -> descending: [3,2] -> then we try worker3 -> assign worker3.
          Then (4,2): worker_list = [4,3] -> descending: [4,3] -> then we try worker4 -> assign worker4.

          Then worker1 is idle.

          Then output:

            worker0: (1,2) -> "1 2"
            worker1: idle -> "0 0"
            worker2: (2,3) -> "2 3"
            worker3: (3,4) -> "3 4"
            worker4: (4,2) -> "4 2"

          This does not match the sample.

        Alternatively, for non_cycle_edges, we sort the worker_list in ascending order, and for cycle_edges, we sort in ascending order? 

          Then for (2,3): worker_list = [1,2] -> ascending: [1,2] -> then we try worker1 first -> assign worker1.

          Then for (3,4): worker_list = [2,3] -> ascending: [2,3] -> we try worker2 -> assign worker2.
          Then for (4,2): worker_list = [3,4] -> ascending: [3,4] -> we try worker3 -> assign worker3.

          Then worker4 idle.

          Then output:

            worker0: (1,2) -> "1 2"
            worker1: (2,3) -> "2 3"
            worker2: (3,4) -> "3 4"
            worker3: (4,2) -> "4 2"
            worker4: "0 0"

          But the sample output has worker3 (fourth worker) as "0 0" and worker4 (fifth worker) as "4 2". 

          We have worker3 building (4,2) and worker4 idle.

        How to get worker4 to build (4,2) and leave worker3 idle? 

          We can for the edge (4,2) try worker4 first? 

          So we want for cycle_edges: sort the worker_list in descending order? 

          Then for (4,2): worker_list = [3,4] -> descending: [4,3] -> then we try worker4 -> assign worker4.

          Then worker3 is idle.

          But then we output for worker3: "0 0", and for worker4: "4 2".

          This matches.

        Therefore, we do:

          For non_cycle_edges: sort the worker_list in ascending order? 
          For cycle_edges: sort the worker_list in descending order? 

        But why different orders? 

          We want non_cycle_edges to use the smallest worker available (to leave the larger workers for cycle_edges) and then in cycle_edges we try the largest worker first? 

          This might help in the sample: 
             non_cycle_edges: (1,2): worker_list = [0,1] -> ascending: [0,1] -> use worker0.
             cycle_edges: 
                 (2,3): worker_list = [1,2] -> descending: [2,1] -> use worker2? 
                 (3,4): worker_list = [3] (if we remove worker2) -> [3] -> use worker3? 
                 (4,2): worker_list = [4] -> use worker4? 

          Then we have:
             worker0: (1,2)
             worker2: (2,3)
             worker3: (3,4)
             worker4: (4,2)
             worker1: idle.

          Then output for worker1: "0 0", which is the second worker? 

          The sample output for the second worker is "2 3", not "0 0". 

        Alternatively, we do not care about the sample's exact assignment as long as it is valid? 

          The problem allows any assignment. 

        However, the sample input/output #1 is provided for verification. 

        To pass the sample, we need to output:

          worker0: "1 2"
          worker1: "2 3"
          worker2: "3 4"
          worker3: "0 0"
          worker4: "4 2"

        How to achieve this with our bipartite matching? 

          non_cycle_edges: only one edge (1,2). 
            worker_list = [0,1] 
            If we sort in ascending order: [0,1] -> we try worker0 first -> assign worker0.

          cycle_edges: three edges: (2,3), (3,4), (4,2)

          For (2,3): worker_list = [1,2] -> if we sort in descending order: [2,1] -> then we try worker2 first -> assign worker2? 
          Then for (3,4): worker_list = [3] -> assign worker3.
          Then for (4,2): worker_list = [4] -> assign worker4.

          Then worker1 is idle.

          But we want worker1 to build (2,3)? 

          How to assign worker1 to (2,3)? 

          We could sort the worker_list for cycle_edges in ascending order? 
            (2,3): worker_list = [1,2] -> ascending: [1,2] -> then we try worker1 first -> assign worker1.

          Then for (3,4): worker_list = [2,3] -> ascending: [2,3] -> then we try worker2 first -> assign worker2.
          Then for (4,2): worker_list = [3,4] -> ascending: [3,4] -> then we try worker3 first -> assign worker3.

          Then worker4 is idle.

          Then output:

             worker0: "1 2"
             worker1: "2 3"
             worker2: "3 4"
             worker3: "4 2"
             worker4: "0 0"

          This is different from the sample.

        The sample output has worker4 (the last worker) build (4,2) and worker3 (the fourth worker) idle.

        Therefore, we need to leave worker3 idle and use worker4 for (4,2). 

        How? 

          Only by trying worker4 before worker3 for the edge (4,2). 

          So we sort the worker_list for (4,2) in descending order: [4,3] -> then we try worker4 first.

        But for the other edges, we don't care.

        Therefore, we can do:

          For each edge in cycle_edges, sort the worker_list in descending order? 

          Then for (2,3): worker_list = [1,2] -> sorted descending: [2,1] -> then we try worker2 first -> assign worker2? 
          Then (3,4): worker_list = [3,2] -> but worker2 is taken? -> then we have [3] -> assign worker3.
          Then (4,2): worker_list = [4,3] -> sorted descending: [4,3] -> try worker4 first -> assign worker4.

          Then worker1 is idle.

          But we want worker1 to build (2,3)? 

        Alternatively, we try to assign (2,3) to worker1 and leave worker2 for something else? 

          If we sort the worker_list for (2,3) in ascending order: [1,2] -> then we try worker1 first -> assign worker1.

          For (3,4): worker_list = [2,3] -> sorted in descending: [3,2] -> then try worker3 first -> assign worker3.
          For (4,2): worker_list = [4,3] -> sorted in descending: [4,3] -> then try worker4 first -> assign worker4.

          Then worker2 is idle.

          Then output:

             worker0: "1 2"
             worker1: "2 3"
             worker2: "0 0"
             worker3: "3 4"   -> but wait, the edge (3,4) is built by worker3 -> output "3 4"
             worker4: "4 2"

          This matches the sample in terms of the roads built, but not the worker order:

             The sample:
                 worker0: "1 2"
                 worker1: "2 3"
                 worker2: "3 4"   -> in our assignment, worker2 is idle and worker3 does "3 4", worker4 does "4 2"
                 worker3: "0 0"   -> we have worker2: "0 0", worker3: "3 4", worker4: "4 2"

          The sample output:

                 worker0: "1 2"
                 worker1: "2 3"
                 worker2: "3 4"
                 worker3: "0 0"
                 worker4: "4 2"

          In our assignment, worker2 is the one that is idle, not worker3.

        How to idle worker3? 

          We can avoid using worker3? 

          How? 

            For (3,4): we have worker_list = [2,3] -> if we try worker2 first (because descending: [3,2] -> then worker3 is first? 
            sorted descending: [3,2] -> try worker3 first -> assign worker3.

          Then worker2 is free.

          We want to use worker2 for nothing and worker3 for nothing? 

          But we have to build at least 2 cycle edges. We have built (2,3) and (3,4) and (4,2) -> 3 cycle edges, so we are good.

        Therefore, the output for workers:

          worker0: "1 2"
          worker1: "2 3"
          worker3: "3 4"   -> for the fourth worker (worker3) we output "3 4", but the sample output for the fourth worker is "0 0". 

          The sample output for the fourth worker is the fourth line: "0 0", and the third worker (worker2) outputs "3 4", and the fifth worker (worker4) outputs "4 2".

        But in our assignment, the worker3 is the fourth worker. 

        The sample expects the fourth worker to be idle.

        Therefore, we must not use worker3. 

        How? 

          We built (3,4) with worker3. But could we build it with worker2? 

          Yes: if we try worker2 first for (3,4). 

          Then we leave worker3 free.

          Then for (4,2): worker_list = [4,3] -> sorted descending: [4,3] -> try worker4 first -> assign worker4.

          Then worker3 is free.

          Then output:

             worker0: "1 2"
             worker1: "2 3"
             worker2: "3 4"   -> which is the third worker? 
             worker3: free -> fourth worker: "0 0"
             worker4: "4 2"   -> fifth worker: "4 2"

          This matches the sample.

        How to try worker2 first for (3,4)? 

          By sorting the worker_list for (3,4) in descending order: [ worker3, worker2 ] -> 
             worker3 has index3, worker2 has index2 -> descending by worker_id: [3,2] -> then we try worker3 first? 

          Then we would assign worker3 to (3,4), not worker2.

        Alternatively, if we sort by something else? 

        Idea: sort by worker_id descending for all cycle_edges. 

          (2,3): worker_list = [1,2] -> sorted: [2,1] -> then we try worker2 first -> assign worker2 to (2,3)? 
          (3,4): worker_list = [2,3] -> sorted: [3,2] -> then we try worker3 first -> assign worker3 to (3,4)? 
          (4,2): worker_list = [3,4] -> sorted: [4,3] -> then we try worker4 first -> assign worker4.

          Then worker1 is idle.

          not good.

        How about: for each edge, we sort the worker_list in ascending order of the worker_id for the non_cycle_edges, and for cycle_edges, we sort in descending order of the worker_id, EXCEPT that we give priority to workers that have not been used yet? 

        But they haven't been used yet in the cycle_edges matching? 

        This is complex.

        Alternatively, we can note: the sample output uses the workers in the order of the edge's necessity? 

        We can try to assign the cycle_edges in the order of increasing edge representation? 

        But the edge representation: (2,3), (3,4), (4,2) -> we don't have an inherent order.

        Given the complexity and that the problem allows any assignment, and that we passed the sample with one assignment (even if not exactly the sample output) is valid, we might not need to worry.

        But the sample provided an exact output.

        To be safe, we do:

          For non_cycle_edges: sort the worker_list in ascending order of worker_id.
          For cycle_edges: sort the worker_list in descending order of worker_id.

        And hope that the sample input is assigned as follows:

          non_cycle_edges (1,2): worker_list = [0,1] -> sorted ascending: [0,1] -> we try worker0 -> assign worker0.

          cycle_edges:
            (2,3): worker_list = [1,2] -> sorted descending: [2,1] -> try worker2 first -> assign worker2.
            (3,4): worker_list = [3] -> because worker2 is taken, so for (3,4): worker_list = [2,3] but then we remove worker2? -> 
                   actually, we built the worker_list by including only workers that are free (match_worker[worker] == -1) -> 
                   after non_cycle: worker0 is taken, worker1,2,3,4 are free.
                   Then for (3,4): worker_list = [2,3] -> sorted descending: [3,2] -> try worker3 first -> assign worker3.
            (4,2): worker_list = [4,3] -> sorted descending: [4,3] -> try worker4 first -> assign worker4.

          Then worker1 is free.

          Output:
             worker0: "1 2"
             worker1: "0 0"
             worker2: "2 3"
             worker3: "3 4"
             worker4: "4 2"

        This is valid, but does not match the sample output.

        If we want to match the sample output exactly, we would need to assign worker1 to (2,3) and worker2 to (3,4) and worker4 to (4,2) and worker3 free.

        How to do that automatically? 

          We might need a more sophisticated matching: we want to leave worker3 free. 
          How about: after matching the non_cycle_edges, for cycle_edges, we try to avoid using worker3 if possible. 

          We can try: 
             For (2,3): has worker_list = [1,2] -> if we can avoid using worker3, then we use worker1 or worker2.
             For (3,4): has worker_list = [2,3] -> if we avoid worker3, then we use worker2.
             For (4,2): has worker_list = [3,4] -> if we avoid worker3, then we use worker4.

          Then worker3 is free.

          This is the sample assignment.

        How to avoid worker3? 

          We can for each cycle edge, in the worker_list, we can try the workers in the order: first the ones that are not worker3, then worker3? 

          But then we are not sorting by worker_id.

        Alternatively, we can change the worker_list for each edge by reordering: put worker3 at the end.

        Specifically, we can do:

          for each cycle edge, we 
             worker_list = [w for w in worker_list if w is not in the set of workers we want to avoid] 
          ? 

          But we don't know which worker to avoid.

        Given the complexity and time, and since the problem allows any assignment, we will output any valid assignment.

        We'll do: 
          non_cycle_edges: sort worker_list in ascending order.
          cycle_edges: sort worker_list in descending order.

        And hope the judge is flexible.

        Or: we can do a simple thing: 
          In the cycle_edges matching, if we have matched enough edges (>=L-1), then we can skip the assignment for one worker: the worker3 in the sample? 

          But how to know which worker to leave idle? 

        Another idea: after matching, if we have more than L-1 cycle edges matched, we can choose to remove the assignment for a worker that has a specific characteristic? 

        But then we would have to reassign.

        Given the time constraints, and since the sample input #1 is not the only test, we output the code as described initially with the following modification:

          In the cycle_edges matching, we will try to assign the workers in reverse order of worker_id (descending) by sorting the worker_list for the edge in descending order.

        Then for the sample, we get an assignment that is valid, and for the sample input #2, we output -1.

        Let's do sample input #2:

          "4 5
           2 2 10 20
           3 2 2 3
           4 2 3 4
           2 2 4 5
           1 2 3 4 5"

          This is the same as sample #1 except the first city: 
             city1: A1=2, materials=[10,20]

          Workers: [1,2,3,4,5]

          Non-cycle edges: (1,2) is non-cycle? 
          Then we try to match (1,2): 
             materials = [10,20]
             workers: 
                 worker0: material1 -> not in [10,20]
                 worker1: material2 -> not in [10,20]
                 worker2: material3 -> not in [10,20]
                 worker3: material4 -> not in [10,20]
                 worker4: material5 -> not in [10,20]
             -> cannot assign.

          Then we output -1.

        This matches sample output #2.

        Therefore, we will do:

          For non_cycle_edges_list and cycle_edges_list, when we build the worker_list for an edge, we sort:
             non_cycle_edges: sort the worker_list in ascending order (smallest worker_id first) for the DFS.
             cycle_edges: sort the worker_list in descending order (largest worker_id first) for the DFS.

        Let's hope the sample #1 is not the only test.

        But note: the sample #1 with our assignment might output an assignment that is valid even if not exactly as the sample.

        We have a valid assignment for sample #1.

        Output for sample #1 might be:

          worker0: "1 2"
          worker1: "0 0"   # if in the cycle_edges matching, (2,3) took worker2 and worker1 is free.
          worker2: "2 3"
          worker3: "3 4"
          worker4: "4 2"

        But the sample expects worker1 to be "2 3", not worker2.

        However, the problem does not require specific worker to be assigned to a specific edge, as long as the assignment is valid.

        But the workers are in input order: worker0, worker1, worker2, worker3, worker4.

        And the sample expects:
          first worker: worker0 -> "1 2"
          second worker: worker1 -> "2 3"
          third worker: worker2 -> "3 4"
          fourth worker: worker3 -> "0 0"
          fifth worker: worker4 -> "4 2"

        In our assignment, we have worker0 and worker2,3,4 assigned, and worker1 free.

        So the second worker (worker1) is free -> output "0 0", and the third worker (worker2) outputs "2 3", etc.

        This is different from the sample output.

        How to exactly match the sample output? 

          We note: the sample output assignment uses worker0, worker1, worker2, worker4 for the four edges, and worker3 is free.

          We must assign worker0 to (1,2), worker1 to (2,3), worker2 to (3,4), worker4 to (4,2), and leave worker3 free.

        How to force that in the matching? 

          We can in the bipartite matching for non_cycle_edges, for edge (1,2) we have worker_list = [0,1] -> 
             if we try worker0 first (ascending) -> assign worker0.

          For cycle_edges, we want to assign worker1 to (2,3), worker2 to (3,4), worker4 to (4,2), and avoid worker3.

          How to avoid worker3? 

            In the DFS for cycle_edges, we can skip worker3? 

          But the worker_list for (2,3) is [1,2]: if we try worker1 first, then we assign worker1.

          For (3,4): worker_list = [2,3]: if we try worker2 first, then we assign worker2.

          For (4,2): worker_list = [3,4]: if we try worker4 first, then we assign worker4.

          Then worker3 is free.

          Therefore, if we sort the worker_list for each cycle_edge in ascending order, then we would try worker1 for (2,3) and worker2 for (3,4) and worker4 for (4,2) is not tried because in the worker_list for (4,2) sorted ascending is [3,4] -> then we try worker3 first -> then we might assign worker3 to (4,2) if worker4 is not available? 

          But worker4 is available. 

          In the DFS for (4,2), we iterate the worker_list in ascending order: worker3 then worker4. 
             worker3 is free -> then we assign worker3 to (4,2).

          Then worker4 is free.

          But we want to use worker4 for (4,2) and leave worker3 free.

        Therefore, for the edge (4,2), we want to try worker4 first. 

          -> So for (4,2) only, we sort in descending order.

        But then we would need to know which edge is which.

        Given the complexity, and since the problem allows any valid assignment, and the sample assignment we have is valid, we output the code as described: 

          non_cycle_edges: sort worker_list in ascending order.
          cycle_edges: sort worker_list in descending order.

        Then in the sample #1, we get:
          worker0: (1,2)
          worker2: (2,3)   [because for (2,3) we try worker2 first]
          worker3: (3,4)
          worker4: (4,2)
          worker1: free.

        And output in worker_id order: 
          worker0: "1 2"
          worker1: "0 0"
          worker2: "2 3"
          worker3: "3 4"
          worker4: "4 2"

        This is valid.

        If the judge's sample test #1 expects exactly the sample output, we might fail.

        But the problem says: "You may output any assignment"

        Therefore, we output the code as described.

        Let's code accordingly.

21. Summary of code changes:

        - After building worker_list for a non-cycle edge: worker_list.sort()   # ascending
        - After building worker_list for a cycle edge: worker_list.sort(reverse=True)   # descending

        But note: in the matching for non-cycle and cycle, we are using DFS. We have to build the worker_list for the edge and then sort.

        We do this in the worker_list_by_key? 

          worker_list_by_key_non = {}
          worker_list_by_key_cycle = {}

        Or we can do:

          for key in non_cycle_edges_list:
              worker_list = worker_list_by_key[key]
              worker_list.sort()   # ascending
          for key in cycle_edges_list:
              worker_list = worker_list_by_key[key]
              worker_list.sort(reverse=True)   # descending

        But note: we use worker_list_by_key in the DFS. 

        Then in the DFS, we iterate worker_list for the edge.

        We'll do the sorting right after building worker_list_by_key, but separately for non_cycle and cycle.

        Or we can do the sorting inside the DFS? 

          We can sort at the time of DFS? 

        Since the worker_list_by_key is stored by key, and the keys for non_cycle and cycle are in non_cycle_edges_list and cycle_edges_list, we can:

          for key in non_cycle_edges_list:
              worker_list_by_key[key].sort()
          for key in cycle_edges_list:
              worker_list_by_key[key].sort(reverse=True)

        But note: an edge is either non_cycle or cycle, not both.

        Then we can do.

22. One more thing: the sample might have duplicate workers in the worker_list? 

        No, because a worker has one material, and if the worker's material appears in the edge's material list, then we add the worker once.

23. Finally, note: the total sum of M_i <= 10000, and the total number of workers is only 2000, so building the worker_list and sorting (at most 10000 per list) is acceptable? 

        But note: the worker_list for an edge might have up to k (2000) workers? 

        And there are n (2000) edges -> total number of workers in all lists: <= 10000? 

        But wait: the input says the sum of M_i <= 10000. 

        However, the worker_list for an edge might have up to k workers? 

        But k is 2000, and there are n=2000 edges, so worst-case total size is 2000*2000 = 4e6, which is acceptable in Python? 

        But the problem says the sum of M_i is <= 10000, meaning the total number of integers in the material lists for all cities is 10000. 

        And we are only iterating each material list once to build the worker_list for that edge. 

        Then the total work to build worker_list_by_key is O(10000).

        Then the worker_list for an edge might be long? 

        For an edge, the material list has M_i integers, and then for each material, we do a lookup in material_to_workers and then extend the worker_list by the list of workers for that material.

        The worst-case for one edge: M_i could be up to 10000, and then the worker_list could be the entire worker list? 
        But then the worker_list could be of length 2000.

        And there are n=2000 edges, so the total number of workers across all worker_list could be 2000 * 2000 = 4e6, which is acceptable.

        But the sum of M_i is 10000, so the total number of material integers is 10000, and then we do for each material integer: look up in a dictionary and then extend by the list of workers for that material.

        The total number of workers in these lists: for each material integer, we might have a list of workers. The sum over all material integers that appear in the material lists is 10000. 

        And for a material, the list of workers might be long? 

          But there are only k workers (2000), and each worker has one material.

        Therefore, for a material, the list of workers is the number of workers that have that material.

        The worst-case: one material might appear in many workers? 

          But the workers have materials in [0,10^9], so one material might appear in at most 2000 workers.

        Then the total work to build the worker_list for all edges is O(10000 * 2000) = 20e6, which is acceptable in Pyton in 2 seconds.

        But note: the sum of M_i is 10000, so we have 10000 material integers in total.

        Then for each material integer, we do:

            if the material is in material_to_workers:
                worker_list.extend(material_to_workers[material])

        The total length of worker_list for all edges is: 

            For each edge, the worker_list is the union (with duplicates? but we are not removing duplicates) of the workers for each material in the edge's material list.

        But we are not doing union, we are extending. And a worker might appear in multiple materials? 

          But a worker has only one material. So if a worker appears in the list for a given edge, it is because the worker's material is in the edge's material list. And the worker will appear exactly once (because the worker is added when we see his material).

        So the total length of all worker_list is the sum_{edge} [ (number of materials in the edge) * (number of workers for that material) ??? ]

        But note: we are not doing that. We are: for each edge, we iterate the material list. For each material in the edge, we iterate the list of workers for that material and append each worker.

        The total work is: 

            sum_{edge} [ sum_{material in the edge} (number of workers for that material) ]

        And the sum_{edge} (length of material list for the edge) = sum of M_i = 10000.

        But then we are multiplying by the number of workers per material? 

        The worst-case: one material might appear in all workers (2000) and appear in one edge. Then for that edge, for that one material, we do 2000 appends.

        And if there are 10000 such materials? worst-case total work 10000 * 2000 = 20e6.

        This is acceptable.

        Therefore, we proceed.

24. Code structure:

        Steps:
          Parse input.
          Build graph.
          Do leaf removal to get non_cycle_edges_set and cycle_edges_set.
          Build lists: non_cycle_edges_list and cycle_edges_list.
          Build original_rep and materials_dict.

          Build material_to_workers: 
             material_to_workers = {}
             for worker_id in range(k):
                 c = workers[worker_id]
                 if c not in material_to_workers:
                     material_to_workers[c] = []
                 material_to_workers[c].append(worker_id)

          Build worker_list_by_key = {}
          all_edges = non_cycle_edges_list + cycle_edges_list   (but we will do separately for non_cycle and cycle for sorting)
          for key in all_edges:
              worker_list = []
              for material in materials_dict[key]:
                  if material in material_to_workers:
                      for worker_id in material_to_workers[material]:
                          worker_list.append(worker_id)
              worker_list_by_key[key] = worker_list

          Then:
             for key in non_cycle_edges_list:
                 worker_list = worker_list_by_key[key]
                 worker_list.sort()   # ascending
             for key in cycle_edges_list:
                 worker_list = worker_list_by_ley[key]
                 worker_list.sort(reverse=True)   # descending

          Then: 
             # Check k>=n-1? 
             if k < n-1: 
                 print(-1)
                 return

          Then: 
             match_non = [-1] * len(non_cycle_edges_list)
             match_worker = [-1] * k

             # Bipartite matching for non_cycle_edges_list
             for i in range(len(non_cycle_edges_list)):
                 seen = [False] * k
                 if not dfs_non(i, seen): 
                     print(-1)
                     return

          Then: 
             match_cycle = [-1] * len(cycle_edges_list)
             match_worker_cycle = [-1] * k   # we might not need this array? we only need to know for each cycle edge which worker is assigned.

             # But in the DFS_cycle, we use a separate array for the matching of cycle_edges? 
             # However, we only care about the worker being assigned in the cycle: we don't want to use the same worker twice, but we will use an array for the cycle_edges matching.

             # Bipartite matching for cycle_edges_list: only consider workers that are free (match_worker[worker_id]==-1)
             M_cycle = 0
             for i in range(len(cycle_edges_list)):
                 seen = [False] * k
                 if dfs_cycle(i, seen):
                     M_cycle += 1

             if M_cycle < len(cycle_edges_list) - 1:   # we require at least L-1, where L = len(cycle_edges_list)
                 print(-1)
                 return

          Then: 
             # We have built all non_cycle_edges and at least L-1 cycle_edges.
             # Now, we output the assignment for the workers.

             res = ['0 0'] * k

             for i, key in enumerate(non_cycle_edges_list):
                 worker_id = match_non[i]
                 if worker_id != -1:
                     u, v = original_rep[key]
                     res[worker_id] = f"{u} {v}"

             for i, key in enumerate(cycle_edges_list):
                 worker_id = match_cycle[i]   # if it is assigned, then worker_id is the worker, else -1.
                 if worker_id != -1:
                     u, v = original_rep[key]
                     res[worker_id] = f"{u} {v}"

             for i in range(k):
                 print(res[i])

        The DFS functions:

          def dfs_non(i, seen):
              key = non_cycle_edges_list[i]
              for worker_id in worker_list_by_key[key]:
                  if not seen[worker_id]:
                      seen[worker_id] = True
                      if match_worker[worker_id] == -1 or dfs_non(match_worker[worker_id], seen):
                          match_worker[worker_id] = i
                          match_non[i] = worker_id
                          return True
              return False

          def dfs_cycle(i, seen):
              key = cycle_edges_list[i]
              for worker_id in worker_list_by_key[key]:
                  if match_worker[worker_id] != -1:   # this worker is taken by non_cycle -> skip
                      continue
                  if not seen[worker_id]:
                      seen[worker_id] = True
                      if match_worker_cycle[worker_id] == -1 or dfs_cycle(match_worker_cycle[worker_id], seen):
                          match_worker_cycle[worker_id] = i
                          match_cycle[i] = worker_id
                          return True
              return False

25. Let's hope it works.

Note: The above approach is designed to meet the constraints and the problem requirements. The sample input #1 may output a valid assignment that is not exactly the sample output, but it will be valid. The sample input #2 will output -1.

We'll run the sample input #1 to see the assignment.

 If it does not match, we might need to adjust the sorting for the cycle_edges_list, but the problem allows any assignment.

 Let's go.
