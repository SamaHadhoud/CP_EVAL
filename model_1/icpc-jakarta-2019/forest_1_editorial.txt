### Approach
To solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a node in a given tree such that removing it results in a forest where all the resulting trees are identical (isomorphic). If such a node exists, we should return the maximum number of identical trees obtained by removing one such node; otherwise, return -1.

#### Key Insights
1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires finding a node (called a good cutting point) whose removal splits the tree into two or more disconnected subtrees that are all pairwise identical (isomorphic). The number of subtrees is equal to the degree of the node (since each subtree is connected to the node via an edge).
2. **Constraints**: The candidate node must have a degree of at least 2, and the total number of nodes in the tree (excluding the candidate node) must be divisible by the degree of the node. This ensures that all resulting subtrees have the same number of nodes.
3. **Tree Isomorphism**: After verifying the size condition, we need to check if all the resulting subtrees are identical. This involves:
   - **Finding Centers**: For each subtree, identify its center(s) (either 1 or 2 nodes) which help in determining a canonical representation of the tree.
   - **Tree Hashing**: Compute a hash for each subtree rooted at its center(s). The canonical hash of the subtree is the minimum of the hashes when rooted at each center (to handle symmetric cases).

#### Algorithm Selection
1. **Divisor Check**: For each node, check if its degree is a divisor of \(N-1\) (where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the tree) and is at least 2.
2. **Size Validation**: For each candidate node, remove it and verify that all resulting subtrees have the same size \((N-1)/k\) (where \(k\) is the degree of the node).
3. **Isomorphism Check**: For each subtree:
   - **Center Identification**: Use a leaf removal algorithm to find the center(s) of the subtree.
   - **Tree Hashing**: Compute a hash for the subtree by traversing it in BFS order, combining child hashes in a sorted manner to ensure the hash is invariant under reordering of children.
4. **Result Compilation**: If all subtrees of a candidate node have the same canonical hash, update the answer to the maximum such degree encountered.

#### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: For each node, we perform a BFS to partition the tree (\(O(N)\)). For each resulting subtree, center identification and tree hashing also take linear time (\(O(s)\) for a subtree of size \(s\)). Since the sum of all subtree sizes is \(O(N)\), the total time per candidate node is \(O(N)\). With up to \(O(\sqrt{N})\) candidate nodes (due to divisor constraints), the overall complexity is \(O(N^{3/2})\).
- **Space Complexity**: The space required is \(O(N)\) to store the tree and intermediate data structures during BFS and hashing.

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a tree represented as an adjacency list.
2. **Divisor Calculation**: For each node, we check if its degree is a divisor of \(N-1\) (where \(N\) is the number of nodes) and is at least 2.
3. **Component Extraction**: For each candidate node, we perform BFS to extract the connected components formed by its removal.
4. **Size Validation**: We verify that all extracted components have the same size \((N-1)/k\).
5. **Tree Hashing**: For each component:
   - **Center Identification**: Using leaf removal to find the center(s) of the component.
   - **Hash Computation**: Compute a canonical hash by traversing the component in BFS order, combining child hashes in sorted order to ensure invariance under child reordering.
6. **Result Compilation**: If all components of a candidate node have the same hash, update the answer to the maximum such degree encountered. If no such node exists, return -1. 

This approach efficiently checks each candidate node and leverages tree hashing to verify isomorphism, ensuring correctness within feasible computational limits.
