### Problem Analysis
The problem involves finding the largest possible rectangular building size (A × B) such that two identical buildings of this size can be constructed on available lands. The buildings can be placed in two configurations:
1. **Two buildings on one land**: Both buildings must fit on a single land with the same orientation, satisfying one of four conditions related to doubling one dimension of the building.
2. **One building per land**: Each building is placed on a separate land (not necessarily the same orientation), fitting within the land's dimensions in either orientation.

The goal is to maximize the area of one building (A × B), considering both configurations.

### Key Insight
- **Normalization**: For each land, represent its dimensions as (long_i, short_i), where long_i = max(L_i, W_i) and short_i = min(L_i, W_i). This simplifies placement conditions since the building can be rotated.
- **Single Land Option (Option 1)**: The maximum building area achievable on a single land i is (long_i × short_i) / 2. This is derived by optimally using the land's dimensions (e.g., doubling one building dimension to cover half the land's longer side).
- **Two Lands Option (Option 2)**: For two different lands i and j, the building must satisfy:
  - The longer building side ≤ min(long_i, long_j).
  - The shorter building side ≤ min(short_i, short_j).
  The maximum area is min(long_i, long_j) × min(long_i, long_j, short_i, short_j).

### Algorithm Selection
1. **Compute Option 1**: For each land, calculate (long_i × short_i) and track the maximum value (candidate_one).
2. **Compute Option 2**:
   - **Sort Lands**: Sort lands by long_i in descending order to efficiently process pairs.
   - **Sweep with Tracking**: Traverse the sorted list, maintaining the maximum short_i encountered (max_short). For each land, compute the best candidate area with previously processed lands (which have long_j ≥ current long_i) using:
     - candidate_ij = long_i × min(long_i, min(short_i, max_short))
   - Track the maximum candidate_ij (candidate_two) across all pairs.
3. **Determine Result**: Compare candidate_one and 2 × candidate_two:
   - If candidate_one ≥ 2 × candidate_two, the result is candidate_one / 2 (output as integer.0 or half-integer.5).
   - Otherwise, the result is candidate_two (output as integer.0).

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(N log N) due to sorting the lands. The subsequent sweep is O(N).
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) for storing land dimensions.

### Solution Code
```python
import sys

def main():
    data = sys.stdin.read().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    lands = []
    for i in range(n):
        L = int(data[1+2*i])
        W = int(data[1+2*i+1])
        long_i = max(L, W)
        short_i = min(L, W)
        lands.append((long_i, short_i))
    
    candidate_one = 0
    for (long_i, short_i) in lands:
        product = long_i * short_i
        if product > candidate_one:
            candidate_one = product
            
    lands.sort(key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)
    
    candidate_two = 0
    max_short = 0
    for (long_i, short_i) in lands:
        if max_short > 0:
            temp = min(short_i, max_short)
            T = min(long_i, temp)
            candidate_ij = long_i * T
            if candidate_ij > candidate_two:
                candidate_two = candidate_ij
        if short_i > max_short:
            max_short = short_i
            
    if candidate_one >= 2 * candidate_two:
        half = candidate_one // 2
        if candidate_one % 2 == 0:
            print(f"{half}.0")
        else:
            print(f"{half}.5")
    else:
        print(f"{candidate_two}.0")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into land dimensions, normalized to (long_i, short_i) for easier processing.
2. **Option 1 Calculation**: The maximum product (long_i × short_i) across all lands is stored as candidate_one. This represents the largest building area possible on a single land (when divided by 2).
3. **Option 2 Calculation**:
   - **Sorting**: Lands are sorted by long_i in descending order to process larger lands first.
   - **Sweeping**: For each land, the algorithm checks all previously processed lands (with long_j ≥ current long_i) to compute the best possible building area (candidate_ij). The maximum short_i encountered (max_short) is maintained to efficiently compute constraints.
4. **Result Determination**: The result is derived by comparing candidate_one and 2 × candidate_two:
   - If candidate_one is larger, it is halved and printed as either an integer (with ".0") or a half-integer (with ".5").
   - Otherwise, candidate_two is printed as an integer (with ".0").

This approach efficiently handles both placement options and leverages sorting and sweeping to maximize the building area within feasible constraints.
