To solve this problem, we need to count the number of feasible deployment plans for cleaning robots in a tree-structured town. The deployment must satisfy two main conditions: each robot's task must form a path in the tree, and the plan must be irreducible, meaning no two robots' tasks can be combined into a single longer path. 

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves partitioning a tree into disjoint paths such that the union of all paths covers all vertices, and no two paths can be merged into a single path. The key insight is that two paths can be merged if they are connected by an edge and both endpoints of the connecting edge are endpoints of their respective paths. To prevent this, for any edge connecting two paths, at least one endpoint must not be an endpoint of its path.

2. **Dynamic Programming on Trees**: We use a tree-based dynamic programming approach where each node maintains three states:
   - `dp[u][0]`: Number of ways where there is no open path ending at node `u`.
   - `dp[u][1]`: Number of ways where there is exactly one open path ending at node `u`.
   - `dp[u][2]`: Number of ways where there are exactly two open paths meeting at node `u`.

3. **State Transitions**: For each node `u` and its child `v`, we consider whether to connect the edge `(u, v)` to extend an open path or leave it as a cut edge. The transitions ensure that if the edge is cut, at least one endpoint (either `u` or `v`) is not an open path endpoint to maintain irreducibility.

4. **Recurrence Relations**:
   - **State 0 (`dp[u][0]`)**: Combines scenarios where the edge is not connected or connected in a way that closes all paths.
   - **State 1 (`dp[u][1]`)**: Combines scenarios where the edge is connected to extend an open path or a new path starts at `u`.
   - **State 2 (`dp[u][2]`)**: Combines scenarios where two open paths meet at `u`.

5. **Final Calculation**: The answer is derived from the root node's states, summing `dp[0][0]` and `dp[0][1]`, representing all valid configurations where paths are either closed or have one open end that can be closed at the root.

### Solution Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
const int MOD = 1000000007;
const int MAXN = 100000;

vector<int> graph[MAXN + 10];
long long dp[MAXN + 10][3];

void dfs(int u, int parent) {
    dp[u][0] = 1;
    dp[u][1] = 0;
    dp[u][2] = 0;
    for (int v : graph[u]) {
        if (v == parent) continue;
        dfs(v, u);
        long long ways0 = dp[v][0];
        long long ways1 = dp[v][1];
        long long ways2 = dp[v][2];

        long long ndp0 = (dp[u][0] * (2 * ways0 + 2 * ways1 + ways2) % MOD
                      + (dp[u][1] * (ways0 + ways1) % MOD)
                      + (dp[u][2] * (ways0 + ways1) % MOD;
        ndp0 %= MOD;

        long long ndp1 = (dp[u][0] * (ways0 + ways1) % MOD)
                      + (dp[u][1] * ways0 % MOD);
        ndp1 %= MOD;

        long long ndp2 = (dp[u][0] * (ways0 + ways1) % MOD)
                      + (dp[u][2] * ways0 % MOD);
        ndp2 %= MOD;

        dp[u][0] = ndp0;
        dp[u][1] = ndp1;
        dp[u][2] = ndp2;
    }
}

int main() {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        int u, v;
        scanf("%d %d", &u, &v);
        u--; v--;
        graph[u].push_back(v);
        graph[v].push_back(u);
    }
    dfs(0, -1);
    long long ans = (dp[0][0] + dp[0][1]) % MOD;
    printf("%lld\n", ans);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: The tree is built using an adjacency list. The DP array is initialized to store counts of valid path partitions for each node.
2. **DFS Traversal**: For each node during DFS, we initialize its states. The initial state `dp[u][0] = 1` represents the singleton path.
3. **State Transitions**: For each child `v` of `u`, we update the states:
   - **State 0**: Combines scenarios where paths are closed or extended without creating open ends.
   - **State 1**: Combines scenarios where one open path is extended or a new path starts.
   - **State 2**: Combines scenarios where two open paths meet at `u`.
4. **Result Calculation**: The answer is the sum of `dp[0][0]` and `dp[0][1]`, representing all valid configurations where paths are either closed or have one open end that is closed at the root. The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

This approach efficiently counts all valid irreducible partitions by leveraging dynamic programming on trees, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.
