### Approach
The problem requires counting the number of ways to partition a tree into disjoint paths such that the partition is irreducible. An irreducible partition means that no two distinct paths can be combined to form a single longer path. The key observation is that two paths can be combined if they are connected by an edge and both endpoints of the connecting edge are endpoints of their respective paths. To avoid this, for any edge connecting two different paths, at least one of the endpoints must not be an endpoint of its path.

We use dynamic programming (DP) on trees to solve this problem. The DP state for each node \( u \) is defined as follows:
- \( dp[u][0] \): Number of ways where there is no open path ending at \( u \) (all paths are closed within the subtree).
- \( dp[u][1] \): Number of ways where there is exactly one open path ending at \( u \) (the path can be extended to the parent of \( u \)).
- \( dp[u][2] \): Number of ways where there are exactly two open paths meeting at \( u \) (forming an internal node, and these paths are closed within the subtree).

The recurrence relations for these states are derived by considering the contributions from each child node \( v \) of \( u \). The transitions account for whether the edge between \( u \) and \( v \) is used to connect paths (thereby extending an open path) or left as a cut edge (ensuring at least one endpoint is not an open path endpoint to satisfy irreducibility).

### Solution Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
const int MOD = 1000000007;
const int MAXN = 100000;

vector<int> graph[MAXN + 10];
long long dp[MAXN + 10][3];

void dfs(int u, int parent) {
    dp[u][0] = 1;
    dp[u][1] = 0;
    dp[u][2] = 0;
    for (int v : graph[u]) {
        if (v == parent) continue;
        dfs(v, u);
        long long ways0 = dp[v][0];
        long long ways1 = dp[v][1];
        long long ways2 = dp[v][2];

        long long ndp0 = (dp[u][0] * (2 * ways0 + 2 * ways1 + ways2) % MOD
                      + (dp[u][1] * (ways0 + ways1) % MOD)
                      + (dp[u][2] * (ways0 + ways1) % MOD);
        ndp0 %= MOD;

        long long ndp1 = (dp[u][0] * (ways0 + ways1) % MOD)
                      + (dp[u][1] * ways0 % MOD);
        ndp1 %= MOD;

        long long ndp2 = (dp[u][0] * (ways0 + ways1) % MOD)
                      + (dp[u][2] * ways0 % MOD);
        ndp2 %= MOD;

        dp[u][0] = ndp0;
        dp[u][1] = ndp1;
        dp[u][2] = ndp2;
    }
}

int main() {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        int u, v;
        scanf("%d %d", &u, &v);
        u--; v--;
        graph[u].push_back(v);
        graph[v].push_back(u);
    }
    dfs(0, -1);
    long long ans = (dp[0][0] + dp[0][1]) % MOD;
    printf("%lld\n", ans);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: The tree is represented as an adjacency list. The DP array is initialized to store counts of valid path partitions for each node.
2. **DFS Traversal**: For each node \( u \) during DFS, we initialize \( dp[u][0] = 1 \) (the singleton path) and other states to zero.
3. **State Transitions**:
   - For each child \( v \) of \( u \), we consider whether to connect the edge \( (u, v) \) to extend an open path or leave it as a cut edge.
   - The transitions ensure that if an edge is a cut edge, at least one endpoint is not an open path endpoint to maintain irreducibility.
   - The recurrence relations aggregate counts from child subtrees while considering different cases of open and closed paths.
4. **Result Calculation**: The answer for the entire tree is the sum of \( dp[0][0] \) (closed paths) and \( dp[0][1] \) (one open path that can be closed at the root) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

This approach efficiently counts all valid irreducible partitions by leveraging tree DP and careful state management to handle the constraints and requirements. The complexity is linear in the number of nodes, making it suitable for large trees.
