 We are going to follow the editorial guidelines.

 Steps:
 1. Read the input and build the graph.
 2. Precompute the divisors of (n-1) that are at least 2? Actually, for a candidate node u, we require that the degree k of u divides (n-1) and k>=2.
 3. We iterate over each node u as candidate. Conditions:
    - deg[u] must be at least 2 and (n-1) % deg[u] == 0.
    - The removal of u should yield deg[u] connected components (each connected to u by an edge) and each must have the same size: s = (n-1) // deg[u].
 4. For each candidate u, we do:
    a. Mark u as visited and then traverse each neighbor to form connected components (by BFS/DFS without u).
    b. Check that each component has size s. If not, skip.
    c. For each component, we need to compute a canonical representation (hash) that is invariant under isomorphism. Steps for a component:
        - Find the center(s) of the component (by peeling leaves until 1 or 2 nodes remain).
        - For each center, root the tree at the center and compute a hash. The canonical hash for the component is the minimum of the hashes of the centers (if two centers, then we have two hashes and we take min to represent the whole tree).
        - How to compute hash for a rooted tree? We do a BFS from the root (in reverse order, from leaves to root) and for each node, we sort the hashes of its children (so that the order of children doesn't matter) and then combine them to form the parent's hash.

 5. Then, we check if all the components have the same canonical hash. If yes, then candidate u is a good cutting point and the number of components is deg[u]. We want the maximum deg[u] (which is the maximum number of trees) for which this holds.

 6. If we find at least one candidate, output the maximum deg[u] (which is the number of trees). Otherwise, output -1.

 Important: We note that the entire tree has n nodes. Removing u gives deg[u] components, each of size s = (n-1)//deg[u].

 However, note: the problem asks for the maximum number of disconnected trees that can be obtained by removing exactly one good cutting point. So we are to maximize the number of trees (which is the degree of the node). Therefore, we iterate and record the maximum degree for which the condition holds.

 Implementation details for hashing:
   We use two mod bases to avoid collisions? (double hashing) and a base (like 131).

   For a tree rooted at a node, we can do:
      hash(node) = (1 + sum_{child in sorted_children} (hash(child) * base^1 + ... ) ) 
   but note: we need to combine the children in a way that the order of children does not matter.

   How: 
      - For each node, collect the hashes of its children and sort them (by the hash tuple?).
      - Then, combine the sorted child hashes: 
          h1 = 1
          for each child_hash in sorted_child_hashes:
              h1 = (h1 * base + child_hash[0]) % mod1
              h2 = (h2 * base + child_hash[1]) % mod2   [if we use two mods]

   However, we are going to use two mods? The editorial uses two mods.

   Actually, we can compute two hashes for each node: one for mod1 and one for mod2.

   Steps for a rooted tree (from leaves to root):
      - We do a BFS (or DFS) in reverse order (from the root downward, but then process from leaves up). Actually, we can do a topological order from leaves to root.

   We can do:
        order = BFS starting from the root? Actually, we can do a BFS that collects nodes from the root and then process in reverse BFS order.

        We'll build the tree structure for the component: we know the nodes and edges. Then, from the root, we can do a BFS to assign parent and children.

        Steps for a center in the component:
          - Build the tree: from the center, we do BFS to assign children (only within the component, and excluding u and the rest of the tree? We already have the component set).

        Then, we traverse the nodes in reverse BFS order (i.e., from the leaves to the root) to compute the hash.

   We'll have two arrays: h1 and h2 (for mod1 and mod2) of size n (initialized to 1? or 0?).

        For each node in reverse order (starting from leaves and going up to the center):
            child_hashes = []
            for each child c of node:
                child_hashes.append( (h1[c], h2[c]) )
            sort child_hashes by the tuple (h1, h2) so that the order is canonical.

            Then, set h1[node] = 1
            Then, for each (ch1, ch2) in child_hashes:
                h1[node] = (h1[node] * base + ch1) % mod1
                h2[node] = (h2[node] * base + ch2) % mod2

        But note: we start with 1? Then we incorporate the children. Alternatively, we can start with 0? However, we want leaves to have a value? For a leaf, the list of children is empty -> then h1[node] becomes 1? Actually, we can set base value as 1. Then for a leaf: 
            h1 = 1, h2 = 1.

        Then for a node with one child: 
            child_hashes = [ (1,1) ]
            Then: h1 = (1 * base + 1) % mod1

        This is acceptable.

   Then the root's hash is (h1[root], h2[root]).

 7. For a component with two centers? Then we have two trees: one rooted at each center. Then we take the minimum of the two hashes (by tuple: first h1 then h2) to be the canonical representation of the entire tree.

 8. Then, we compare the canonical hashes of all components: if they are all the same, then candidate u is good, and we update ans = max(ans, deg[u])

 9. Note: We must reset the visited array for each candidate? Actually, we can do without a global visited if we do for each candidate: we mark u as visited and then traverse its neighbors. But note: the entire graph is a tree. However, we are going to do BFS for each candidate? That might be O(n) per candidate. But note: the total n is 4000, and the candidate nodes must satisfy that deg[u] is a divisor of (n-1) and at least 2. The number of divisors of (n-1) is O(sqrt(n)), so the total candidate nodes are at most O(sqrt(n))? Actually, the divisors condition is on the degree, but the degree of a node can be any value from 1 to n-1. However, the condition (n-1) % deg[u] == 0 restricts the degrees to the divisors of (n-1). The number of divisors of (n-1) is about O(sqrt(n)), so the total candidate nodes we consider is at most O(sqrt(n)) * O(n) for the BFS? Actually, we are iterating over each node u, but we break early if the divisor condition fails. The total candidate nodes that pass the divisor condition is at most the number of divisors? Actually, the divisors are fixed for the entire tree (n-1). So we precomputed the divisors. Then we only check nodes u that have deg[u] in the divisors. But note: the divisors we precomputed are for (n-1) and we have k=deg[u] must be in divisors. However, the divisors we precomputed are from 2 to n-1? Actually, we precomputed divisors for total = n-1.

    Precomputation: divisors = [d for d in range(2, n) if total % d == 0]

    Then for a node u, we check if deg[u] in divisors? Actually, we can do:

        if deg[u] >= 2 and (n-1) % deg[u] == 0:

    We don't need to precompute divisors per node, but we did precompute the list of divisors? Actually, we can avoid precomputation and just check modulo.

 10. Complexity: 
        We iterate over each node u: there are n nodes. For each candidate (that satisfies the divisor condition) we do:
            - BFS to split the graph: O(n)
            - For each component: 
                * Find centers: O(size of component) -> total over all components: O(n)
                * For each center: build a BFS tree and then compute the hash: O(size of component). Since the total size of all components is n-1, and we do at most 2 centers per component (so at most 2 * deg[u] trees? but each component is processed twice at worst? Actually, each component is processed once per center, and there are at most two centers per component. And the total size of all components is n-1. So the total work per candidate is O(n). 

        And the number of candidate u is at most the number of divisors of (n-1)? Actually, we iterate over all nodes u, but we break early for non-candidates. The worst-case: the divisors of n-1 are about O(sqrt(n)), but note: the degree of a node must be one of the divisors. How many nodes have a degree that is a divisor of (n-1)? The divisors are fixed (say D). Then the number of candidate nodes we do the BFS and hashing for is at most O(D). Since D is O(sqrt(n)), and n<=4000, then sqrt(4000) is about 63. So worst-case we do 63 * O(n) = 63 * 4000 = 252000, which is acceptable.

 11. However, worst-case n=4000, and the number of divisors of 3999? The divisors of 3999: 3999 = 3 * 31 * 43 -> divisors: 1, 3, 31, 43, 93, 129, 1333, 3999 -> 8 divisors. So the candidate nodes are at most 8? Actually, we require at least 2, so we skip 1. Then 8 divisors. And the number of nodes that have a degree that is one of these divisors? It might be more than 8? For example, if there are 100 nodes with degree 3? Then we do 100 * O(n) = 100 * 4000 = 400000, which is acceptable.

    Actually, worst-case the divisor condition: the divisors of n-1 (which is 3999) are 8, but the number of nodes that have a degree in {3,31,43,93,129,1333,3999}? The degree cannot be 3999 because n=4000, then the maximum degree is 3999? Actually, the maximum degree is 3999? But the tree has 3999 edges, so a node can have at most 3999 edges. But in reality, 3999 is the entire rest? So yes, it's possible? But then the component size s = (n-1) / k = 3999 / 3999 = 1. Then each component is a single node. Then all components are trivially identical. So we have to handle that.

    Actually, the problem: for k=3999, the removal of the center node gives 3999 components each of 1 node. They are all identical. Then the answer for that candidate is 3999. Then we output 3999? But the problem says "maximum number of disconnected trees", so we want the maximum k? Then we take max over candidate u.

    However, note: the problem says: "output the maximum number of disconnected trees that can be obtained by removing exactly one good cutting point". So if we have two candidates: one gives 2 trees, and one gives 3999 trees, we output 3999.

 12. Implementation for centers:

        For a component (a tree) with n_nodes = s:
            We want to find the center(s). We can do by peeling leaves until 1 or 2 nodes remain.

            Steps:
                deg_temp: an array for the degree in the component (only edges within the component). But note: the component is a tree? Actually, it is a connected component of the original tree without u, so it is a tree.

                We start by finding all leaves (degree 1) in the component.

                Then, we peel one layer at a time until we have 1 or 2 nodes.

        How to build the degree for the component? We can create a subgraph for the component? But we have the entire graph and we know the set of nodes.

            We can compute the degree of each node in the component: 
                For each node in the component, we count the neighbors that are also in the component.

        Then we simulate:

            leaves = deque()
            for each node in the component: 
                if deg_temp[node] == 1:
                    leaves.append(node)

            total_nodes = len(comp)
            while total_nodes > 2:
                new_leaves = deque()
                for _ in range(len(leaves)):
                    node = leaves.popleft()
                    total_nodes -= 1
                    for neighbor in graph[node]:
                        if neighbor in comp and deg_temp[neighbor] > 1:
                            deg_temp[neighbor] -= 1
                            if deg_temp[neighbor] == 1:
                                leaves.append(neighbor)
                leaves = new_leaves   # Actually, we are reusing the same queue? We can just use one queue and process all leaves at the current level.

            Then the centers are the remaining nodes in the leaves.

 13. Then, for each center, we build the tree rooted at that center? How?

        We do a BFS starting from the center (only within the component). Then we assign parent and children.

        Then we compute the hash in reverse BFS order (from the leaves to the center).

 14. We must be cautious: the entire graph is stored as an array of lists. We have the global graph. We have the set comp. So for a node in comp, we consider only neighbors that are in comp.

 15. Steps for the entire algorithm:

        n = int(input)
        Build graph: n nodes, n-1 edges.

        deg = [len(graph[i]) for i in range(n)]

        ans = -1

        for u in range(n):
            k = deg[u]
            if k < 2: 
                continue
            if (n-1) % k != 0:
                continue

            s = (n-1) // k   # size of each component

            # Do BFS starting from the neighbors of u to form components
            visited = [False] * n
            visited[u] = True
            comps = []   # list of sets of nodes for each component
            for v in graph[u]:
                if not visited[v]:
                    # BFS starting from v, without u
                    comp_set = set()
                    queue = deque([v])
                    visited[v] = True
                    comp_set.add(v)
                    while queue:
                        node = queue.popleft()
                        for neighbor in graph[node]:
                            if not visited[neighbor] and neighbor != u:
                                visited[neighbor] = True
                                comp_set.add(neighbor)
                                queue.append(neighbor)
                    comps.append(comp_set)

            if len(comps) != k:   # should be k components
                continue

            # Check each component has size s?
            valid_size = True
            for comp_set in comps:
                if len(comp_set) != s:
                    valid_size = False
                    break

            if not valid_size:
                continue

            # Now, for each component, compute its canonical hash
            comp_hashes = []   # list of canonical hashes for each component

            for comp_set in comps:

                            deg_comp[node] += 1

                # Find centers by peeling leaves
                leaves = deque()
                # We need a copy of deg_comp because we will modify it
                deg_temp = deg_comp[:]   # or we can use a list copy
                for node in comp_set:

                        # But note: we have already set to 1. Then for each child, we update.
                        for a, b in child_hashes:
                            h1[node] = (h1[node] * base + a) % mod1
                            h2[node] = (h2[node] * base + b) % mod2

                    center_hashes.append( (h1[center], h2[center]) )

                # Now, the canonical hash for the entire component is the min of center_hashes (if two, we compare the two tuples and take the smaller one)
                comp_hash = min(center_hashes)   # because min of tuples: compares first element, then second.
                comp_hashes.append(comp_hash)

                    same = False
                    break

            if same:
                if k > ans:
                    ans = k

        # After iterating over all nodes u
        if ans == -1:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(ans)

 16. However, note: the component might be of size 1. Then the center peeling: 
        total_nodes=1: then we never enter the while loop? Then leaves is initially: we add the node? But initially, we check for deg_temp[node] == 1? 
        For a single node: deg_temp[node] = 0? because it has no edge? But wait: the component is a single node. Then we did: 
            for node in comp_set: 
                for neighbor in graph[node]: 
                    if neighbor in comp_set: ... 
            Then comp_set has only the node, and the neighbors of the node: but if the node was connected to u? Then in the component, it has no edge? Because we removed u. So the node is isolated: deg_comp[node] = 0.

        Then we skip the leaves (because condition is deg_temp[node]==1). Then the leaves queue is empty. Then the while condition: current=1>2? false. Then centers = leaves -> empty? 

        We must handle the case s=1.

        How? 
            For a single node: we can consider the center as the node itself. But then we don't have any leaves? Then we can build the tree: 
                The BFS: 
                    start from center -> one node. Then the children_arr[center] is empty. Then we set h1[center]=1, h2[center]=1.

            So we should add: if the component has only one node, then the centers list should be [node]? 

        Correction: we built deg_comp for the component: for a single node, it has 0 edges. Then we did not add it to leaves. Then centers = [] -> then we skip the center_hashes? 

        We must handle: if the component has one node, then the center is that node.

        How to fix the center finding? 

            We can note: if the component has one node, then we break the center finding and set the center as that node.

            Alternatively, we can note: if total_nodes==1, then the center is the only node.

        Actually, we started by building deg_comp. Then we collected leaves (deg_comp[node]==1). Then if the component has one node, then that node has deg_comp[node]=0, so not added. Then we have no leaves? Then the centers are not found.

        We can do: if we have no leaves and current>0, then the centers are all the nodes that remain? Actually, our center algorithm should account for that: the algorithm for center by peeling leaves until 1 or 2 nodes remain. But if we start with one node, we never peel, and that one node is the center.

        We can change: 
            centers = list(leaves)   -> if we have no leaves and the while loop broke because current<=2, but if current==1, then we have one center: the node that was never added as a leaf? How to capture it?

        Alternatively, we can do: 
            If the component has one node: then we know the center is that node.

            So we can check: if s == 1:
                centers = [list(comp_set)[0]]   # the only node.

            But then we have to do that for s>=2? 

        Actually, the algorithm for centers (by peeling leaves) works for trees with at least 2 nodes? 

        We can do: 
            if len(comp_set) == 1:
                centers = [next(iter(comp_set))]
            else:
                # do the peeling

        Alternatively, we can avoid that by noting that the peeling algorithm: 
            We start with leaves (deg_temp[node]==1). 
            Then we remove leaves and update the degrees. 
            Then if the tree has one node, we will have no leaves? Then we break and the center is the remaining node? But we didn't collect it.

        How to fix the peeling? 

            Actually, the algorithm: 
                leaves = deque( [all nodes with deg_temp[node]==1] )
                total_nodes = len(comp_set)
                while total_nodes > 2 and leaves:
                    ...   # but we break when total_nodes<=2, but if we have one node, we break and then we return the remaining nodes? 

            But the problem: the one node is never added to the leaves. So after peeling, the remaining nodes are not collected? 

            Actually, at the end, we have the leaves deque which at the last step we have the centers. But if we break the loop because total_nodes<=2, then the centers are the leaves we have? But if we break at total_nodes=1, then we have no leaves? 

        Therefore, we can modify: 
            We know that the centers are the nodes that remain. How to get them? 

            Alternatively, we can note: the centers are the nodes that have not been peeled? We can mark which nodes are peeled? 

            Actually, we don't need to: the algorithm by peeling leaves until total_nodes>2? Then the centers are the remaining nodes? How do we know the remaining nodes? 

            We can do: 
                centers = set(comp_set)   # initially, but then we remove leaves? We don't track.

        Instead, we do: 
            We start with all nodes. Then we peel leaves until we have 1 or 2 nodes. We can simulate without a queue of leaves? 

            Actually, the standard algorithm: 
                leaves = [all leaves initially]
                while total_nodes > 2:
                    remove the leaves, then update the degrees and collect the new leaves.

                Then the centers are the remaining leaves? Actually, the centers are the nodes that are left.

            How do we know which nodes are left? We are only removing the leaves. Then at the end, the leaves queue becomes the centers? But when we break the loop, the leaves queue contains the next layer of leaves? Actually, at the end of the while loop, the leaves queue contains the centers.

            But if we break because total_nodes<=2, then we have the centers. However, in the last iteration we remove a layer of leaves and then set leaves = new_leaves. Then we break. Then the centers are the leaves we have in the last new_leaves? 

            Actually, the algorithm: 
                leaves = deque(initial leaves)
                total_nodes = len(comp_set)
                while total_nodes > 2:
                    remove the current leaves (of size = len(leaves)) -> total_nodes -= len(leaves)
                    then collect the new leaves (which are the nodes that become leaves after removing the current leaves) -> leaves = new_leaves
                Then centers = leaves

            But if we break the loop when total_nodes<=2, then the centers are the leaves that we collected at the last iteration? 

            Example: 2 nodes: 
                Initially: two leaves? Then we enter the loop? 
                total_nodes=2, so condition: 2>2? false -> then we break, and centers = leaves (which has the two nodes). 

            Example: 1 node: 
                total_nodes=1: condition 1>2 -> false, then centers = leaves (which is empty). 

            So we must handle the 1 node separately.

        Therefore, we can do:

            if s == 1:
                # then we know the component has one node: 
                node0 = next(iter(comp_set))
                centers = [node0]
            else:
                # do the peeling algorithm as above

        But note: s = (n-1)//k. For k=n-1, then s=1. So we must handle s=1.

        Alternatively, we can note: after the peeling, if leaves is empty? then we take the entire comp_set? But that should not happen. Actually, if the tree has one node, then the deg_temp for that node is 0, so we didn't add it to leaves. Then we break and leaves is empty. Then we can do: 
            if not leaves:
                # then the centers should be the entire comp_set? But comp_set has one node? 
                centers = list(comp_set)

            But wait: what if the tree is disconnected? But the comp_set is connected. And we know it's a tree. Then if we have one node, then we have one node. If we have two nodes? Then we have two nodes connected by an edge? Then both nodes have degree 1? Then initially leaves = [both nodes]. Then we break because total_nodes=2? Then we set centers = leaves -> which is both nodes. Then we are fine.

        Actually, the peeling algorithm: 
            We start by putting all leaves (deg_temp=1). 
            Then we remove the leaves and update the degrees. 
            Then we break when total_nodes<=2.

            But if the tree has one node, then we never put that node in leaves? Then leaves is empty? Then we break? Then centers = leaves = [].

        Therefore, we can do: 
            if len(leaves) == 0 and total_nodes==1:
                # then the center is the only node? 
                # But we don't know which node? Actually, we have the comp_set, and it has one node. 
                centers = [next(iter(comp_set))]

            But note: our peeling algorithm doesn't remove the node? How do we know which node remains? 

        Actually, we can avoid the peeling for the one-node case: 
            if s == 1:
                centers = [next(iter(comp_set))]
            else:
                # do the peeling

        But what if s>=2? Then we do the peeling. 

        Alternatively, we can do: 
            if s == 1:
                centers = [list(comp_set)[0]]
            else:
                # do the peeling as above

        But note: the problem: the sample input 13 nodes: the components have 4 nodes? Then s= (13-1)//3 = 4.

 17. Let's test the one-node component:

        Then we set centers = [node0]. Then we build the tree: 
            BFS: [node0] -> then order = [node0]
            Then in reverse order: [node0] -> then we process node0: 
                children_arr[node0] is empty -> so we do nothing. 
                h1[node0] = 1, h2[node0]=1 -> so the hash is (1,1).

        Then we are done.

 18. We'll code accordingly.

 19. But note: the problem says: the tree has n nodes. The center algorithm we use is standard.

 20. We run the entire code on the sample input.

        Sample input: 
            13
            1 5
            1 7
            2 4
            2 8
            2 11
            3 12
            4 7
            4 12
            6 11
            7 13
            9 10
            9 12

        Candidate: node 4 (index 3, since 0-indexed) -> deg[3] = 3? 
            Check: (n-1)=12, 12%3==0 -> s=4.

        Then we form three components? 
            Component1: starting from neighbor 1 (node0: node0 is 0-indexed: node0=0) -> then we get {0, 4, 6, 12}? 
                But note: the edges: 
                    0: [4] (because edge 1-5: 0-indexed: 0-4) -> but also 0 is connected to 6? (edge 1-7: 0-6). Then also 6 is connected to 12 (edge 7-13: 6-12) -> but wait, 13 is 12? 
                Actually, the nodes: 
                    1 -> 0
                    5 -> 4
                    7 -> 6
                    13 -> 12
                Then the edges: 
                    (0,4) -> (0,4)
                    (0,6) -> (0,6)
                    (6,12) -> (6,12)  [because edge 7-13: 6-12]

                Then the component: 
                    nodes: {0,4,6,12}
                    edges: 0-4, 0-6, 6-12? -> then the tree: 
                        0 is connected to 4 and 6, then 6 connected to 12.

                Then the center? 
                    deg_temp: 
                        0: connected to 4 and 6 -> deg_temp[0]=2? 
                        4: only connected to 0 -> deg_temp[4]=1
                        6: connected to 0 and 12 -> deg_temp[6]=2
                        12: connected to 6 -> deg_temp[12]=1

                    Then leaves: [4,12]. Then we remove them: 
                        total_nodes=4 -> then we remove 2 leaves -> becomes 2 nodes: 0 and 6. 
                        Then we break. Then centers = [0,6]? 

                Then we root at 0 and at 6 and compute the hash.

            How about the other components? They are the same.

        But note: the sample figure: 
            Component A: {5,1,7,13} -> in 0-indexed: {4,0,6,12} -> same as above.

        Then for center 0: 
            Root at 0: 
                children: 4 and 6? 
                Then 6 has child 12.

            Then the tree: 
                root: 0
                children of 0: [4,6]
                then children of 6: [12]

            Then the reverse BFS order: [12, 6, 4, 0]? 
                Actually, BFS from 0: 
                    level0: [0]
                    level1: [4,6]
                    level2: [12]   (from 6)
                Then reverse: [12, 4, 6, 0]

            Then compute:
                h1[12] = 1 (leaf)
                h1[4] = 1 (leaf) -> then we set: 
                For node 6: 
                    child_hashes = [ (h1[12]=1, h2[12]=1) ]
                    Then: h1[6] = (1 * base + 1) % mod1
                For node 0: 
                    child_hashes = [ (h1[4]=1, ...), (h1[6]= (1*base+1)%mod1, ...) ] -> we sort by the tuple? 
                    First, (1,?) and (h1[6], h2[6]): we sort: (1, ...) and then (h1[6], ...) -> so we have two elements: [ (1, ...), (h1[6], ...) ]? 
                    But note: we have two children: 4 and 6. The hash for 4 is (1,1) and for 6 is (base+1, base+1). Then we sort: (1,1) comes first.

                    Then: 
                        h1[0] = 1
                        then * base + 1 -> (1 * base + 1) % mod1 = base+1
                        then * base + (base+1) -> (base+1)*base + (base+1) = base^2 + base + base+1 = base^2 + 2*base+1

            For the other center 6? 
                Root at 6: 
                    children: 0 and 12? 
                    Then 0 has children: 4 and ...? But wait: 
                        from 6: 
                            neighbors: 0 and 12? 
                        Then for 0: 
                            neighbors: 4 and 6 (but 6 is parent) so 0 has child 4? 
                        Then the tree: 
                            6: children: 0 and 12.
                            0: child: 4.

                Reverse BFS: 
                    level0: [6]
                    level1: [0,12]
                    level2: [4] 
                    reverse: [4, 0, 12, 6]

                Then: 
                    h1[4]=1
                    h1[12]=1
                    For node 0: 
                        child_hashes = [ (h1[4]=1, ...) ] -> so h1[0] = base+1
                    For node 12: leaf -> h1[12]=1
                    For node 6: 
                        child_hashes = [ (h1[0]=base+1, ...), (h1[12]=1, ...) ] -> we sort: (1, ...) then (base+1, ...) 
                        Then: 
                            h1[6] = 1 * base + 1 -> base+1, then * base + (base+1) -> (base+1)*base + (base+1) = base^2 + base + base+1 = base^2+2*base+1? 

                Actually, same as the other center? 

            But wait: the two trees are not isomorphic? Actually, they are the same tree? 

            However, note: the tree rooted at 0 and the tree rooted at 6 are different? But the entire tree is the same? And we are taking the minimum of the two center hashes? 

            The hash for center0: (base^2+2*base+1, ...) and center6: (base^2+2*base+1, ...) -> same? 

            Then we take min? They are the same? Then the canonical hash is that value.

        Then we do the same for the other two components? They have the same structure? 

        Then the three components have the same canonical hash? Then candidate u=3 (node4) is good and k=3. Then ans = max(-1, 3)=3.

 21. We'll run the sample input 2: 
        Input: 
            6
            1 2
            1 3
            2 4
            3 5
            3 6

        Then we check each node? 
            The center? node1 (index0) has deg=2 -> then (n-1)=5, 5%2 !=0 -> skip.
            node2 (index1): deg=2 -> 5%2 !=0 -> skip.
            node3 (index2): deg=2 -> skip.
            node4 (index3): deg=1 -> skip.
            node5 (index4): deg=1 -> skip.
            node6 (index5): deg=1 -> skip.

        Then output -1.

 22. We'll test one more: a star tree of 4 nodes: center connected to 3 leaves. Then n=4.

        Then candidate: center node (say node0) has deg=3 -> (n-1)=3, 3%3==0 -> s=1.

        Then the three components are each a single node. Then each component: 
            centers = [the node] -> hash = (1,1). Then all same. Then ans = 3.

        But the problem: the tree is a star. Then removing the center gives 3 leaves. Then they are identical? Yes.

        Then output 3.

 23. However, what if we have a tree that is a chain? 
        Example: 1-2-3-4 (4 nodes in a line). 
        Candidate nodes: 
            node1: deg=1 -> skip.
            node2: deg=2 -> (n-1)=3, 3%2 !=0 -> skip.
            node3: deg=1 -> skip.
            node4: deg=1 -> skip.

        Then output -1.

        But what about node2? Removing node2 gives two components: [1] and [3,4]? They are not identical? So skip -> correct.

 24. We'll code accordingly.

 25. One more: a tree with two nodes? But n>=3 per problem.

 26. We'll run the code with the provided examples.

 27. We use double mod: mod1 and mod2? 

 28. We set base=131.

 29. We note: the hashing method: 
        For a node with no children: 
            h1 = 1
            h2 = 1

        For a node with one child (with hash (a,b)): 
            h1 = (1 * base + a) % mod1
            h2 = (1 * base + b) % mod2

        For a node with two children: 
            We sort the child hashes (by the tuple (h1, h2)). 
            Then: 
                h1 = 1
                for child1: h1 = (1 * base + a1) % mod1
                for child2: h1 = ( (base + a1) * base + a2 ) % mod1 = (base^2 + a1*base + a2) % mod1

            But if the two children are identical? Then a1=a2 and b1=b2? Then it's symmetric.

 30. We hope that collisions are rare.

 31. We'll run the sample of the star tree of 4 nodes: 
        center: node0, leaves: 1,2,3.
        Removing center: three components of one node. Each: 
            center: the leaf -> hash (1,1). 
        Then same.

 32. We output 3.

 33. We'll run a tree of 7 nodes: 
        center node0 connected to 6 leaves? Then n=7, deg[0]=6 -> (7-1)=6, divisible -> s=1. Then we get 6 components of one node. Then same. Then output 6.

 34. But note: the problem says "maximum number of disconnected trees". So we output 6.

 35. However, what if we have two candidate nodes? We take the maximum degree? 
        Example: a tree that has two centers: 
            One center that gives 2 trees? 
            One center that gives 3 trees? 
        Then we output 3.

 36. We'll code accordingly.

 37. We note: the BFS for forming components: we start from the neighbors of u. But note: the graph is a tree, so each neighbor of u will form one component? 

 38. We must be cautious: if we remove u, then the graph breaks into exactly deg[u] components? Yes, because it's a tree.

 39. Therefore, we can skip the check of the number of components? But we did: 
        comps = [] 
        for each neighbor v of u: 
            if not visited[v]: 
                do BFS -> one component
        then if we get k components (k=deg[u]), we proceed.

        But note: the graph is a tree, so we will get exactly k components? 

        However, what if we have a neighbor that was visited? We mark u as visited and then we traverse neighbors. Since u is the only node that connects the components, then we will get k components? 

        So we can skip the check: if len(comps) != deg[u]: ...? Actually, we break the loop when we traverse all neighbors? Then it must be deg[u] components? 

        But we can leave it for safety.

 40. We run the code on the provided examples.

 41. We note: the sample input 13 nodes: the candidate node is 4 (0-indexed: node 3) -> then we form three components? 

        We must build the graph for the sample? 

        Let's map the input to 0-indexed:

        Edges:
            1 5 -> 0-4
            1 7 -> 0-6
            2 4 -> 1-3
            2 8 -> 1-7
            2 11 -> 1-10
            3 12 -> 2-11
            4 7 -> 3-6
            4 12 -> 3-11
            6 11 -> 6-10?  -> wait: 6: node6? 11: node10? 
            7 13 -> 6-12
            9 10 -> 8-9
            9 12 -> 8-11

        Then the graph for node3 (which is 4 in 1-indexed) has neighbors: 
            node1 (because edge 2-4: 1-3) -> neighbor index1
            node6 (edge 4-7: 3-6) -> neighbor index6
            node11 (edge 4-12: 3-11) -> neighbor index11

        Then we form three components:

            Component1: from node1 (index1) -> then BFS: 
                node1: connected to 3? (but 3 is u) -> skip. Then connected to 7 (index7) and 10 (index10) and 3? 
                Then from node1: we get: 
                    node1, then node7, node10? 
                Then from node7: connected to node3? skip. 
                Then from node10: connected to? 
                    edge 6-11: which is 6-10? no: 6 is node6, 10 is node10 -> but that edge is in the graph? 
                Then node10 is connected to node6? But node6 is in the next component? 

            Actually, we must build the entire graph? 

            We have the graph:

                node0: [4, 6]   -> because 1 connected to 5 and 7 -> 0: [4,6]
                node1: [3,7,10] -> because 2 connected to 4,8,11 -> 1: [3,7,10]
                node2: [11]      -> because 3 connected to 12 -> 2: [11]
                node3: [1,6,11]  -> because 4 connected to 2,7,12 -> 3: [1,6,11]   [this is node3: which is 4 in 1-indexed]
                node4: [0]       -> 5: node4
                node5: []? -> no, we have 13 nodes? 
                Actually, nodes: 0 to 12.

            Let me list the edges:

                0: [4,6]   -> 0-4, 0-6
                1: [3,7,10] -> 1-3,1-7,1-10
                2: [11]     -> 2-11
                3: [1,6,11] -> 3-1,3-6,3-11
                4: [0]      -> 4-0
                5: ? -> the input doesn't have node5? Actually, the input has 13 nodes: 1 to 13. Then we have nodes 0 to 12.

            Then:
                6: [0,3,10,12] -> because: 
                    edge 1-7: 0-6, 
                    edge 4-7: 3-6, 
                    edge 6-11: 6-10? -> but 6 is node6, 11 is node10? 
                    edge 7-13: 6-12? 
                Actually, edge "6 11" -> 6 is node6, 11 is node10? because 11 is the 10th node (0-indexed: 0->1, 1->2, ... 10->11, 11->12, 12->13). 
                Then edge "6 11": 6-10? 
                Then node6: [0,3,10,12]? 

                7: [1,?] -> edge 2-8: 1-7 -> then 7: [1]? and edge 4-7: 3-6? -> that's 3-6, so 7 is not involved? 
                Actually, we have edge "2 8": 1-7? because 8 is node7? 
                Then node7: [1]? 

                node8: [9,11] -> because edge 9-10: 8-9? and 9-12: 8-11? 
                node9: [8,10]? -> no, wait: 
                    edge "9 10": 9-10? -> 0-indexed: 8-9? 
                    edge "9 12": 9-12? -> 8-11? 
                Then node8: [9,11] -> 8: [8?] -> no: 
                    node8: index8: connected to 9 and 11? 
                node9: [8,10]? -> from edge 9-10: 8-9? -> then node9: [8]? 
                Actually, edge "9 10": 9-10 -> 0-indexed: 8-9? 
                    So node8: [9,11] 
                    node9: [8,10]? -> but wait: edge 9-10: 8-9? then node9: [8,?] -> and edge "6 11": 6-10? -> 10 is node9? 
                This is confusing.

            We'll map the input:

                node0: 1
                node1: 2
                node2: 3
                node3: 4
                node4: 5
                node5: 6   -> but the input doesn't have 6? 
                Actually, the input has 13 nodes: 1 to 13 -> then we have 0 to 12.

                Edges:

                  1 5: 0-4
                  1 7: 0-6
                  2 4: 1-3
                  2 8: 1-7
                  2 11: 1-10
                  3 12: 2-11
                  4 7: 3-6
                  4 12: 3-11
                  6 11: 6-10
                  7 13: 6-12
                  9 10: 8-9
                  9 12: 8-11

            Then:

                node0: 1 -> edges: to 5 (node4) and 7 (node6) -> [4,6]
                node1: 2 -> edges: to 4 (node3), 8 (node7), 11 (node10) -> [3,7,10]
                node2: 3 -> to 12 (node11) -> [11]
                node3: 4 -> to 2 (node1) and 7 (node6) and 12 (node11) -> [1,6,11] 
                node4: 5 -> to 1 (node0) -> [0]
                node5: 6 -> not used? 
                node6: 7 -> to 1 (node0), 4 (node3), 11 (node10), 13 (node12) -> [0,3,10,12]
                node7: 8 -> to 2 (node1) -> [1]
                node8: 9 -> to 10 (node9), 12 (node11) -> [9,11]
                node9: 10 -> to 9 (node8) and 6 (node6) -> [8,6]? 
                node10: 11 -> to 2 (node1) and 4 (node3) and 9 (node8) and 6 (node6) -> [1,3,8,6]? 
                Actually, wait: 
                    edge "6 11": 6-10? -> node6 and node10? 
                    then node10: index10? 
                But the input: 
                    "6 11": 6 is node6? 11 is node10? 
                    "2 11": 2 is node1? 11 is node10? 
                    "4 12": 4 is node3? 12 is node11? 
                    "3 12": 3 is node2? 12 is node11? 
                    "9 12": 9 is node8? 12 is node11? 
                    "6 11": 6 is node6? 11 is node10? 

                Then: 
                    node6: 7 -> connected to: 
                        1: node0? 
                        4: node3? 
                        11: node10? 
                        13: node12? 
                    So node6: [0,3,10,12]

                    node10: 11 -> connected to: 
                        2: node1? (edge 2-11: 1-10) 
                        6: node6? (edge 6-11: 6-10) 
                        9: node8? (edge 9-12: 8-11 -> wait, no: edge 9-12: 8-11? but 12 is node11? 
                    Actually, edge "9 12": 9 is node8? 12 is node11? -> so node8 to node11? 
                    Then node10 (11) is only connected to node1 and node6? 

                So the graph is:

                    node0: [4,6] 
                    node1: [3,7,10] 
                    node2: [11] 
                    node3: [1,6,11] 
                    node4: [0] 
                    node5: 
                    node6: [0,3,10,12] 
                    node7: [1] 
                    node8: [9,11] 
                    node9: [8] 
                    node10: [1,6] 
                    node11: [2,3,8,6]?  -> no: 
                        node11: 
                            from edge "3 12": 2-11 -> node2 to node11? 
                            from edge "4 12": 3-11? 
                            from edge "9 12": 8-11? 
                            from edge "7 13": 6-12? -> but 13 is node12? then that edge is 6 to 12? so node12: 
                    Actually, the last edge: 7 13 -> 6 to 12? 
                    Then node12: 13 -> connected to 6? 
                    Then we have 13 nodes: 
                        node0: 1
                        node1: 2
                        node2: 3
                        node3: 4
                        node4: 5
                        node5: 6  -> but we don't have an edge for 6? 
                        node6: 7
                        node7: 8
                        node8: 9
                        node9: 10
                        node10: 11
                        node11: 12
                        node12: 13

                Then the edges:

                    node0: 1 -> [4,6]   (to 5,7) -> node0 to node4, node0 to node6.
                    node1: 2 -> [3,7,10] (to 4,8,11) -> node1 to node3, node1 to node7, node1 to node10.
                    node2: 3 -> [11]     (to 12) -> node2 to node11.
                    node3: 4 -> [1,6,11] (to 2,7,12) -> node3 to node1, node3 to node6, node3 to node11.
                    node4: 5 -> [0]      (to 1) -> node4 to node0.
                    node5: 6 -> [] 
                    node6: 7 -> [0,3,10,12] (to 1,4,11,13) -> node6 to node0, node6 to node3, node6 to node10, node6 to node12.
                    node7: 8 -> [1]      (to 2) -> node7 to node1.
                    node8: 9 -> [9,11]   (to 10,12) -> node8 to node9, node8 to node11? 
                    node9: 10 -> [8]     (to 9) -> node9 to node8.
                    node10: 11 -> [1,6]  (to 2,7) -> node10 to node1, node10 to node6.
                    node11: 12 -> [2,3,8] (to 3,4,9) -> node11 to node2, node11 to node3, node11 to node8? 
                    node12: 13 -> [6]    (to 7) -> node12 to node6.

            Then the component for node3 (which is node3: 4) has neighbors: 
                node1 (2), node6 (7), node11 (12).

            Then the three components:

                Component1: from node1 (1-indexed:2) -> 
                    Then we BFS: 
                        node1: [3,7,10] -> but 3 is the candidate? skip. Then 7 and 10? 
                        Then from node7: [1] -> already visited? 
                        Then from node10: [1,6] -> 1 visited, 6? but 6 is in another component? 
                    Actually, we are in the component: 
                        We start at node1: 
                            we add node1 -> then we look at neighbors: 
                                node3 (skip because candidate) -> then node7 and node10? 
                            Then we add node7 and node10. 
                            Then from node7: 
                                neighbors: [1] -> visited -> done.
                            Then from node10: 
                                neighbors: [1] (visited) and [6] -> but 6 is not in the candidate? and 6 is not the candidate? 
                                But wait: the candidate is node3, and 6 is a neighbor of node3? Then 6 is in a different component? 
                    Actually, the graph without node3: 
                        The edges: 
                            node1: connected to node7 and node10? 
                            node7: connected to node1? 
                            node10: connected to node1? 
                        Then the component: {1,7,10}? 
                    Then the size=3, but s= (13-1)//3 = 12//3=4? -> not 3. 
                    Then we break: skip candidate.

            This indicates an error: the sample input has 13 nodes? and the candidate node3 (4) has degree 3, so we expect each component to be 4 nodes.

            What should be the components?

                Component A: {5,1,7,13} -> 0-indexed: 
                    5 -> node4
                    1 -> node0
                    7 -> node6
                    13 -> node12
                Then: {4,0,6,12}

                Component B: {8,2,11,6} -> 
                    8 -> node7
                    2 -> node1
                    11 -> node10
                    6 -> node5? 
                But wait, the input doesn't have 6? 
                Actually, the input has 13 nodes: 1 to 13. 
                The component B: 
                    nodes: 8,2,11,6 -> 
                        8: node7
                        2: node1
                        11: node10
                        6: ??? -> the input has 6? 
                The input edge: "6 11" -> 6 and 11: which are nodes? 
                    6 is 6? and 11 is 10? 
                Then component B: {7,1,10,6} -> but 6 is node6? and we already have node6 in component A? 

            This is confusing. 

            Actually, the problem figure: 
                Component A: {5,1,7,13}
                Component B: {8,2,11,6} 
                Component C: {3,12,9,10}

            In 0-indexed:

                Component A: 
                    5 -> node4
                    1 -> node0
                    7 -> node6
                    13 -> node12
                Component B: 
                    8 -> node7
                    2 -> node1
                    11 -> node10
                    6 -> node5? -> but wait, we don't have node5? 
                The input: 
                    "6 11": 6 is node5? and 11 is node10? 
                Then component B: {5,1,10,7}? -> no: 
                    node5: 6? 
                    node1: 2? 
                    node10: 11? 
                    node7: 8? 
                But the figure: component B: 8,2,11,6 -> then 6 is 6? 
                Then node5: 6? 
                Then we have:

                    Component A: [0,4,6,12] -> but 6 is node6? and in component B we have node5? 
                Then there is no conflict? 

            How do we map the numbers:

                1: node0
                2: node1
                3: node2
                4: node3
                5: node4
                6: node5
                7: node6
                8: node7
                9: node8
                10: node9
                11: node10
                12: node11
                13: node12

            Then:

                Component A: {5,1,7,13} -> {4,0,6,12} -> nodes:0,4,6,12
                Component B: {8,2,11,6} -> {7,1,10,5} -> nodes:1,5,7,10
                Component C: {3,12,9,10} -> {2,11,8,9} -> nodes:2,8,9,11

            Then the candidate node3 (4) has neighbors: 
                node0: from edge 1-5: 0-4 -> but 4 is node3? -> so neighbor0: node0? 
                node6: from edge 4-7: 3-6 -> neighbor1: node6? 
                node11: from edge 4-12: 3-11? -> neighbor2: node11? 

            Then we form:

                Component1: starting from node0: 
                    Then we get: 
                        node0: [4,6] -> 4 is candidate? skip. Then 6? but 6 is neighbor? so we don't go that way? 
                    Actually, we do BFS in the graph without the candidate. 
                    Then from node0: 
                        connected to 4? skip. 
                        connected to 6? but 6 is a neighbor of the candidate? then 6 is in a different component? 
                    How to do BFS? 
                        Start from node0: 
                            we can go to node0, then we look at neighbors: 
                                node4 (candidate) -> skip
                                node6: which is connected to the candidate? skip? 
                        Then we don't get any node? 

            Correction: the edge between node0 and node6: 
                In the graph: 
                    node0: [4,6] 
                    node6: [0,3,10,12] 
                When we remove candidate node3, then the edge between node0 and node6 is still there? 
                But wait: the candidate is node3, which is not node0 or node6. Then the edge is present? 

            Then from node0: 
                we see node4 (candidate: skip) and node6 (not candidate: then we add node6). 
                Then from node6: 
                    neighbors: node0 (visited), node3 (candidate: skip), node10, node12. 
                    Then we add node10 and node12? 
                Then the component: {0,6,10,12} -> but that's 4 nodes.

            But the sample component A is {0,4,6,12}? 4 is the candidate? no, the candidate is removed. Then component A should be {0,6,12,?} -> and 4 is candidate? not included. 

            How did we get node10? 

            Actually, the figure: 
                Component A: {5,1,7,13} -> node4, node0, node6, node12? 
                Then the edges: 
                    node0 (1) connected to node4 (5) and node6 (7) -> then without candidate, we have: 
                        0-4? 4 is candidate? skip -> then 0-6? 
                    Then the component: 
                        0 connected to 6, and 6 connected to 12 (13) -> then we have 0,6,12. 
                    But we miss node4? 

            The problem: the candidate is 4 (node3). Then the component A: 
                nodes: 5 (node4) is not connected to any other node? 
                How? 
                    The edge 1-5: 0-4 -> then without the candidate, node0 is not connected to node4? because the candidate is not in the component? 
                    Then node4 is isolated? 
                Then we have two components from neighbor0? 
                    one: node0, node6, node12 -> size=3
                    one: node4 -> size=1

            Then we do not get one component of 4 nodes? 

            This indicates that our BFS must start from the neighbor and then we include all nodes that are connected without going through the candidate.

            How to do: 
                We start from neighbor v (node0) and we do not traverse the candidate. 
                Then we will get: 
                    Start at node0: 
                        neighbors: 4 (candidate: skip), 6 (add) 
                    Then from node6: 
                        neighbors: 0 (visited), 3 (candidate: skip), 10, 12 -> then we add 10 and 12? 
                    Then from node10: 
                        neighbors: 1 (if 1 is not candidate? we add) -> but 1 is not candidate? 
                    Then we get more than 4 nodes? 

            This is complex. 

            We must design the BFS to only traverse within the component. The rule: 
                We start from v, and we are allowed to go to any node except the candidate.

            Then in the entire graph without candidate, we have:

                Component from node0: 
                    node0: connected to node4? -> skip (because candidate) 
                    node0: connected to node6? -> then we add node6. 
                    Then from node6: 
                        connected to node0 (visited), candidate (skip), node10, node12 -> then we add node10 and node12. 
                    Then from node10: 
                        connected to node1? (which is a neighbor of the candidate? but not candidate) -> then we add node1? 
                    Then from node12: 
                        connected to node6 (visited) and candidate? -> skip. 
                    Then from node1: 
                        connected to candidate? skip, and node7, node10 (visited) -> then we add node7? 
                    Then from node7: 
                        connected to node1 (visited) -> done. 
                Then we get: {0,6,10,12,1,7} -> size=6.

            This is not 4.

            How does the sample work? 

            The sample figure: 
                Component A: {5,1,7,13} -> 
                    How are they connected? 
                        The figure: 
                            5 connected to 1? 
                            1 connected to 7? 
                            7 connected to 13? 
                        Then a chain: 5-1-7-13.

                But in the input, we have:
                    edge "1 5": 0-4
                    edge "1 7": 0-6
                    edge "4 7": 3-6 -> but 4 is candidate, so removed. 
                    edge "7 13": 6-12

                Then without candidate, the edges for this component: 
                    0-4: 4 is candidate -> removed.
                    0-6: present
                    6-12: present
                    and 0-6: present, 6-12: present -> then we have 0-6-12, and node4 is isolated? 

                Then we have two components from neighbor0: 
                    one: {0,6,12} -> size=3
                    one: {4} -> size=1

            This does not match.

            After re-examining the figure: 
                Component A: {5,1,7,13}: 
                    edges: 
                        5-1: present (edge "1 5")
                        1-7: present (edge "1 7")
                        7-13: present (edge "7 13")
                    and there is no edge 1-4? because 4 is candidate? removed.

                But then how is 4 (candidate) connected to 7? by edge "4 7" -> removed.

                Then the component is {0,4,6,12} is not correct. 
                The component should be {0,6,12} and {4}? 

            But the sample figure shows component A as a chain of 4 nodes: 5,1,7,13. 

            How is 5 connected to 1? -> edge present.
            How is 1 connected to 7? -> edge present.
            How is 7 connected to 13? -> edge present.

            Then in our graph: 
                node4 (5) is only connected to node0 (1) -> edge present? 
                node0 (1) is connected to node4 (5) and node6 (7) -> then node0 has two edges: to 4 and 6.
                Then the chain should be: 4-0-6-12.

            But then the candidate is node3 (4) is not in this chain.

            So the component from neighbor0 (node0) should include node4? 
                But node4 is not the candidate? 
                However, the candidate is node3 (4) -> which is 4 in 1-indexed, and node3 in 0-indexed. 
                node4 in 0-indexed is 5 in 1-indexed.

            Then node4 (5) is not the candidate? so we should include it.

            Then from node0: 
                we see node4 and node6. 
                Then we add node4 and node6. 
                Then from node4: 
                    neighbors: only node0? -> done.
                Then from node6: 
                    neighbors: node0 (visited), candidate? node3 (4 in 1-indexed) -> skip, and node10, node12? 
                Then we add node10 and node12? 

            But then we get more than 4 nodes? 

            The edge between node0 and node6 is present, and the edge between node6 and node12 is present, and node12 is 13? 
            Then the chain: node4 (5) - node0 (1) - node6 (7) - node12 (13) -> that's 4 nodes: 4,0,6,12.

            And are there any other edges? 
                node6 also connected to node10? and node3? 
            But node3 is candidate: removed. node10 is not in this component? 

            Why not? 
                Because the BFS starts from node0 and we are only allowed to go to non-candidate nodes. 
                Then from node6, we see node10? node10 is not candidate, so we should add it? 

            But the sample component A is only 4,0,6,12. 

            What is the edge between node6 and node10? 
                In the input: "6 11" -> node6 to node10 (because 11 is node10). 
            Then it is present. 

            Then we must include node10? 

            But then the component has 5 nodes: 4,0,6,12,10. 

            This is not 4.

        This indicates a mistake in the provided example? or in our interpretation.

        Let me read the sample input: 
            "6 11" -> 6 and 11: which are 7 and 11 in the figure? 
        In the figure, is there an edge between 7 and 11? 
            In component A: 5,1,7,13: then 7 is in component A, and 11 is in component B: {8,2,11,6}. 
            Then there is no edge between 7 and 11? 

        But the input has edge between 7 and 11? 

        How to reconcile: 
            The input edge "6 11": 
                6: is that node 6 or node7? 
                In the input, the nodes are labeled from 1 to 13. 
                Edge "6 11": meaning between node6 and node11. 
                In the figure, node6 might be in component B and node11 might be in component B? 
                Then the edge is within component B.

        In our 0-indexed mapping: 
            node5: 6? 
            node10: 11? 
        Then the edge "6 11": node5 to node10. 
        Then in the component from node0 (neighbor0), we don't have node5 or node10? 

        But wait, we have an edge from node6 (7) to node10 (11) in the input? 
            The input edge "6 11": node6 to node10? 
            But we mapped: 
                node6: 7? 
                node10: 11? 
            Then edge between 7 and 11? 

        Then in the graph, node6 (7) is in component A and node10 (11) is in component B? 
        How can we have an edge between them? 

        This indicates that in the sample input, the edge "6 11" is between node6 and node11 (12 in 1-indexed) or what? 

        Let me count: 
            The edge list: 
                1: 1-5 (node0-node4)
                2: 1-7 (node0-node6)
                3: 2-4 (node1-node3)
                4: 2-8 (node1-node7)
                5: 2-11 (node1-node10)
                6: 3-12 (node2-node11)
                7: 4-7 (node3-node6)
                8: 4-12 (node3-node11)
                9: 6-11 (node6-node10)   -> this is the edge in question: between node6 and node10
                10: 7-13 (node6-node12)   -> node6 to node12
                11: 9-10 (node8-node9)
                12: 9-12 (node8-node11)

        Then indeed, there is an edge between node6 and node10. 

        Then in the tree, node6 (7) is in the same component as node0 (1)? and node10 (11) is in the component of node1 (2)? 

        Then when we remove node3 (4), the edge between node6 and node10 should be cut? 
        But wait, the tree is still connected? 

        How the tree is structured: 
            Without node3 (4), the tree breaks into three components: 
                Component1: node0, node4, node6, node12   (because: 0-4,0-6,6-12) -> and also 6-10? 
                Component2: node1, node7, node10          (because: 1-7,1-10) 
                Component3: node2, node8, node9, node11   (because: 2-11,8-9,8-11)

        But the edge node6-node10 (7-11) connects Component1 and Component2? 
        Then the removal of node3 (4) should break the tree into two components? 

        This is a contradiction.

        After re-examining the sample input: 
            It is the tree from the figure: 
                The good cutting point is node4 (1-indexed), which is node3 in 0-indexed. 
                After removal, we get three components: 
                    A: 1,5,7,13  -> node0, node4, node6, node12
                    B: 2,8,11,6  -> node1, node7, node10, node5   [6 is node5?]
                    C: 3,12,9,10 -> node2, node11, node8, node9

            How to reconcile the edge "6 11": 
                In the sample input, "6 11": between 6 and 11. 
                In the figure, in component B: 6 and 11 are both in component B. 
                In our mapping, 6 is node5 and 11 is node10. 
                Then the edge is between node5 and node10, and both are in component B. 

            Then the edge is within component B. 

            And the edge "7 13": between 7 and 13: 
                In the figure, 7 is in component A and 13 in component A? 
                In our mapping, 7 is node6 and 13 is node12, both in component A.

            And the edge "9 12": between 9 and 12: 
                In the figure, 12 is in component C and 9 in component C? 
                In our mapping, 9 is node8 and 12 is node11, both in component C.

            Then the edge "6 11" is within component B: node5 to node10. 

            How about the edge between node6 (7) and node10 (11)? 
                We don't have that edge. 
                We have edge between node5 (6) and node10 (11) -> which is within component B.

            So the mapping is: 
                node0: 1
                node1: 2
                node2: 3
                node3: 4  (the candidate)
                node4: 5
                node5: 6
                node6: 7
                node7: 8
                node8: 9
                node9: 10
                node10: 11
                node11: 12
                node12: 13

            Then the edge "6 11": between node5 and node10.

            Then the components for candidate node3 (4 in 1-indexed) are:

                Component1 (from neighbor0: node0): 
                    node0: [4,6] -> 
                        node4 (5) and node6 (7) are not candidate, so we add node4 and node6.
                    node4: [0] -> done.
                    node6: [0,3,10,12] -> 
                        3 is candidate: skip. 
                        10: which is 11? -> node10: not in this component? 
                        12: which is 13? -> node12.
                    Then from node6: we add node12.
                    Then node12: [6] -> done.
                    Then we have: {0,4,6,12} (1,5,7,13) -> size=4.

                Component2 (from neighbor1: node1): 
                    node1: [3,7,10] -> 
                        3: candidate -> skip.
                        7: node7 (8) -> add.
                        10: node10 (11) -> add.
                    node7: [1] -> done.
                    node10: [1,5] -> 
                        1: visited, 5: node5 (6) -> add.
                    node5: [10] -> done.
                    Then we have: {1,7,10,5} (2,8,11,6) -> size=4.

                Component3 (from neighbor2: node11): 
                    node11: [2,3,8] -> 
                        3: candidate -> skip.
                        2: node2 (3) -> add.
                        8: node8 (9) -> add.
                    node2: [11] -> done.
                    node8: [11,9] -> 
                        11: visited, 9: node9 (10) -> add.
                    node9: [8] -> done.
                    Then we have: {11,2,8,9} (12,3,9,10) -> size=4.

            This matches.

        Therefore, we must use the mapping as above.

        In summary, the B for a node in the component: we only consider edges within the component? 
            When building the degree for the center peeling, we only consider edges within the component.

        For the BFS to form the component, we must only include the nodes that are reachable without going through the candidate.

        And for the hashing: within the component, we only consider edges within the component.

        We do that by: 
            - When we BFS to form the component, we only traverse non-candidate nodes and we get a set of nodes.
            - Then when we build the subgraph for the component, for each node in the component, we only consider edges to other nodes in the component.

        How we do that in code for the center peeling and for the hashing? 
            - In the center peeling: we recompute the degree for the component: 
                  for node in comp_set:
                      deg_comp[node] = 0
                      for neighbor in graph[node]:
                          if neighbor in comp_set: 
                              deg_comp[node] += 1

            - Similarly, when we build the tree for hashing (from a center), we only consider edges within the component.

        We have the comp_set. We can use: 
            if neighbor in comp_set: then it's within the component.

 42. We'll code accordingly.

 43. We hope it passes.

 Let me refactor the BFS for the component formation: we did use the comp_set, and when we did BFS, we did not go to the candidate. 

 But in the hashing part, we are using the global graph, but we check: 
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor in comp_set and neighbor != parent: 

 44. We run the sample input 13. 

 45. We output 3.

 46. We run the sample input 6: 
        "6
         1 2
         1 3
         2 4
         3 5
         3 6"

        Then we see if there's any candidate: 
            node0: 1 -> deg=2, (6-1)=5 -> 5%2!=0 -> skip.
            node1: 2 -> deg=2, 5%2!=0 -> skip.
            node2: 3 -> deg=2, 5%2!=0 -> skip.
            node3: 4 -> deg=1 -> skip.
            node4: 5 -> deg=1 -> skip.
            node5: 6 -> deg=1 -> skip.

        Then output -1.

 47. We hope it's correct.

 Given the complexity, we hope the hashing is collision-free for the sample and for the constraints.

 We choose a large base and double mod.

 Let's code accordingly.
