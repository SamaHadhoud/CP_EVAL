 We are going to follow the editorial guidelines exactly.

 Steps:
 1. For each land, normalize to (long, short) = (max(L_i, W_i), min(L_i, W_i)).
 2. candidate_one: maximum of (long_i * short_i) over all lands. Then, the building area for single land option is candidate_one / 2.
 3. For candidate_two (two lands option):
    - Sort lands by long_i in descending order.
    - Traverse the sorted list, and for each land, we consider the building dimensions as:
          building_long = long_i   (since we are going to assign the building's long side to be at most long_i, and we are traversing from large long_i to smaller)
          building_short = min(short_i, max_short_so_far)   [but note: the building's short side must be at most the short_i of the current land and the max_short_so_far (which is the maximum short_i we've seen so far) and also note that the building's long side must be at most the long_i of the other land (which we are considering via the sorted order and max_short_so_far from larger lands)].

    However, note: we are going to assign the building to have dimensions (A, B) such that:
        A <= long_i, B <= short_i   (for current land) and 
        A <= long_j, B <= short_j   (for another land j).

    Since we are sorting by long_i descending, when we are at land i, we have already processed lands j with long_j >= long_i. For the building's long side (A) we can set at most long_i (because land j has long_j>=long_i so A<=long_i will be <= long_j, and land i has A<=long_i). For the building's short side (B), we require B <= short_i and also B <= short_j for the other land j. But note: we are maintaining the maximum short_i encountered so far (max_short) from the lands we have already seen. However, the constraint for the building's short side is that it must be <= min(short_i, max_short). But wait: the building's short side must be at most the short_i of the current land and at most the short_j of the other land. Since the other land j has short_j at least the max_short we've seen? Actually, we are maintaining the maximum short_i so far, but we need the minimum between the current land's short_i and the max_short (which is the maximum of the shorts from the lands with longer long side). However, the building's short side must be at most short_i and also at most the short_j of the other land. The other land j has short_j which is at least max_short? Actually, we have the max_short as the maximum of the shorts we have seen, but we are interested in the constraint for the building: B <= min(short_i, short_j). But note: we are going to pick one j from the previously processed lands. The best we can do for the building's short side is min(short_i, max_short) only if max_short is the maximum of the shorts? Actually, no: we want the building's short side to be at most min(short_i, short_j) for a particular j. However, we are trying to maximize the building area: A * B = long_i * B, and we set A = long_i (because we cannot exceed the current land's long, and the other land has long at least as large) and then we set B as the minimum between short_i and the max_short? But note: the max_short we have is the maximum short side among the lands we've seen. However, the building's short side must be at most both short_i and the short_j of the other land. The constraint for the building's short side is B <= min(short_i, short_j). We cannot set B to min(short_i, max_short) because max_short is the maximum short, which might be larger than the short_j of the land we choose. Actually, we want to choose a land j that has a large short_j? But note: we are trying to maximize the building's short side. The best building's short side we can get for the current land i and a previously seen land j is min(short_i, short_j). However, we are maintaining the maximum short_j (max_short) from the previous lands. But if we set the building's short side to min(short_i, max_short), then we are constrained by the current land's short_i and the maximum short_j we've seen. However, we cannot exceed the current land's short_i, and we cannot exceed the short_j of the land j we choose. But if the land j has short_j = max_short, then we can set B = min(short_i, max_short). However, what if we have two lands: land1: (10, 5) and land2: (9, 7). Then when we process land2 (long=9, short=7), we have max_short from land1 as 5? Then we set B = min(7,5)=5. Then building = 9*5 = 45. But what if we use land1 and land2? The building long side must be <= min(10,9)=9, and the building short side must be <= min(5,7)=5. So 9*5=45 is correct.

    However, note: we can also consider the building with swapped orientation? Actually, we normalized the lands and the building can be placed in either orientation. So we assume the building has long side A and short side B? Actually, we don't need to fix the building's orientation because we can assign arbitrarily. But note: the two buildings must be the same. We are free to assign the building's long and short as long as they fit.

    But in the two lands option, we are not constrained to assign the same orientation? Actually, we can rotate independently. So for land i, we can assign the building as (A, B) or (B, A). However, we normalized the land to (long_i, short_i). Then the condition for land i is:
        A <= long_i and B <= short_i   OR   A <= short_i and B <= long_i.
    But note: because we normalized, we have long_i>=short_i. Also, we are going to set A>=B for the building? Actually, we don't know. But note: we can always normalize the building as well: let A be the larger dimension and B the smaller. Then the condition becomes:
        A <= long_i and B <= short_i   (because the other orientation would require A<=short_i and B<=long_i, but if A>=B then A<=long_i and B<=short_i is the same as the condition for the building? Actually, no: we can also use the other orientation? But if we have a building (A, B) with A>=B, then:
          - If we assign the building as (A, B) to land i: we require A<=long_i and B<=short_i.
          - If we assign as (B, A): we require B<=long_i (which is true because A<=long_i and B<=A) and A<=short_i? But A>=B and A<=long_i, but we don't know if A<=short_i. So the condition (B, A) might fail because A might be bigger than short_i.

        Therefore, the building can be placed on land i if and only if A<=long_i and B<=short_i? Actually, no: we might use the other orientation only if A<=short_i and B<=long_i. But if we have A>=B, then the condition A<=short_i is more restrictive than A<=long_i (since short_i<=long_i). So the condition for the building (A>=B) on land i becomes:
          - Either we put the building in the original orientation: then we require A<=long_i and B<=short_i.
          - Or we put the building rotated: then we require A<=short_i and B<=long_i. But note: because A>=B, we have B<=long_i is automatically satisfied if A<=long_i? Not necessarily: we require both A<=short_i and B<=long_i. However, if A<=short_i, then since short_i<=long_i, we have A<=long_i and then B<=A<=long_i, so both are satisfied. Therefore, the building (A>=B) can be placed on land i if either A<=long_i and B<=short_i OR A<=short_i. But note: if A<=short_i, then we can rotate the building to have the long side (which is A) become the building's height in the land's short dimension? Actually, we can rotate arbitrarily. So the condition is: 
            (A <= long_i and B <= short_i) OR (A <= short_i and B <= long_i) 
          But note: because we have normalized the land (long_i>=short_i) and building (A>=B), then:
            Condition 1: A<=long_i and B<=short_i.
            Condition 2: A<=short_i and B<=long_i. But if A<=short_i, then since A>=B, we have B<=A<=short_i<=long_i, so condition 2 implies condition 1? Actually, condition 2 implies condition 1? Not exactly: condition 2 requires B<=long_i, which is always true because B<=A<=short_i<=long_i. And condition 2 requires A<=short_i, then condition 1's A<=long_i is true and B<=short_i is true. So condition 2 is a subset of condition 1? Actually, no: condition 1 requires B<=short_i, and condition 2 requires A<=short_i (and B<=long_i, which is redundant). But condition 1 does not require A<=short_i. Therefore, the building fits if either:
            A <= long_i and B <= short_i   OR   A<=short_i and B<=long_i.

          However, because we have normalized the building to A>=B, and the land has long_i>=short_i, the condition becomes: 
            The building fits if and only if A<=long_i and B<=short_i? 
          Why? Because if A<=short_i, then we have A<=short_i<=long_i and B<=A<=short_i<=long_i, so the building fits without rotation? Actually, we can always choose to assign arbitrarily. But note: the condition for the building in the land is that the side of the building must be <= the land's sides. So if we assign the building as (A, B) then we require A<=long_i and B<=short_i. If we assign as (B, A) then we require B<=long_i and A<=short_i. So the building fits if either of these two holds.

          Therefore, for land i, the building (A>=B) fits if:
             (A <= long_i and B <= short_i) OR (B <= long_i and A <= short_i)

          But note: because A>=B, we have:
             The first condition: A<=long_i and B<=short_i.
             The second condition: A<=short_i and B<=long_i. But since A>=B, the second condition implies the first? Actually, if A<=short_i, then since short_i<=long_i, we have A<=long_i. And B<=A<=short_i, so B<=short_i. Therefore, the second condition implies the first. So the building fits if the first condition holds? Then why do we have two conditions? Actually, the two conditions are independent: if A is very large (but <=long_i) and B is very large (but <=long_i) but if B>short_i, then we cannot use the first orientation. However, we can rotate: then we require A<=short_i? But if A>short_i, then the second condition fails. So the building fits only if A<=long_i and B<=short_i? 

          Actually, the building (A>=B) fits if:
             (A <= long_i and B <= short_i)   OR   (A <= short_i and B <= long_i) 
          But note: the second condition is redundant because if A<=short_i, then A<=long_i (since short_i<=long_i) and B<=A<=short_i, so the first condition holds. Therefore, the building (A>=B) fits in land i if and only if A<=long_i and B<=short_i.

    So we can assume that for the two lands option, we require the building to have A (long) <= min(long_i, long_j) and B (short) <= min(short_i, short_j). But note: we are using two different lands. Therefore, the building must satisfy:
        A <= long_i, B <= short_i   (for land i) and
        A <= long_j, B <= short_j   (for land j)

    So overall: 
        A <= min(long_i, long_j) 
        B <= min(short_i, short_j)

    Then the area of one building is A*B. We want to maximize A*B. How?
        We set A = min(long_i, long_j) and B = min(short_i, short_j) and then the area = min(long_i, long_j) * min(short_i, short_j). But note: we are constrained by the building's own normalization: we can set A to min(long_i, long_j) and B to min(short_i, short_j) and then we have A>=B? Not necessarily: min(long_i, long_j) might be less than min(short_i, short_j). Then we would have to swap the building's dimensions? Actually, we can assign arbitrarily: we can let the building be (A, B) with A = min(long_i, long_j) and B = min(short_i, short_j) and then if A < B, we can rotate the building so that the building's long side is B and short side is A? But then the condition for land i: we require the building's long side (B) to be <= long_i? Yes, because B = min(short_i, short_j) <= short_i <= long_i. Similarly, the building's short side (A) would be <= short_i? Actually, A = min(long_i, long_j) which is <= long_i, but we don't know if it is <= short_i. So we cannot arbitrarily set the building to have long side = min(long_i, long_j) and short side = min(short_i, short_j) without considering the possibility that min(long_i, long_j) might be less than min(short_i, short_j). Therefore, we must normalize the building: set A = max(min(long_i, long_j), min(short_i, short_j)) and B = min(min(long_i, long_j), min(short_i, short_j))? Then the building area is A * B = min(long_i, long_j) * min(short_i, short_j). Actually, the product is the same regardless of which one is longer. So we can simply compute min(long_i, long_j) * min(short_i, short_j) as the candidate area for the two lands.

    However, note: we are traversing the lands sorted by long_i descending. And we are maintaining the maximum short_i so far (max_short). Then for the current land (long_i, short_i), we can set:
        A = long_i   (because we are going to use the current land's long_i as the limiting factor for the building's long side? Actually, the building's long side is constrained by min(long_i, long_j). Since we are processing lands with long_i descending, the next lands we see will have long_j <= current long_i. Therefore, the building's long side can be at most long_i (because the other land j we choose has long_j>=long_i? Actually, we have processed lands with long_j>=long_i, so min(long_i, long_j)=long_i). Then the building's short side is constrained by min(short_i, short_j) for the other land j. We are maintaining the maximum short_j (max_short) from the lands we have already processed. However, the building's short side must be at most short_i and at most the short_j of the land j we choose. The best we can do is set the building's short side to min(short_i, max_short). But note: the candidate area for the building using the current land and a land j is long_i * min(short_i, short_j). Since we are maintaining the maximum short_j (max_short) from the previous lands, we cannot set the building's short side to min(short_i, max_short) because that uses the maximum short_j? Actually, we want to maximize min(short_i, short_j) for a land j. The maximum min(short_i, short_j) we can get from the previous lands is min(short_i, max_short) if we pick a land j that has short_j = max_short? But if max_short is at least short_i, then min(short_i, max_short)=short_i. If max_short is less than short_i, then it's max_short. So the candidate area for the building when pairing land i with one of the previous lands is long_i * min(short_i, max_short).

    However, is that the best candidate? Consider we have two lands j1 and j2: j1 has short_j1 = 10, j2 has short_j2 = 20. Then max_short=20. Then for a current land i with short_i=15, we set the building's short side to min(15,20)=15. But if we choose land j1, we get min(short_i, short_j1)=min(15,10)=10. If we choose land j2, we get min(15,20)=15. So by maintaining max_short, we get the best candidate? Actually, we want the maximum value of min(short_i, short_j) over all j we've seen. How do we compute that? We can note:

        candidate_short = min(short_i, max_short)

    because if we have a land j with short_j = max_short, then min(short_i, max_short) is the best we can get? Because:
        - If max_short <= short_i, then min(short_i, short_j) for any land j is at most max_short, and we achieve max_short by the land that has that max_short.
        - If max_short > short_i, then min(short_i, short_j) is at most short_i, and we achieve short_i.

    Therefore, the candidate area for two lands when using the current land i and a land j from the previously seen (with long_j>=long_i) is: long_i * min(short_i, max_short). Then we update candidate_two as the maximum of these candidate areas.

    But note: we must consider that the building's dimensions can be swapped? Actually, we have normalized the building to have the long side as the larger dimension? However, in our candidate we set:
        building_long = long_i
        building_short = min(short_i, max_short)

    Then the area is long_i * min(short_i, max_short). But what if min(short_i, max_short) > long_i? Then we should swap? Actually, we can always swap arbitrarily. But note: the building's long side must be the larger of the two dimensions? Then we would set the building to be (max(long_i, min(short_i, max_short)), min(long_i, min(short_i, max_short))). But then the area is the same: the product. So we don't need to swap for the area calculation.

    Therefore, the candidate area for two lands for the current land i is long_i * min(short_i, max_short).

 4. After processing all lands, we have candidate_one (max product for one land) and candidate_two (max area for two lands). Then the answer is:
        candidate = max( candidate_one / 2, candidate_two )
    But note: candidate_two is the area for one building? Actually, candidate_two is the area of one building (A*B) that we can build twice? Then the problem asks for the building area (so one building). Therefore, we compare:
        candidate_one / 2   [which is the area of one building when built on one land] 
        and candidate_two   [which is the area of one building when built on two lands]

    However, note: candidate_two is computed as the product of the building's dimensions (A*B) that can be built on two lands. So we output the maximum between these two.

    But wait: we must output the maximum building area. So the answer is max(candidate_one/2, candidate_two).

    However, note: we have candidate_two computed as long_i * min(short_i, max_short) for some land i and j. This candidate_two is the area of one building? Yes.

    Therefore, we set:
        ans = max(candidate_one / 2, candidate_two)

    But note: candidate_one is an integer (product of two integers) so candidate_one/2 might be a float. And we have to output with exactly one decimal point.

    However, the problem says: output the largest building that ICPC Jakarta can build with exactly one decimal point.

    But note: the sample input #1: 
        2
        5 5
        3 4
        candidate_one = 5*5 = 25 -> 25/2 = 12.5 -> output 12.5
        candidate_two: 
            sort lands: [(5,5), (4,3)]? Actually, we normalize the second land: (4,3) -> (4,3) becomes (4,3) -> but then we sort by long descending: [(5,5), (4,3)].
            For the first land: 
                max_short = 0 -> skip candidate_two update, then update max_short=5.
            For the second land:
                max_short=5 -> candidate_ij = 4 * min(3,5)=4*3=12 -> candidate_two=12.
            Then we compare: 12.5 vs 12 -> 12.5 is larger -> output 12.5.

    Sample input #2:
        2
        2 5  -> normalized: (5,2)
        4 3  -> normalized: (4,3)
        candidate_one: max(5*2, 4*3)=max(10,12)=12 -> 12/2=6.0 -> candidate_one/2=6.0
        candidate_two:
            sort: [(5,2), (4,3)] -> descending by long: [5,2; 4,3]
            first land: candidate_two not updated (max_short=0), then update max_short=2.
            second land: candidate_ij = 4 * min(3,2)=4*2=8 -> candidate_two=8.
            Then candidate_two=8.0 > 6.0 -> output 8.0.

    But sample output #2 is 8.0.

    However, sample input #3:
        "3
         10 1 -> (10,1)
         9 8  -> (9,8)
         7 6  -> (7,6)"
        candidate_one: max(10*1, 9*8, 7*6) = max(10,72,42)=72 -> 72/2=36.0
        candidate_two: 
            sort: [(10,1), (9,8), (7,6)] -> descending by long: [10,9,7]
            first land: update max_short=1 -> candidate_ij: skip (first land)
            second land: candidate_ij = 9 * min(8, max_short=1) = 9*1=9 -> then update max_short to max(1,8)=8
            third land: candidate_ij = 7 * min(6,8)=7*6=42 -> candidate_two = max(9,42)=42
            Then compare: 36.0 vs 42.0 -> output 42.0.

    So the algorithm matches the samples.

 Implementation details:

    We must be cautious with integer overflow? The numbers are up to 10^9, so the product can be up to 10^18. We are using integers for candidate_one and candidate_two.

    Steps:
        candidate_one = max_i (long_i * short_i)
        candidate_two = 0

        sort lands by long_i descending.

        max_short = 0
        for each land (long_i, short_i) in the sorted list:
            if max_short > 0:
                temp = min(short_i, max_short)
                candidate_ij = long_i * temp
                if candidate_ij > candidate_two: candidate_two = candidate_ij
            if short_i > max_short: max_short = short_i

        Then:
            candidate_one_half = candidate_one / 2.0   -> but we have to output as integer.0 or half .5

        However, the problem says: output a number representing the largest building with exactly one decimal point.

        We have two candidates: candidate_two (which is an integer) and candidate_one_half (which might be integer or half).

        So we compare:
            candidate_one_half = candidate_one / 2.0
            candidate_two

        Then the answer = max(candidate_one_half, candidate_two)

        But we have to output with one decimal point.

        How to output?
            If the answer is an integer: output integer part and then ".0"
            If the answer is half-integer: output integer part and then ".5"

        However, note: candidate_two is an integer? Yes, because it is long_i * min(short_i, max_short) and both are integers.

        candidate_one_half: 
            If candidate_one is even: then integer -> output integer_value.0
            If candidate_one is odd: then half -> output integer_part.5

        But note: candidate_one_half might be larger than candidate_two? Then we output candidate_one_half in the specified format.

        Alternatively, we can compare without floating point: 
            if candidate_one >= 2 * candidate_two:
                then candidate_one_half is the answer -> output as described.
            else:
                then candidate_two is the answer -> output candidate_two with ".0"

    Why is this valid?
        candidate_one_half = candidate_one / 2.0
        candidate_two is an integer.

        candidate_one_half >= candidate_two   <=>   candidate_one >= 2 * candidate_two

    So we can avoid floating point until output.

    Therefore, the code:

        if candidate_one >= 2 * candidate_two:
            if candidate_one % 2 == 0:
                print(f"{candidate_one//2}.0")
            else:
                print(f"{candidate_one//2}.5")
        else:
            print(f"{candidate_two}.0")

    However, note: candidate_one and candidate_two are integers? Yes, because they are products of integers.

    But candidate_one might be odd? Then candidate_one//2 is the integer division (floor). But we want (candidate_one)/2.0. For example, 25//2=12, and we output "12.5". That is correct.

    Let's test with candidate_one=25: then 25>=2*candidate_two? Then we output 12.5 -> which is 25//2 = 12 and then ".5".

    But if candidate_one=24: then 24//2=12 -> output "12.0".

    This matches.

    However, note: candidate_two might be fractional? Actually, no: it is an integer.

    So the code:

        Read n, lands.
        Normalize each land to (long, short) = (max(L_i,W_i), min(L_i,W_i))

        candidate_one = 0
        for each land: candidate_one = max(candidate_one, long*short)

        Sort lands by long descending.

        candidate_two = 0
        max_short = 0
        for each land in the sorted list:
            if max_short != 0:   # meaning we have at least one land before?
                temp = min(land.short, max_short)
                candidate_ij = land.long * temp
                candidate_two = max(candidate_two, candidate_ij)
            if land.short > max_short:
                max_short = land.short

        if candidate_one >= 2 * candidate_two:
            half = candidate_one // 2
            if candidate_one % 2 == 0:
                print(f"{half}.0")
            else:
                print(f"{half}.5")
        else:
            print(f"{candidate_two}.0")

    But note: the two lands candidate might be achieved by two lands that are not the same as the one we are processing? Actually, we are traversing and using the current land and one of the lands with long_i>=current long_i (because we sorted descending and update max_short from the ones we've seen). This method covers all pairs? Because for any pair (i, j) with long_i>=long_j, we process land j after land i? Actually, we sort descending by long, so the land with larger long is processed first. Then when we process land j (with long_j <= long_i of the lands we've processed) we consider the maximum short among the lands with long>=long_j. This includes land i. Therefore, we cover the pair (i, j) when we process land j (if land i has been processed and has a large short) and similarly we cover (j, i) when we process land i? Actually, we only consider the pair (i, j) when we process the land that comes later in the sorted order. But note: we are traversing from the largest long to the smallest. When we process a land, we pair it with a land that has been processed (which has long>=current). So if we have two lands: land1: (10,1) and land2: (9,8), then when processing land1 first (long=10) we don't have any max_short? Then when processing land2 (long=9) we use max_short=1 (from land1) -> candidate_ij=9*1=9. But we also have the pair (land2, land1): which is the same as (land1, land2). Actually, we only need to consider unordered pairs? And we are covering each pair exactly once? Actually, no: we are covering the pair when we process the land with the smaller long. So we cover the pair (land1, land2) when we process land2 (because land1 has been processed and has long=10>=9). Then we update candidate_two to 9. But the correct candidate for the pair (land1,land2) is min(10,9)=9 for the long and min(1,8)=1 for the short -> 9*1=9. Then we have candidate_two=9? But then we have land3: (7,6). Then we get candidate_ij=7*min(6, max_short)=max_short after land1 and land2 is max(1,8)=8 -> 7*min(6,8)=7*6=42. So candidate_two=42.

    How about a pair (land2, land3)? 
        When processing land3: long=7, max_short is max(1,8)=8 -> candidate_ij=7*min(6,8)=42 -> that's the same as the pair (land1,land3) and (land2,land3)? Actually, the candidate for the pair (land2,land3) is:
            min(long2, long3)=min(9,7)=7
            min(short2, short3)=min(8,6)=6
            so area=7*6=42 -> same as above.

    How about (land1,land3)? 
        min(10,7)=7, min(1,6)=1 -> area=7*1=7.

    So we are only getting 42 and 9? How did we get 42? We got 42 from land3 and the previous max_short=8 (which came from land2). So we are effectively pairing land3 with land2? But we are not explicitly storing all pairs. We are storing the maximum short so far. However, the candidate_ij for land3 is 7 * min(6,8)=42, which is the same as the pair (land2,land3). So we are covering the best pair for land3? 

    But what if we have land4: (6,5) and then land5: (5,10) and then land6: (4,9)? 
        We sort: [ (10,1), (9,8), (7,6), (6,5), (5,10), (4,9) ] -> note: (5,10) becomes (10,5) -> so the sorted list: [ (10,1), (10,5), (9,8), (7,6), (6,5), (4,9) ]

        For land (10,1): 
            update max_short=1
        For land (10,5): 
            candidate_ij = 10 * min(5,1)=10 -> candidate_two=10
            update max_short=5 (because 5>1)
        For land (9,8):
            candidate_ij = 9 * min(8,5)=45 -> candidate_two=45
            update max_short = max(5,8)=8
        For land (7,6):
            candidate_ij = 7 * min(6,8)=42 -> candidate_two remains 45
            update max_short = max(8,6)=8 (remains 8)
        For land (6,5):
            candidate_ij = 6 * min(5,8)=30 -> candidate_two remains 45
            update max_short = max(8,5)=8
        For land (4,9):
            candidate_ij = 4 * min(9,8)=32 -> candidate_two remains 45

        Then candidate_two=45.

        How do we get 45? It's from the land (9,8) and the previous max_short=5? But wait: when processing (9,8), we have max_short=5 from the previous two lands. Then min(8,5)=5 -> 9*5=45? But the best pair for land (9,8) is with land (10,5): 
            min(long_i, long_j)=min(9,10)=9
            min(short_i, short_j)=min(8,5)=5 -> area=45.

        Also, we can pair (9,8) with (10,1): 
            min(9,10)=9, min(8,1)=1 -> area=9.

        So 45 is the best for land (9,8). But what about pairing (9,8) with (10,5) is the best? 

        However, note: we have a land (10,5) that we processed just before. The max_short we have at the time of (9,8) is 5 (from the last land (10,5)), but actually we also had land (10,1) which had short=1, so the max_short we have is 5. 

        How about the pair (9,8) and (10,5) is covered? Yes.

        But what if we have a land (10,10) and then (9,1)? 
            sorted: [(10,10), (9,1)]
            land1: max_short=10 -> candidate_ij: skip
            land2: candidate_ij=9 * min(1,10)=9 -> candidate_two=9.

        But the pair (10,10) and (9,1): 
            min(long)=min(10,9)=9
            min(short)=min(10,1)=1 -> area=9.

        Also, we can get from the land (10,10) alone: candidate_one=10*10=100 -> then candidate_one/2=50.0 -> which is larger than 9 -> so we output 50.0.

        Therefore, the algorithm is correct.

    However, note: what if the best candidate for two lands is achieved by two lands that both have long_i less than the current? Actually, we are processing in descending order and we update max_short only from the lands we've seen (with long_i>=current). So if we have two lands that are the only ones that together form a large candidate, but both are small? Then we will process the larger one first, then the smaller one. And when processing the smaller one, we use the max_short from the larger one? But the max_short we use for the smaller land is the maximum short among the lands that we've seen (which are the ones with long_i>= the current land's long_i). So if we have two lands: 
        land1: (3,100) -> normalized: (100,3) -> so long=100, short=3.
        land2: (4,50)  -> normalized: (50,4) -> so long=50, short=4.

        Then we sort by long descending: [ (100,3), (50,4) ]
        For land1: update max_short=3 -> candidate_ij: skip
        For land2: candidate_ij = 50 * min(4, max_short=3)=50*3=150 -> candidate_two=150.

        But the best building from the two lands: 
            min(long1,long2)=min(100,50)=50
            min(short1,short2)=min(3,4)=3 -> area=50*3=150.

        Also, note: the single land candidate: 
            land1: 100*3=300 -> 150.0
            land2: 50*4=200 -> 100.0
        So candidate_one=300 -> candidate_one/2=150.0 -> so we compare 150.0 and 150 -> both 150.

        Then we output 150.0? But the problem: we can output 150.0 as "150.0", which is the same as 150.0.

        However, the problem says: output the largest building. Both candidates are 150. Then we can output either? But note: the problem does not care which configuration, we output the building area.

        So we can output 150.0.

        But note: in the condition candidate_one>=2*candidate_two: 300>=2*150 -> 300>=300 -> true -> then we output candidate_one/2=150.0 -> "150.0".

        So that's consistent.

    Therefore, the code is:

        #include <iostream>
        #include <vector>
        #include <algorithm>
        using namespace std;

        int main() {
            ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
            cin.tie(0);
            int n;
            cin >> n;
            vector<pair<long long, long long>> lands; // each: (long, short)
            long long candidate_one = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                long long L, W;
                cin >> L >> W;
                long long long_i = max(L, W);
                long long short_i = min(L, W);
                lands.push_back({long_i, short_i});
                if (long_i * short_i > candidate_one) {
                    candidate_one = long_i * short_i;
                }
            }

            sort(lands.begin(), lands.end(), [](const pair<long long,long long> &a, const pair<long long,long long> &b) {
                return a.first > b.first;
            });

            long long candidate_two = 0;
            long long max_short = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < lands.size(); i++) {
                long long long_i = lands[i].first;
                long long short_i = lands[i].second;
                if (max_short != 0) { // we have seen at least one land
                    long long temp = min(short_i, max_short);
                    long long candidate_ij = long_i * temp;
                    if (candidate_ij > candidate_two) {
                        candidate_two = candidate_ij;
                    }
                }
                if (short_i > max_short) {
                    max_short = short_i;
                }
            }

            if (candidate_one >= 2 * candidate_two) {
                long long half = candidate_one / 2;
                if (candidate_one % 2 == 0) {
                    cout << half << ".0\n";
                } else {
                    cout << half << ".5\n";
                }
            } else {
                cout << candidate_two << ".0\n";
            }
            return 0;
        }

    But note: the condition "max_short != 0" might be improved? Because max_short starts at 0 and we update to at least the first land's short_i. But the first land: we skip candidate_two update. Then for the next lands, we update candidate_two.

    However, if there is only one land? Then candidate_two remains 0. Then we compare candidate_one and 0: candidate_one>=0 -> true -> then we output candidate_one/2.

    So the code handles the case n=1.

    Let me test with n=1: 
        Input: 
            1
            5 5
        candidate_one = 25
        candidate_two = 0 -> then output 25/2 = 12.5 -> "12.5"

    Correct.

    Therefore, we write the code accordingly.

    However, note: what if candidate_two is 0? Then we output candidate_one/2. That is acceptable.

    Let me test with n=0? The problem says n>=1.

    We are safe.

    We use long long for candidate_one and candidate_two because the product can be 10^18.

    Code:

        #include <iostream>
        #include <vector>
        #include <algorithm>
        #include <cctype>
        using namespace std;

        int main() {
            ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
            cin.tie(0);
            int n;
            cin >> n;
            vector<pair<long long, long long>> lands;
            long long candidate_one = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                long long L, W;
                cin >> L >> W;
                long long long_i = max(L, W);
                long long short_i = min(L, W);
                lands.push_back({long_i, short_i});
                candidate_one = max(candidate_one, long_i * short_i);
            }

            sort(lands.begin(), lands.end(), [](const auto& a, const auto& b) {
                return a.first > b.first;
            });

            long long candidate_two = 0;
            long long max_short = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                long long long_i = lands[i].first;
                long long short_i = lands[i].second;
                if (i > 0) {  // We can use i>0 to indicate we have seen at least one land? Or use max_short>0? Actually, we set max_short=0 initially, then update after the first land. But for the first land, we skip candidate_two update and then update max_short to the first land's short_i. Then for the next lands we do candidate_two update. Alternatively, we can do:
                    long long temp = min(short_i, max_short);
                    candidate_two = max(candidate_two, long_i * temp);
                }
                if (short_i > max_short) {
                    max_short = short_i;
                }
            }

            if (candidate_one >= 2 * candidate_two) {
                if (candidate_one % 2 == 0) {
                    cout << candidate_one / 2 << ".0\n";
                } else {
                    cout << candidate_one / 2 << ".5\n";
                }
            } else {
                cout << candidate_two << ".0\n";
            }
            return 0;
        }

    However, the above loop for candidate_two: we start i=0, then for the first land (i=0) we skip candidate_two update? Actually, we skip because i>0 is false. Then we update max_short. Then for i=1, we use max_short from the previous land.

    But what if we have two lands? Then we process the first land: skip candidate_two update, then update max_short. Then the second land: i=1 (so we do candidate_two update) and then update max_short.

    This is the same as the previous condition (max_short != 0) because after the first land, max_short becomes nonzero.

    But note: what if the first land has short_i=0? Then the condition max_short!=0 fails? But the problem states: L_i, W_i>=1 -> so short_i>=1.

    Therefore, we can use either condition.

    Let me change to condition: if (i>0). It's equivalent.

    But note: the condition in the original algorithm was "if max_short>0", and we update max_short only to positive values? And the first land: we update max_short to a positive value. Then the next land: we have max_short>0 -> true.

    So we can write:

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i > 0) {
                long long temp = min(lands[i].second, max_short);
                candidate_two = max(candidate_two, lands[i].first * temp);
            }
            if (lands[i].second > max_short) {
                max_short = lands[i].second;
            }
        }

    This is equivalent.

    However, we can also avoid the branch by initializing max_short to lands[0].second and then starting the loop from i=1? But then we miss the candidate_two from the first land? Actually, the first land doesn't produce a candidate_two (needs two lands). So we can do:

        if (n > 0) {
            max_short = lands[0].second;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            long long temp = min(lands[i].second, max_short);
            candidate_two = max(candidate_two, lands[i].first * temp);
            if (lands[i].second > max_short) {
                max_short = lands[i].second;
            }
        }

    But then we have to initialize candidate_two to 0. And if n==0? The problem says n>=1, so we can do:

        if (n == 0) {
            // but n>=1, so skip.
        }

    We'll stick to the first loop.

    Final code:
