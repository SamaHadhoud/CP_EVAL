 We are going to follow the editorial exactly.

 Steps:
 1. Read input: n, m, q and initial array A.
 2. Note that Randall's performance is A[0] (we call it A0).
 3. Precompute F1: the number of initial employees with performance < A0.

 4. For each year i (from 1 to m):
    - Read R_i and the list B_i of R_i integers.
    - Precompute for each year i: G_i = number of new employees in year i that have performance < A0.

 5. We define:
      H[1] = F1
      For t from 2 to m+1: H[t] = H[t-1] + G_{t-1} - R_{t-1}

    However, note that we have m years. We are going to consider years 1 to m.

    Condition for year t: At the beginning of year t, we have H[t] employees worse than Randall. Then we replace R_t worst employees. The condition for Randall to survive year t is: H[t] >= R_t.

    So we define for year t (from 1 to m): D_t = H[t] - R_t.

    But note: H[t] is defined at the start of year t. We have m years, so we need to check for t=1 to t=m.

 6. We build an array D of length m: 
        D[0] = H[1] - R_1   (for year 1)
        D[1] = H[2] - R_2   (for year 2)
        ... 

    How to compute H for each year?
        H[1] = F1.
        H[2] = H[1] + G_1 - R_1
        H[3] = H[2] + G_2 - R_2 = F1 + (G_1 - R_1) + (G_2 - R_2)

    Actually, we can compute D_t without storing H explicitly? But we need to update when G_i changes.

    However, note: when we update one element in B_X, we only change G_X. This change will affect H for years X+1 to m (and hence D for years X to m?).

    Actually, let's break down the dependencies:

        H[1] = F1 -> fixed.

        For t>=2: 
          H[t] = F1 + (G_1 - R_1) + (G_2 - R_2) + ... + (G_{t-1} - R_{t-1])

        Then for year t (which uses H[t] and R_t), we have:
          D_t = H[t] - R_t = F1 + (G_1 - R_1) + ... + (G_{t-1} - R_{t-1}) - R_t.

        But note: the condition for year t is D_t>=0.

        However, we also note that the change in G_X (say by delta) will affect:
          H[X+1], H[X+2], ... H[m] (and beyond, but we only go to m) by adding delta.

        Then D for:
          year X:   D_X = H[X] - R_X -> H[X] is not affected (because G_X is used in H[X+1] and beyond) -> so D_X is not affected by G_X?
          year X+1: D_{X+1} = H[X+1] - R_{X+1} -> H[X+1] = ... + G_X ... -> so we add delta to H[X+1] and thus to D_{X+1}.
          year t (>=X+1): D_t gets increased by delta.

        Therefore, updating G_X by delta requires adding delta to D_t for t from X+1 to m? But note:

          Actually, H[X] is computed without G_X? Yes, because H[X] = F1 + ... (only up to G_{X-1}) so G_X doesn't appear in H[X]. 
          It appears in H[X+1] and beyond.

        Therefore, the update to G_X affects D for years from X+1 to m? But wait: what about D_X? 
          D_X = H[X] - R_X -> independent of G_X -> so no change.

        So we need to update the segment tree for indices [X, m-1]? Actually, our array D is indexed by year t from 1 to m (as index 0 to m-1).

          D[0] (year1): H[1]-R_1 -> independent of G_1? Actually, no: note that H[1] is fixed, but what about G_1? 
          But H[1] does not include any G_1. Then how is D_1 defined? 
          Condition for year 1: at the start of year 1 we have H[1] worse employees. Then we replace R_1 employees. So we require H[1] >= R_1 -> D_1 = H[1] - R_1.

          Then for year 2: D_2 = H[2] - R_2 = (H[1] + G_1 - R_1) - R_2.

          So if we update G_1, then D_2 and beyond are affected.

        Therefore, for an update in year X, we update D for indices from X (which corresponds to year X+1?) to m-1? 

        Actually, let t be the year index in D (0-indexed for the array D) representing year (t+1). 
          D[0] = year1: H[1]-R_1 -> not affected by any G_i (since H[1] is fixed and R_1 is fixed).
          D[1] = year2: H[2]-R_2 = (H[1] + G_1 - R_1) - R_2 -> affected by G_1.
          D[2] = year3: H[3]-R_3 = (H[1] + G_1 - R_1 + G_2 - R_2) - R_3 -> affected by G_1 and G_2.

        So if we update G_X, then we must update D for indices from X to m-1? 
          Because D[X] (which is year X+1) is the first D that includes G_X? 
          Actually, D[X] = H[X+1] - R_{X+1} = (H[1] + ... + (G_X - R_X)) - R_{X+1}. 
          So yes, we update D for indices from X to m-1.

        But note: our array D has m elements: 
          D[0] for year1, D[1] for year2, ... D[m-1] for year m.

        Therefore, when updating G_X (with delta), we update the segment tree for D from index = X (which affects year X+1) to index = m-1 (the last year) by adding delta.

        However, note: if X = m, then we update from index m to m-1? -> which is an empty range? Then we don't update.

        So update range: [X, m-1] only if X <= m-1.

 7. We build a segment tree (with lazy propagation) that supports:
        - Range update: add a delta to a contiguous range of D.
        - Query the global minimum of D.

    Then for each scenario, after updating one new employee in year X, we change G_X by delta (which is either -1, 0, or 1). Then we update the segment tree for the range [X, m-1] by adding delta (if the range is non-empty).

    Then we check: if the global minimum of D (over all m years) is >= 0, then Randall survives (output 1), else output 0.

 8. Important: The initial D array:

        Let H1 = F1 (number of initial employees worse than Randall).

        Then for year1: D0 = H1 - R_1.

        Then H2 = H1 + G_1 - R_1.

        Then for year2: D1 = H2 - R_2 = H1 + G_1 - R_1 - R_2? -> but wait, the formula is H[2] = H1 + (G_1 - R_1) -> then D1 = H2 - R_2 = H1 + G_1 - R_1 - R_2.

        But actually, the condition for year2: at the beginning of year2 we have H2 employees worse than Randall. Then we remove R_2 employees (the worst R_2). So we require H2>=R_2 -> so D1 = H2 - R_2.

        How do we compute the entire D array?

          Let:
            D[0] = H1 - R_1
            D[1] = (H1 + G_1 - R_1) - R_2
            D[2] = (H1 + G_1 - R_1 + G_2 - R_2) - R_3
            ...

        Alternatively, we can precompute:

          H = [0]*(m+2)
          H[1] = F1
          for i in range(1, m+1):
              H[i+1] = H[i] + G_current[i] - R_arr[i]

          Then D[i] = H[i+1] - R_arr[i+1]? -> No, because we have m years. Actually:

          We have m years. For year i (i from 1 to m), we have:
            Start: H[i] (number of worse employees at the start of year i)
            Then we remove R_i employees -> condition: H[i] >= R_i -> so D_i = H[i] - R_i.

          And then at the end of year i, we add G_i new worse employees? Actually, we add the new employees and then the new set has:
            H[i] - R_i + G_i = H[i+1] (which is the start of next year).

          So the condition for year i is D_i = H[i] - R_i >= 0.

          Therefore, we define for i from 1 to m:
            D[i-1] = H[i] - R_i   (so D[0] for year1, D[1] for year2? Actually: for year i, we use D index i-1).

          How to compute H for the years? 
            H[1] = F1
            H[2] = H[1] - R_1 + G_1
            H[3] = H[2] - R_2 + G_2

          Then for year i: condition is H[i] - R_i >= 0 -> which is D[i-1] = H[i] - R_i.

          But note: the update: when we change G_i (for year i), then it affects H[i+1], H[i+2], ... 
          Therefore, it affects D for:
            D_i = H[i+1] - R_{i+1] -> because for year i+1 we have H[i+1] at the start -> so D_i = H[i+1]-R_{i+1] is affected.
            and also D_{i+1] = H[i+2]-R_{i+2] is affected, etc.

          Actually, the update to G_i (say by delta) will cause:
            H[i+1] becomes H[i+1] + delta
            Then D_i = H[i+1] - R_{i+1] becomes (H[i+1] + delta) - R_{i+1] = D_i + delta.

            Then H[i+2] = H[i+1] (which now has the delta) - R_{i+1] + G_{i+1] -> so H[i+2] also gets the delta -> then D_{i+1] = H[i+2] - R_{i+2] = (old D_{i+1]) + delta.

          Therefore, the entire suffix of D (from index i to the end) gets updated by delta.

          And note: D has m elements: 
            index0: year1 -> D0 = H[1] - R_1 -> fixed? (because H[1] and R_1 are fixed) -> not affected by any G_i for i>=1.
            index1: year2 -> D1 = H[2] - R_2 = (H[1] - R_1 + G_1) - R_2 -> affected by G_1.

          So if we update G_1, we update D from index1 to m-1? 
            Actually, the D array has indices 0 to m-1. 
            Year1: index0 -> not affected by G_1.
            Year2: index1 -> affected by G_1.
            Year3: index2 -> also affected by G_1.

          So update: from index = 1 to m-1.

          In general: when updating year i (so G_i changes), we update D from index = i to m-1? 
            Because D_i (which is the condition for year i+1) is the first D that includes G_i? 
            Actually, the condition for year i+1 is at index i (0-indexed).

          Therefore, we update the segment tree for D indices [i, m-1] by delta.

          Example: 
            i=1 -> update indices [1, m-1] (if m>=2)

          But note: what if i = m? Then the update range is [m, m-1] -> which is empty -> so no update.

 9. Steps:

        Precomputation:
          F1 = count of initial employees < A0.

          R_arr[1..m] and B_arr[1..m] (arrays for each year, 1-indexed for years).

          G_current[1..m]: for each year i, count the new employees in B_i that are < A0.

          Then compute H[1..m] (for the start of each year) and then D[0..m-1] for the conditions.

          Actually, we don't need H for every year? We only need D.

          Alternatively, we can compute D[0] = H[1] - R_1 = F1 - R_1.

          Then for i from 1 to m-1 (so for D index i, which is condition for year i+1):
              D[i] = (H[1] - R_1 + (G_1 - R_2) + ...? -> Actually, we can compute:

          Instead, we can compute:

            D[0] = F1 - R_1
            D[1] = F1 - R_1 + G_1 - R_2
            D[2] = F1 - R_1 + G_1 - R_2 + G_2 - R_3

          But note: condition for year1: D0 = F1 - R_1.
          condition for year2: D1 = F1 - R_1 + G_1 - R_2.

          Actually, we can write:

            D[i] = F1 - (R_1 + R_2 + ... + R_{i+1}) + (G_1 + G_2 + ... + G_i)

          However, we don't need the entire array to be built that way? We can build:

            Let S = F1
            D0 = S - R_1
            Then update S = S - R_1 + G_1   -> then D1 = S - R_2
            Then update S = S - R_2 + G_2   -> then D2 = S - R_3

          So:

            D = []
            S = F1
            for i in range(1, m+1):
                S = S - R_i
                D.append(S)   # This is for year i: condition is S>=0? But note: the condition for year i is that we have S (which is H[i] - R_i) but actually H[i] is the state at the start, then we subtract R_i -> and then we add G_i to get the next state? 
                Then we do: S += G_i   # to get H[i+1] for next year.

          However, note: the condition for year i is that after the removal we still have at least one Randall? Actually, the condition is that we do not remove Randall. And we remove the R_i worst. So we require that the number of employees worse than Randall at the start (H[i]) is at least R_i -> so D_i = H[i] - R_i >= 0.

          But in our loop we did:
            S = H[i] (the state at the start of year i)
            Then we subtract R_i -> becomes H[i] - R_i -> which is D_{i-1}? 

          Actually, we want D for year i to be H[i] - R_i.

          So we can build the D array as:

            D = [0]*m
            S = F1
            for i in range(0, m):   # i from 0 to m-1: representing year i+1
                # S is H[i+1] (the start of year i+1) -> for the first iteration: i=0, then S = F1 = H[1] (start of year1)
                D[i] = S - R_arr[i+1]   # because R for year i+1 is R_arr[i+1]
                # Then we update S to the start of next year: 
                S = S - R_arr[i+1] + G_current[i+1]   # so H[i+2] = S

          Then the condition for year i+1 is D[i] >= 0.

 10. Then we build the segment tree over the array D (of length m).

 11. For each query:

        (X, Y, Z): update the new employee in year X at position Y to Z.

        Let the old value = old_val, and new value = Z.

        How does G_X change?
            old_contrib = 1 if old_val < A0 else 0
            new_contrib = 1 if Z < A0 else 0
            delta = new_contrib - old_contrib

        Then we update G_current[X] += delta.

        Then we update the segment tree: we add delta to the segment of D from index = X-1? to m-1? 

        But note: 
          The update to G_X (year X) will affect the state for the start of year X+1 and beyond. Therefore, it will affect the condition for year X+1 (D index = X) and beyond.

          Specifically, the D array:
            D[0] -> year1: not affected by G_X (if X>=1, then X>=1, so index0 is safe? unless X=1?).
            For D index i: 
               if i < X-1: not affected? 
               Actually, the condition for year i+1 is computed with G_1, G_2, ... up to G_i.

            Therefore, if we update G_X, then it affects D for indices from X to m-1? 
               Because the condition for year X+1: D[X] = ... (and it includes G_X) -> and beyond.

          How are the indices?
            Year1: D[0] -> uses no G, only F1 and R_1 -> so if X>=1, then D[0] is independent.
            Year2: D[1] -> uses G_1 -> so if X=1, then we update D[1] and beyond.

          Therefore, we update the segment tree for D indices from X to m-1? 
            Because if we update G_X, then the first D that includes it is D[X] (which is the condition for year X+1) and then all subsequent D.

          However, note: 
            D[X] = (H[X+1] - R_{X+1]) 
            and H[X+1] = ... + G_X ... 

          But note: our D array index for year i is i-1. Therefore, for year X+1, the D index is X.

          So update: 
            if X <= m-1, then update indices [X, m-1] by delta.

          But what if X = m? Then we are updating the last year? Then the condition for year m+1? We don't have that. We only have m years. 
          And note: the update to G_m affects the state for the start of year m+1? but we don't check that year. 
          However, note: the condition for year m is D[m-1] = H[m] - R_m -> which does not include G_m. 

          Why? 
            H[m] = F1 + (G_1 - R_1) + ... + (G_{m-1} - R_{m-1])
            Then D[m-1] = H[m] - R_m -> does not include G_m.

          Therefore, G_m is only used to compute H[m+1] which is beyond the m years? and we don't have a condition for that.

          So the update to G_m does not affect any D? -> so we don't update the segment tree.

          Therefore, we update the segment tree only for indices [X, m-1] if X <= m-1.

          Example: 
            If m=3, then D has indices 0,1,2:
                D[0]: year1 -> condition: H[1]-R_1 -> independent of any G -> so update for X>=1: we start at index X? 
                But if X=1: update indices [1,2] -> that's D[1] and D[2] -> which are year2 and year3.

          So the update: 
            if X >= 1 and X <= m-1: update [X, m-1] by delta.

          However, note: our years in the input are 1-indexed: the first year is year1, then year2, ... year m.

          In the D array: 
            D[0] = year1 condition -> not affected by any G_i.
            D[1] = year2 condition -> affected by G_1? -> yes, and if we update G_1, then we update starting at index1? -> which is D[1] -> which is year2.

          But wait: the update to G_1: 
            It appears in the computation of H[2] (start of year2) and then D[1] = H[2] - R_2.

          How do we compute D[1]? 
            H[2] = H[1] - R_1 + G_1 -> so D[1] = H[2] - R_2 = (H[1]-R_1) + G_1 - R_2.

          So if we update G_1 by delta, then D[1] becomes D[1] + delta, and also D[2] = H[3] - R_3 = (H[2]-R_2+G_2) - R_3 = (H[1]-R_1+G_1-R_2+G_2) - R_3 -> so if we change G_1 by delta, then D[2] also becomes D[2] + delta.

          Therefore, we update the entire suffix from index1 to the end? 

          But note: the condition for year1 (D[0]) is independent.

          Therefore, the update for G_X: we update the segment tree for the D indices from X to m-1? 
            Actually, the first D that includes G_X is D[X] (for year X+1). However, note:

            Our D array index i (0-indexed) corresponds to year i+1.

            And the update to G_X: it appears in H[X+1] (start of year X+1) and then in all subsequent H. Therefore, it appears in D[X] (which is for year X+1: D[X]=H[X+1]-R_{X+1]), and then D[X+1] (year X+2) and so on.

          So we update D indices [X, m-1] by adding delta.

          But note: our D array has m elements: indices 0 to m-1. 
          For X (the year index, 1-indexed) we update D indices from X to m-1? 
            For example, if we update G_1 (X=1) -> then we update D[1]? But wait: 
              D[0] = year1 -> independent of G_1 -> index0 not updated.
              D[1] = year2 -> uses G_1 -> so we update index1? 
              D[2] = year3 -> uses G_1 -> so we update index2.

          But note: the condition for year2 is at D index1? 
          Actually, the condition for year2 is at D index1? -> then we are updating the condition for year2 and beyond.

          Therefore, we update the segment tree for D indices from X (the year index) to m-1? 
            But note: the condition for year2 is the second condition? and we are updating the condition for year2? -> so we update index1.

          How do we map the year X to the D index? 
            Condition for year i is stored at D[i-1]? 
            But the update to G_X: it affects the condition for year X+1, which is stored at D[X] (if we consider 0-indexed: index = X) -> because:
                year1 -> D[0]
                year2 -> D[1]
                year3 -> D[2]
                ...
                year i -> D[i-1]

            Condition for year X+1: D[X] (0-indexed).

          Therefore, we update the segment tree for indices [X, m-1] -> meaning starting at index = X (which corresponds to year X+1) to the last condition (year m, at index m-1).

          But note: if X = m, then we update from index m to m-1 -> which is invalid? 
          Actually, if we update G_m, then it affects the state for the start of year m+1? but we don't have a condition for year m+1? 
          Therefore, we do nothing? 

          So update only if X < m? -> then indices [X, m-1] is non-empty only if X <= m-1.

          Therefore, we do:
            if (X < m) -> update the segment tree for indices [X, m-1] by delta.

          But wait: what if X==m? then we skip.

 12. After updating the segment tree, we check the global minimum of the entire D array. If the global min >=0, then Randall survives (output 1), else output 0.

 13. Special case: m=0 -> no years? Then Randall is always there? Then output 1 for every scenario.

 Implementation:

        Steps:

          Read n, m, q.
          A: n integers.

          A0 = A[0]

          F1 = 0;
          for i in range(n):
              if A[i] < A0: F1++

          R_arr: 1-indexed: R_arr[i] for i in [1, m]
          B_arr: 1-indexed: B_arr[i] for i in [1, m] (each is a list of R_arr[i] integers)

          Precompute G_current[1..m] (1-indexed) for each year i: 
            for each value in B_arr[i]: if value < A0 -> count++.

          Precompute the D array (length = m) for the conditions of each year.

          How to compute D?
            Let S = F1   // H[1] = F1
            D_arr = [0] * m   // for years 1..m: condition for year i is stored at D_arr[i-1]
            for i in range(1, m+1):
                // Condition for year i: at the start we have S employees worse than Randall -> condition: S >= R_arr[i]
                D_arr[i-1] = S - R_arr[i]   // condition for year i
                // Then update S for the next year: remove R_arr[i] worst and add G_current[i] new worse ones? 
                // Actually, the next year starts with: S - R_arr[i] + G_current[i]
                S = S - R_arr[i] + G_current[i]

          Then build a segment tree (min tree) for D_arr.

          For each query:

            Read X, Y, Z.

            Year = X, position = Y (1-indexed in the B_arr[X] array) -> index in the list: Y-1.

            old_val = B_arr[X][Y-1]
            new_val = Z

            old_contrib = (old_val < A0) ? 1 : 0
            new_contrib = (Z < A0) ? 1 : 0
            delta = new_contrib - old_contrib

            If delta != 0:
                Update G_current[X] += delta   // because we are replacing one value: if we remove an employee that was worse and put one that is not, then we subtract 1? or add if the new is worse and the old wasn't.

                Then update the segment tree: 
                  if (X < m) {  // because if X==m, then no condition is affected (we only have conditions for years 1..m, and G_X only affects the next year which we don't condition on)
                    seg_tree.update_range(X, m-1, delta);   // update the segment of D_arr from index X to m-1? 
                  }

                Also update B_arr[X][Y-1] = Z   // because the next query might see the change

            Then check: 
                min_val = seg_tree.query(0, m-1)   // or we can store the global min in the root? we'll have a function to get the root.

            if min_val >= 0: output 1
            else: output 0

 14. However, note: what if m=0? Then we have no D_arr? Then we skip building the segment tree? Then for every query, we output 1.

 15. Implementation of segment tree with lazy propagation for range add and range min query.

 16. Note: the constraints: m, q up to 100,000 -> so the segment tree must be efficient.

 17. Let's code accordingly.

 18. Important: The total sum of R_i <= 10^6 -> so we can precompute G_current in O(total_R) which is 10^6.

 Implementation in C++:

        Steps:

          #include <bits/stdc++.h>
          using namespace std;

          typedef long long ll;

          struct SegmentTree {
            vector<ll> tree;
            vector<ll> lazy;
            int n, size;

            SegmentTree(vector<ll>& data, int n) : n(n) {
                size = 1;
                while (size < n) size *= 2;
                tree.assign(2*size, (ll)1e18);
                lazy.assign(2*size, 0);
                for (int i=0; i<n; i++) tree[size+i] = data[i];
                for (int i=size-1; i>=1; i--) tree[i] = min(tree[2*i], tree[2*i+1]);
            }

            void apply(int node, ll delta) {
                tree[node] += delta;
                if (node < size) {
                    lazy[node] += delta;
                }
            }

            void push(int node) {
                if (lazy[node] != 0) {
                    apply(2*node, lazy[node]);
                    apply(2*node+1, lazy[node]);
                    lazy[node] = 0;
                }
            }

            void update_range(int l, int r, ll delta, int node, int segL, int segR) {
                if (r < segL || segR < l) return;
                if (l <= segL && segR <= r) {
                    apply(node, delta);
                    return;
                }
                push(node);
                int mid = (segL + segR) / 2;
                update_range(l, r, delta, 2*node, segL, mid);
                update_range(l, r, delta, 2*node+1, mid+1, segR);
                tree[node] = min(tree[2*node], tree[2*node+1]);
            }

            void update(int l, int r, ll delta) {

                push(node);

            ll global_min() {
                return tree[1];   // the root? but note: we have lazy in the root? we need to push? 
                // Alternatively, we can query the entire range.
                // But our segment tree is built such that the root is the min? but if there are lazy at root we have already applied? 
                // Actually, we don't push the root in the update? we only push when we go down. The root might have lazy? 
                // So better to do: query(0, n-1) if n>0, else 0?
                // However, we have a function that doesn't require pushing for the root? 
                // Since we are storing the lazy at the root, and the root is the entire segment, then the root's lazy is applied to the entire tree? 
                // Actually, the root's lazy is stored in the lazy[1] and also the tree[1] has the updated value? because in apply we update the tree and then set lazy for non-leaf? 
                // So tree[1] is the min for the entire tree? 
                // But if we update the entire tree, we update the root and set lazy[1] to the delta? and then when we query, we don't push the root? 
                // Actually, in the update_range we don't push the root? we only push when we go down? 
                // So if we never go down, the root is updated and the lazy is set? and then when we return we don't update the parent? 
                // But the root is the parent of the entire tree? 
                // How about: we return tree[1]? 
                // However, if we have lazy at the root, then the entire tree has been updated? but the root's value is the updated value? because we did apply(node, delta) which does: tree[node] += delta? 
                // Then we set lazy for the root? and that lazy is for the entire segment? but then the children are not updated? 
                // Actually, the root's value is the min of the entire segment? and we updated it by delta? so the root's value is the updated min? 
                // The lazy in the root is only for propagation if we update a sub-interval later? 
                // But the children are not updated? 
                // However, if we do a global min, we are only interested in the root? and we have updated the root? 
                // But if we update the entire range [0, n-1] by delta, then we update the root by delta? and then set lazy[1] = delta? (if the root is non-leaf) -> but the root is non-leaf? 
                // Actually, the root (node=1) has children? and we don't push the lazy to the children? 
                // Then the root's value is the updated min? and the children are not updated? but that is okay? 
                // But if we then update a sub-interval, we will push the lazy from the root? 
                // So for global_min? we can return tree[1]? 
                // However, we are only updating by ranges? and then we might have lazy at the root? but the root's tree value is the updated value? 
                // So we can do: 
                return tree[1];
                // But note: if we update a sub-interval that does not cover the entire segment, we might have updated the root by the lazy? and then the root is the min of the updated children? but if we don't push, the children are not updated? 
                // Therefore, we should not rely on tree[1] for the global min? 
                // Instead, we can do: 
                //   return query(0, n-1);
                // But that is O(n)? -> actually O(log n) because of the segment tree.

                // Alternatively, we can avoid the recursive query by having the root stored? 
                // But our segment tree with lazy propagation: the root is updated? but the children might be outdated? 
                // However, the root's value is the current min? because every time we update, we update the entire path? 

                // Actually, in our update_range: we update the entire segment by adding delta? and we update the root? so the root is the min of the entire segment? 
                // Then we set lazy? for the children? but we don't update the children? but the root's value is the updated value? 
                // Then if we return the root, it is the updated min? 
                // However, if we update a sub-interval, then we update the root? 
                // Actually, the segment tree update_range updates the entire segment by updating the root? and then we set the lazy for the root? 
                // Then the root is the min of the entire segment? 

                // But if we update a sub-interval that does not cover the entire segment, we push the lazy? and then update the children? and then update the root? 
                // So the root is always the min? 

                // Therefore, we can return tree[1]? 

                // However, to be safe, let's do: 
                //   return query(0, n-1);
                // But that is O(4*log(n))? which is acceptable.

                // Given the constraints (m, q up to 100000), and each query does one update (which is O(log n)) and then a global min query that is O(log n) -> that is acceptable.

                // But note: we are updating a suffix and then querying the entire tree? we can also store the root value? 

                // We'll do: 
                //   return query(0, n-1);
            }
          };

          However, note: the global_min function in the sample python code just returns the root? 
          But our segment tree in the push and update maintains the root as the min? 

          Alternatively, we can note that the root (node1) has the min for the entire tree? even if there is lazy? 
          Because when we update a node that covers the entire segment, we update the root and set lazy? 
          When we update a part, we update the root? 

          Actually, the root's value is always the min of the entire segment? because we update it during the update? 
          But wait: if we update a sub-interval, we update the root? 
          Actually, in update_range: 
            if the segment [segL, segR] is covered, we update the node and set lazy for children? and then return? 
            Then we update the parent by min(tree[2*i], tree[2*i+1])? -> but that is done after the recursive update? 

          So the root is updated? 

          Therefore, we can simply return tree[1] for the global min? 

          But note: if we have lazy in the root? the root's lazy is stored? but the root's tree value has been updated? 
          So we return tree[1].

          However, let me test: 
            Initially: tree[1] = min of the entire array? -> yes.

            Then we update a suffix: we update the entire suffix by adding delta? 
            When updating the root? we update the entire root? then the root's value is updated? 

          Therefore, we change the global_min to:

            return tree[1];

          But note: if we update a suffix that does not cover the entire segment? 
            Example: update [l, r] that is a strict subset of [0, n-1]. 
            Then we push the root? and then go down? 
            Then we update the children? and then update the root? so tree[1] is updated? 

          So it is safe.

                    B_arr[X][pos] = Z;
                }

                // Now check: if the global min of D_arr is >=0 then Randall survives
                if (m == 0) {
                    out_lines.push_back("1");
                } else {
                    ll min_val = seg_tree->global_min();   // we have defined global_min to return tree[1]
                    if (min_val >= 0) {
                        out_lines.push_back("1");
                    } else {
                        out_lines.push_back("0");
                    }
                }
            }

            for (string& s : out_lines) {
                cout << s << '\n';
            }
          }

 20. But note: the segment tree global_min returns tree[1]? 

          We must check: in the segment tree, after an update, the root is updated? 
          Yes, because in update_range we update the root if the segment is covered? and if not, we push and then update the children and then update the root? 

          However, what if the entire segment is updated by a lazy value? then the root has the updated min? 

          But also note: if we update a suffix that is the entire segment? then we update the root? and set lazy? but the root's tree value is updated? 

          Therefore, we can trust tree[1]? 

 21. However, there is a catch: the segment tree we built has a size that is a power of two? and the array D_arr is of length m? 
          The segment tree array has indices from 0 to size-1, but we only care about the first m? 
          How do we handle the rest? 
          We initialized the segment tree with:
            for i in [0, m-1]: tree[size+i] = data[i]
            for i in [m, size-1]: we set to 1e18? -> then the min for the entire segment might be 1e18? 
          But we are building the tree by:
            for (int i=size-1; i>=1; i--) tree[i] = min(tree[2*i], tree[2*i+1]);

          Then the root is the min of the entire array? including the padded 1e18? 

          However, we are only going to query the first m elements? and the updates only touch indices [0, m-1]? 
          Then the min for the entire array (including the padded) might be the min of the first m? 
          But if the entire D_arr is non-negative, then the padded 1e18 doesn't matter? 
          But if there is a negative in the first m, then the min is that negative? 

          How about: we build the segment tree only for the first m? and the rest (if any) are set to 1e18? which is a big number? so they won't affect the min? 

          So it's safe.

 22. Let's test with sample:

        Input: 
          5 3 3
          50 40 30 20 10
          4 1 2 3 100
          1 4
          2 6 7
          1 3 300
          2 1 400
          2 1 5

        Steps:

          A0 = 50
          F1 = count of [40,30,20,10] that are < 50 -> 4.

          Year1: R1=4, B1=[1,2,3,100] -> G1 = count of values in B1 that are < 50: all 4? -> 4.
          Year2: R2=1, B2=[4] -> G2 = (4<50) -> 1.
          Year3: R3=2, B3=[6,7] -> G3 = 2 (both <50).

          Compute D_arr:

            Year1: D0 = F1 - R1 = 4 - 4 = 0.
            Then update: S = 4 - 4 + G1 = 0+4 = 4.

            Year2: D1 = S - R2 = 4 - 1 = 3.
            Then update: S = 4 - 1 + G2 = 3+1=4.

            Year3: D2 = S - R3 = 4 - 2 = 2.

          Then D_arr = [0, 3, 2] -> min is 0 -> non-negative -> output 1 for the first scenario? 

          But the sample output for the first scenario is 1 -> matches.

          Then the first scenario: 
            Query: 1 3 300 -> update B1[2] (0-indexed index=2) from 3 to 300.

            old_val=3 -> was counted in G1? -> yes (because 3<50) -> old_contrib=1.
            new_val=300 -> 300>=50? -> new_contrib=0.
            delta = 0-1 = -1.

            Then update G1: from 4 to 3.

            Then update the segment tree: X=1, which is < m (m=3) -> so update indices [1, 2] by -1.

            Then D_arr becomes: 
                [0, 3-1=2, 2-1=1] -> min=0 -> output 1 -> matches.

          Second scenario: 
            Query: 2 1 400 -> update B2[0] (year2, the first element) from 4 to 400.

            old_val=4 -> <50 -> old_contrib=1.
            new_val=400 -> >=50 -> new_contrib=0.
            delta = -1.

            Update G2: from 1 to 0.

            Then update the segment tree: X=2, which is < m? (m=3) -> update indices [2,2] by -1.

            Then D_arr becomes: [0, 2, 1-1=0] -> min=0 -> output 1? 

            But the sample output for the second scenario is 0? 

          Why? 

          Let's simulate:

            Year1: 
              Employees: [50,40,30,20,10] -> worst 4: 10,20,30,40 -> remove them, add [300,100,2,1] -> becomes [300,100,50,2,1] -> Randall is still there? 
            Year2: 
              We update B2: the new employee for year2 is 400 (instead of 4). 
              Remove the worst 1: which is 1 -> then add 400 -> becomes [300,100,50,2,400]? -> wait, but the worst was 1? so remove 1 -> then the set is [300,100,50,2] -> then add 400 -> [300,100,50,2,400]. 
              But then at the start of year3: worse than Randall (50) are: 2 -> only one? 
            Year3: 
              Remove the worst 2: 2 and then 50? -> wait, but 50 is Randall? -> we remove the two worst: 2 and then ... the next worst? 50? -> then Randall is removed.

          Therefore, Randall is gone.

          Why did our D_arr become [0,2,0]? 

          Actually, we must recompute the state:

            After updating G1 to 3 and G2 to 0:

            Year1: 
                D0 = F1 - R1 = 4-4=0 -> condition holds.
                Then the state for year2: F1 - R1 + G1 = 4 - 4 + 3 = 3.

            Year2: 
                Condition: D1 = 3 - R2 = 3-1=2 -> condition holds? 
                Then state for year3: 3 - R2 + G2 = 3-1+0=2.

            Year3: 
                Condition: D2 = 2 - R3 = 2-2=0 -> condition holds? 

          But wait: the condition for year3 is that at the start we have 2 employees worse than Randall? Then we remove 2 employees. 
          So we remove the two worst? which are the two worse employees? and then we add the new employees? 
          The new employees for year3: [6,7] -> both are less than 50? so we add 2 worse? -> then the next year state: 2 - 2 (removed) + 2 (added) = 2? 

          However, the problem is: in year3, we remove the two worst. The two worst employees in the set at the start of year3: 
            The set: [300,100,50,2,400] -> the worst is 2, then 50? 
            But wait: 50 is Randall? and we cannot remove Randall? 

          Actually, the condition is: we require that the number of employees worse than Randall at the start of year3 is at least R3? 
            At the start of year3, we have 2 employees worse than Randall (which are 2 and ...? actually only 2? because 300,100,400 are above 50, and 50 is Randall? 
          So the state for the start of year3 is 1 (only the employee with 2) -> not 2.

          Therefore, our state computation was wrong.

          How did we get state for year3 = 2?

          The state for year2: 
            Start of year2: we have 3 employees worse than Randall? 
            Then we remove R2=1 employee (the worst one) -> so we remove one of the three? leaving 2 worse employees? 
            Then we add G2=0 new worse employees? -> so we have 2 worse employees? 

          But in reality, the set at the start of year2: [300,100,50,2,1] -> the employees worse than Randall: 2 and 1 -> that's two? not three? 

          Why did we compute state for year2 as 3?

          The state for year1: 
            Start of year1: 4 worse employees: [40,30,20,10] -> that's correct.

          Then we remove R1=4 employees? the worst 4? so we remove all four? 
          Then we add G1=3 new employees that are worse? -> so the worse employees at the start of year2: 3? 

          But in reality, we added [1,2,3,100] -> the ones worse than 50: 1,2,3 -> three? so the state for year2 should be 3? 

          Then the set: [50, 100, 1,2,3] -> sorted: 1,2,3,50,100 -> so the employees worse than 50: 1,2,3 -> three.

          Then in year2: 
            We remove the worst 1 employee: which is 1? -> then we add 400? which is not worse? 
            So the state for year3: 
                Start: worse employees: 2 (because we removed one of the three) -> then we add 0 new worse? -> so 2.

          Then the condition for year3: D2 = 2 - 2 = 0 -> condition holds? 

          But in reality, we removed 1 and then added 400 -> the set becomes [50,100,2,3,400]? 
          Actually, no: we remove the worst one (1) and add 400? -> then the set is: [50,100,2,3,400]? 
          Then the employees worse than 50: 2 and 3 -> two? 

          Then in year3: 
            We remove the worst 2: which are 2 and 3? -> then we add 6 and 7? 
            Then the set becomes [50,100,400,6,7]? 
          Then Randall (50) remains.

          So why in the sample output they say he is gone?

          The sample input says:
            For the second scenario, the value of (B_2)_1 is updated to 400, causes the following:

            - Initially: [50,40,30,20,10]
            - After year1: [300,100,50,2,1]   (because we changed B1_3 to 300 in the first scenario, which we kept)
            - After year2: [400,300,100,50,2] -> they say: "the performance of the employees is [400,300,100,50,2]"
            - After year3: [400,300,100,7,6] -> so Randall (50) is gone.

          How did they get [400,300,100,50,2] at the end of year2?

          They updated the new employee in year2 to 400? 
          Then in year2: 
            Remove the worst 1 employee from [300,100,50,2,1] -> the worst is 1? -> remove 1 -> then add 400? -> becomes [300,100,50,2,400]? 
            Then they say [400,300,100,50,2]? -> sorted in descending order? 

          Actually, the problem does not specify the order? but the condition for removal: worst-performing (lowest performance) employees.

          Then at the end of year2, the set is: [300,100,50,2,400]? 
          But then the worst employee is 2? and then 50? 

          Then in year3: 
            Remove the worst 2 employees: 2 and 50? -> then add 6 and 7? -> becomes [300,100,400,6,7] -> and Randall (50) is gone.

          Therefore, the condition for year3: at the start of year3, we have the set [300,100,50,2,400]? 
          The employees worse than 50: only 2 -> one employee? 
          So condition: we require 1>=2? -> fails.

          Therefore, we must have condition for year3: D2 = 1 - 2 = -1 <0.

          How do we compute the state for the start of year3?

          Year2: 
            Start: state = 3 (worse than 50: 1,2,3? -> but note: we had [300,100,50,2,1] -> actually 1 and 2 are the only ones worse? and 3? 
            But wait: 3 is not in the set? 

          How did we get the state for year2 as 3? 

          The state for year1: we started with 4 worse? then we removed 4 and added 3? -> so 3? 
          But the new employees in year1: [1,2,3,100] -> the ones <50: 1,2,3 -> so three? -> so the state for year2 is 3? 

          Then in year2: we remove R2=1 employee? the worst? which is the smallest? -> 1? 
          Then we add 400? which is not worse? -> so the state for year3: 3-1+0 = 2? 

          But in reality, we removed one of the three? so we have two? 

          How do we model the state? 

          The state S for the start of year i is the number of employees worse than Randall? 
          Then we remove the R_i worst employees? which must be taken from the worse employees? if there are at least R_i worse employees? 
          Then the condition is: S_i >= R_i.

          Then the state for next year: 
            S_{i+1} = S_i - R_i + G_i.

          But note: we are assuming that the R_i employees we remove are exactly the R_i worst? and that they are all from the worse group? 
          This is true as long as we have at least R_i worse employees? 

          However, if we don't have at least R_i worse employees? then we remove some that are better? including possibly Randall? 
          But the condition is that we require S_i>=R_i? so we never remove a non-worse employee? 

          Therefore, the recurrence holds.

          But in the sample, the state for year3: 
            S3 = S2 - R2 + G2 = 3 - 1 + 0 = 2.

          Then the condition for year3: D2 = S3 - R3? -> no, the condition for year3 is: 
            At the start of year3: S3 = 2? 
            Then we require S3 >= R3? -> 2>=2 -> holds.

          But in reality, at the start of year3 we only have 1 worse employee? 

          Why the discrepancy? 

          The problem: The state for year2: 
            The set: [300,100,50,2,1] -> the employees worse than 50: 1 and 2 -> that's two? not three? 

          How did we count three? 
          The new employees in year1: [1,2,3,100] -> we said G1=4? but then we updated the third new employee to 300? so the new employees become [1,2,300,100]? 
          Then the worse employees: 1 and 2? -> two? 

          Therefore, in the first scenario update: 
            We updated B1[2] (the third element) from 3 to 300? so the new employees for year1: [1,2,300,100]? 
            Then G1 = count of {1,2,300,100} that are <50? -> 2.

          Then the state for year2: 
            S2 = S1 - R1 + G1 = 4 - 4 + 2 = 2.

          Then condition for year2: D1 = S2 - R2 = 2-1=1 -> holds.

          Then state for year3: 
            S3 = S2 - R2 + G2 = 2-1+ (if G2 is still 1? for the employee 4) -> 1+? 

          Then the second scenario: update year2: B2[0] from 4 to 400 -> then G2 becomes 0? 
          Then S3 = 2-1+0 = 1.

          Then condition for year3: D2 = 1-2 = -1 -> fails.

          Therefore, we must account for the first scenario update in the initial computation? 

          But in the problem: 
            "For the i-th scenario, he will change the value of (B_{X_i})_{Y_i} to Z_i. Note that the changes in each scenario are kept for the subsequent scenarios."

          So we must start with the initial arrays? and then update as we go? 

          However, the initial computation of G_current for year1 was 4? but then the first scenario updates it to 2? 
          Then we built the segment tree with the initial G_current? 

          How to fix:

            We must build the segment tree with the initial B_arr? and then update as we go? 

            But the problem says: the changes are cumulative? so we must start with the given input? and then update? 

            Therefore, we should:

                Read the initial B_arr.

                Then precompute the initial G_current.

                Then build the D_arr and the segment tree.

                Then process the queries: each query updates one value in B_arr? and then we update G_current? and then the segment tree? 

          But in our code we did: 

                for (int i=1; i<=m; i++) {
                    cin >> R_arr[i];
                    B_arr[i].resize(R_arr[i]);
                    for (int j=0; j<R_arr[i]; j++) {
                        cin >> B_arr[i][j];
                        if (B_arr[i][j] < A0) {
                            G_current[i]++;
                        }
                    }
                }

          Then built the D_arr with these G_current.

          Then the first scenario: 
            We update B1[2] to 300? -> then we update G1 from 4 to 3? -> but wait, initially we counted 4? and then we update one element: we remove 3 and put 300? -> so the count becomes 3? 

          But actually, the initial B1 was [1,2,3,100] -> then we update the third element (index2) from 3 to 300? 
          Then the new B1: [1,2,300,100] -> the count should be 2? not 3.

          Why did we update by delta = -1? 

            old_contrib = (3<50) -> 1.
            new_contrib = (300<50) -> 0.
            delta = 0-1 = -1.

            Then G1 becomes 4-1=3? but should be 4-1=3? but actually we removed one that was worse and put one that is not? so we subtract one? -> that is correct? 

          Then why is the state for year2: 4-4+3=3? 

          But the reality: the new employees in year1: [1,2,300,100] -> worse than 50: 1 and 2 -> so 2? 

          The problem: we updated the array, but we didn't update the initial state for the segment tree? 

          How did we build the segment tree? 

            We built the D_arr with the initial G_current (which was 4) -> so D_arr = [0, 4-1=3, 4-2=2]? 

          Then we updated the segment tree: 
            For the first scenario: we updated G1 from 4 to 3? then updated the segment tree for indices [1,2] by -1? -> so D_arr becomes [0,2,1]? 

          But we never updated the state for year2? 

          How should we compute the state for year2? 

            After the update, the state for year2: 
                Start of year2 = F1 - R1 + G1 = 4-4+2=2? 

          But the segment tree update only updated the D_arr for years2 and beyond? 
            We updated D_arr[1] (year2) by -1? and D_arr[2] (year3) by -1? 
          But the condition for year1: D0 = 0? remains.

          Then the condition for year2: D1 = 3? initially? then we subtract 1? becomes 2? 
          Then the condition for year3: D2 = 2? initially? then subtract 1? becomes 1? 

          But we never updated the state for year2? 

          The recurrence for the state is:

            H[1] = F1
            H[2] = H[1] - R1 + G1
            H[3] = H[2] - R2 + G2

          And the conditions: 
            D0 = H[1] - R1
            D1 = H[2] - R2
            D2 = H[3] - R3

          How do we express D1 and D2 in terms of the initial values and updates?

          Initially: 
            D0 = F1 - R1
            D1 = F1 - R1 + G1 - R2
            D2 = F1 - R1 + G1 - R2 + G2 - R3

          When we update G1 by delta1, then D1 becomes: D1 + delta1, and D2 becomes: D2 + delta1.

          When we update G2 by delta2, then D2 becomes: D2 + delta1 + delta2? -> no, only added to the term G2? 
          Actually: 
            D2 = F1 - R1 + G1 - R2 + G2 - R3
            If we update G1 by delta1 and G2 by delta2, then D2 becomes: D2 + delta1 + delta2.

          But in our update: 
            We only do one update at a time? 

          In the first scenario: we update G1 by -1? then we update D1 and D2 by -1? 
          In the second scenario: we update G2 by -1? then we update D2 by -1? -> so D2 becomes 1-1=0? 

          But the state for year3 should be: 
            H[3] = F1 - R1 + G1 - R2 + G2 
                   = 4 - 4 + 3 - 1 + 0 = 2? 
            Then D2 = 2 - 2 = 0? 

          But the reality: the state for year3 is 1? 

          How do we reconcile? 

          The recurrence for the state is linear? 
            H[2] = F1 - R1 + G1
            H[3] = H[2] - R2 + G2

          But after the first scenario: 
            G1 becomes 3 (initially was 4) -> so H[2] = 4-4+3=3.
          Then after the second scenario: 
            G2 becomes 0 (initially was 1) -> so H[3] = 3-1+0=2.

          But the actual count at year3 is 1? 

          The problem: our recurrence does not reflect the actual set? 

          Why? 

          The recurrence is: 
            H[i+1] = H[i] - R_i + G_i

          This recurrence is based on the assumption that the removed R_i employees are taken exclusively from the worse employees? 
          and the new employees worse than Randall are exactly G_i.

          This is valid as long as the condition holds: H[i] >= R_i.

          But what if the condition fails? then we remove some non-worse employees? and then the recurrence breaks? 

          However, in our segment tree, we are checking that D_arr[i] = H[i] - R_i >=0 for every year i? 
          so we assume the recurrence holds? 

          In the sample, after the two updates, we have:

            Year1: D0 = 0 >=0 -> holds.
            Year2: D1 = 3-1=2>=0 -> holds.
            Year3: D2 = 2-2=0>=0 -> holds.

          But the reality: in year3, we only have one worse employee? 

          What is the actual state for year3? 

          Year1: 
            Start: 4 worse employees? 
            Remove 4? then add 3? -> then state for year2: 3 worse employees? 

          Year2: 
            Start: 3 worse employees? 
            Remove 1? then add 0? -> state for year3: 2 worse employees? 

          But the actual set at the start of year3 has only one worse employee? 

          This suggests that the recurrence is not tracking the actual set? 

          Why? 

          The catch: The new employees added in year1: [1,2,300,100] -> the ones worse than Randall: 1 and 2 (only two) -> so we only added two worse employees? 
          Therefore, the state for year2 should be 2? not 3? 

          How did we get 3? 
          We did: G1 = 3? because we counted 1,2, and the initial 3 (which was updated to 300 in the first scenario) as one? 
          But initially, we read the year1 data as [1,2,3,100] and counted 3? -> that was the initial count. 
          Then the first scenario update changed the 3 to 300? so we subtracted one? to get 2? 

          Then the state for year2: 4-4+2=2? 

          Then year2: 
            Condition: D1 = 2-1=1 (holds)
            Then state for year3: 2-1+0 = 1? 

          Then year3: 
            Condition: D2 = 1-2 = -1 (fails)

          Therefore, we must use the updated G_current to compute the initial D_arr? 
          But we built the segment tree with the initial G_current? 

          How to fix: 

          We must start with the initial B_arr? then as we process queries, we update G_current? and also update the segment tree? 

          But we built the segment tree with the initial D_arr? which used the initial G_current? 

          Then when we update G_current for year1? we must also update the entire segment tree for the suffix? 

          In the first scenario: we updated year1? and then updated the segment tree for indices [1,2] by -1? 

          But the initial D_arr for year2 and year3 were computed with the initial G1=4? 
          Then we update by -1? so they become 3 and 2? 

          Then in the second scenario: we update year2? then update the segment tree for year3 by -1? so year3 becomes 2-1=1? 

          But the recurrence for year3: 
            D2 = (F1 - R1 + G1 - R2 + G2) - R3 
                = (4-4+3-1+0) -2 = (3-1+0)-2 = 2-2 = 0? 

          But we have updated year3 in the segment tree twice: 
            First: from year1 update: subtract 1.
            Second: from year2 update: subtract 1.

          So the value becomes: initial_value -1 -1 = 2 -1 -1 = 0? 

          And then we check: 0>=0 -> holds? 

          But the reality: the state for year3 is 1? and the condition fails? 

          The recurrence in the editorial: 
            D_t = F1 - \sum_{i=1}^{t} R_i + \sum_{i=1}^{t-1} G_i

          For year3: 
            D2 = F1 - (R1+R2+R3) + (G1+G2) 
                = 4 - (4+1+2) + (3+0) = 4-7+3 = 0.

          But the actual condition for year3 is not just this formula? 

          The condition for year3 is: 
            At the start of year3: the number of worse employees = F1 - R1 + G1 - R2 + G2 = 4-4+3-1+0 = 2? 
            Then we require at least R3=2? -> 2>=2? holds.

          Why then in the simulation, the number of worse employees at the start of year3 is 1? 

          Because the set after year2: 
            We started year2 with 2 worse employees (because year1: we only added two worse employees: 1 and 2) -> 
            Then in year2: we removed one of them (the worst, which is 1) -> then we added 400 (which is not worse) -> so we have 1 worse employee? 

          Therefore, the recurrence state = 2 is not matching the reality of 1? 

          What went wrong in the recurrence? 

          The recurrence: 
            H[1] = F1 = 4
            H[2] = H[1] - R1 + G1 = 4-4+2 = 2   [after the first scenario update for year1: G1=2]
            H[3] = H[2] - R2 + G2 = 2-1+0 = 1.

          Then condition for year3: H[3] - R3 = 1-2 = -1.

          So the formula is correct if we use the updated G1 and G2? 

          Therefore, we must recompute the entire D_arr for the initial state with the updated G_current as we process the queries? 
          But we cannot recompute the entire D_arr for each query? 

          The segment tree updates are suffix updates: 
            D0 = F1 - R1
            D1 = F1 - R1 + G1 - R2
            D2 = F1 - R1 + G1 - R2 + G2 - R3

          If we update G1 by delta, then:
            D0: unchanged.
            D1: becomes D1 + delta.
            D2: becomes D2 + delta.

          If we update G2 by delta, then:
            D0: unchanged.
            D1: unchanged.
            D2: becomes D2 + delta.

          In general: updating G_i by delta affects D for years i+1 to m: 
            Specifically, it affects D_i, D_{i+1}, ... up to D_{m-1}? 
            Because for any year j>=i+1, the term G_i appears in the sum.

          Therefore, the segment tree update: 
            for an update in year X, we add delta to the D_arr for indices from X to m-1.

          And this is what we did.

          But then for the second scenario: 
            year2: X=2, so we update indices [2, m-1] = [2,2] (if m=3) by -1? 
            Then the new D_arr = [0, 2, 1-1=0]? 

          But wait, what is the initial value of D2? 
            Initially: 
                D0 = 4-4=0
                D1 = 0 + 4 - 1 = 3   [because initially G1=4]
                D2 = 3 + 1 - 2 = 2   [because initially G2=1]

          Then after the first scenario: 
                update year1: add -1 to [1,2] -> 
                    D1 = 3-1 = 2
                    D2 = 2-1 = 1
          Then after the second scenario: 
                update year2: add -1 to [2,2] ->
                    D2 = 1-1 = 0

          Then we check: min = 0? -> which is nonnegative -> output 1? 

          But the sample output for the second scenario is 0? 

          Why? 

          The condition for year3: we require the state for year3: 
            state = H[3] = F1 - R1 + G1 - R2 + G2 = 4-4+2-1+0 = 1.
            Then we remove R3=2? -> we require 1>=2 -> fails.

          Therefore, the condition for year3 is not 0? it is 1-2 = -1? 

          How is D2 defined in the editorial? 
            D_t = H[t] - R_t.

          For year3: H[3] = 1, R3=2, so D2 = 1-2 = -1.

          But in our segment tree, we stored for year3: 
            initial: 2 (with the initial G values)
            then we subtracted 1 for the first scenario? -> 1
            then we subtracted 1 for the second scenario? -> 0

          Why did we not have -1? 

          Because the recurrence we used in the initial computation was:

            year1: D0 = S - R1, then S = S - R1 + G1.
            year2: D1 = S - R2, then S = S - R2 + G2.
            year3: D2 = S - R3.

          But after the updates, we have:
            year1: S = 4 - 4 + 2 = 2.
            year2: D1 = 2 - 1 = 1? -> then update: S = 2 - 1 + 0 = 1.
            year3: D2 = 1 - 2 = -1.

          Therefore, the value for year3 should be -1, not 0.

          How did we compute the update? 

          We said: 
            The formula for year3: 
                D2 = F1 - R1 - R2 - R3 + G1 + G2.
            = 4-4-1-2 + 2+0 = -3+2 = -1.

          But initially, with the given input: 
                year1: G1=4, year2: G2=1.
                D2 = 4-4-1-2 +4+1 = 2.
          Then we did two updates: 
                year1: G1: 4->2: subtract 2? 
                year2: G2: 1->0: subtract 1? 
                Then D2 = 2 -2 -1 = -1.

          Therefore, we should have updated year3 by -2 for the first scenario and then by -1 for the second scenario? 

          What is the dependency? 
            year1: if we update G1 by delta1, then we add delta1 to years>=1 (i.e., year2 and year3) -> 
                year2: index0: no, index0 is year1? year2 is index1, year3 is index2.
                Specifically: we add delta1 to year2 and year3.

            year2: update G2 by delta2, then we add delta2 to years>=2 (year3) -> index2.

          In the first scenario: 
            delta1 = -2 (because initially we counted 4, but then we change one employee from 3 (which is <50) to 300 (>=50) -> that is a change of -2? 
            because initially we counted 4? and after the update, we only have 2? so we need to subtract 2? 

          In the sample code, we did:

                old_contrib = (3<50) ? 1 : 0;
                new_contrib = (300<50) ? 0 : 0;   // wait, 300<50 is false -> 0.
                delta = 0 - 1 = -1.

          Why -1? 

          We only updated one employee? so the change in count is -1, not -2.

          The initial count for year1: we counted the entire array [1,2,3,100] -> 1,2,3 are <50 -> count=3? 
          Then we change one element from 3 to 300? -> then we remove one from the count? -> count becomes 2? 
          So the change is -1.

          Therefore, the recurrence: 
            year3: 
                initial: 4-4-1-2+3+1 = (4-4-1-2) is -3, then +3+1=1? -> 1.
                then after year1 update: subtract 1 from year2 and year3 -> year3 becomes 0.
                then after year2 update: subtract 1 from year3 -> year3 becomes -1.

          then we output 0.

          Therefore, the mistake was in the initial count for year1: the problem states that the new employees are [1,2,3,100] -> and then we change the third to 300, so the new array is [1,2,300,100] -> count=2.

          How to get the initial count for year1: 
            We counted the array as [1,2,3,100] -> count=3.
          Then the update should be: 
            old_val=3, new_val=300: 
              3<50 -> 1
              300<50 -> 0
              delta = -1.

          Then the new count is 3-1=2.

          So the initial computation of G1=3, not 4? 

          In the sample input: the year1: 
            "4 1 2 3 100"
          We read R1=4, then the next 4 integers: 1,2,3,100.

          Then we count: 
            1<50 -> true.
            2<50 -> true.
            3<50 -> true.
            100<50 -> false.
          count=3.

          Therefore, the state for year2: 4-4+3=3.

          Then the condition for year2: 3-1=2.

          year3: 3-1+1=3, then condition for year3: 3-2=1.

          Then the segment tree: 
            D_arr = [0,2,1]

          Then the first scenario: 
            Update: X=1, Y=3, Z=300.
            This changes the third employee in year1 from 3 to 300.
            old_contrib=1, new_contrib=0, delta=-1.
            Then update: 
               G1 = 3-1=2.
            Then update the segment tree: indices [1,2] (0-indexed) by -1.
            Then D_arr becomes [0, 2-1=1, 1-1=0].

            min=0 -> output 1.

          Then the second scenario: 
            Update: X=2, Y=1, Z=400.
            old_val=4: 4<50 -> true -> 1.
            new_val=400: false ->0.
            delta=-1.
            Then G2 = 1-1=0.
            Update the segment tree: indices [2,2] (0-indexed) by -1.
            Then D_arr[2] = 0-1 = -1.
            min = -1 -> output 0.

          This matches the sample output.

          Therefore, we must ensure that in the initial reading, we count the new employees correctly.

          Summary of changes:

            In the initial reading, for each year i, we read R_i and then R_i integers for B_arr[i] and count the number of values < A0.

            Then build the segment tree for D_arr of length m, computed by:
                S = F1
                for i=1..m:
                    D_arr[i-1] = S - R_arr[i]
                    S = S - R_arr[i] + G_current[i]

            For each query:
                X, Y, Z.
                old_val = B_arr[X][Y-1]
                new_val = Z
                old_contrib = (old_val < A0) ? 1 : 0
                new_contrib = (Z < A0) ? 1 : 0
                delta = new_contrib - old_contrib

                if (delta != 0):
                    G_current[X] += delta
                    if (X < m) {
                        seg_tree->update(X, m-1, delta);   // because the first affected year is year X+1, which is at index X in the D_arr (0-indexed) and goes to the last year (index m-1)
                    }
                    B_arr[X][Y-1] = Z;

                if (m==0) output 1
                else {
                    min_val = seg_tree->global_min()
                    if (min_val>=0) output 1
                    else output 0
                }

          Note: the segment tree global_min returns tree[1]? we must ensure that tree[1] is the min of the entire array? 
          In our segment tree, we maintain the tree so that the root (tree[1]) is the min? even after lazy updates? 
          But in our segment tree, we do range updates with lazy propagation? and then we update the root? 

          Therefore, tree[1] is the min of the entire array.

          However, we set the values beyond the first m to 1e18? so they are large and won't affect the min? 

          We'll code accordingly.

 23. Let's run the sample in code:

        n=5, m=3, q=3
        A = [50,40,30,20,10] -> A0=50, F1=4.

        Year1: R1=4, B1=[1,2,3,100] -> G1=3.
        Year2: R2=1, B2=[4] -> G2=1.
        Year3: R3=2, B3=[6,7] -> G3=2.

        Compute D_arr:
          year1: D0 = 4-4 = 0.
          then S = 4-4+3 = 3.
          year2: D1 = 3-1 = 2.
          then S = 3-1+1 = 3.
          year3: D2 = 3-2 = 1.
          D_arr = [0,2,1]

        Then queries:

          Query1: 1 3 300 -> X=1, Y=3, Z=300.
            old_val = 3 -> old_contrib=1.
            new_val=300 -> new_contrib=0.
            delta=-1.
            G1 = 3-1=2.
            update: X=1 < m=3 -> update indices [1,2] by -1: 
                D_arr becomes [0, 2-1=1, 1-1=0]
            global_min = min(0,1,0)=0 -> output 1.

          Query2: 2 1 400 -> X=2, Y=1, Z=400.
            old_val=4 -> old_contrib=1.
            new_val=400 -> new_contrib=0.
            delta=-1.
            G2 = 1-1=0.
            update: X=2 < m=3 -> update indices [2,2] by -1: 
                D_arr becomes [0,1,0-1=-1]
            global_min = -1 -> output 0.

          Query3: 2 1 5 -> X=2, Y=1, Z=5.
            old_val=400 -> we updated it in the second query, so it's 400? 
            new_val=5.
            old_contrib = (400<50) -> false:0.
            new_contrib = (5<50) -> true:1.
            delta=1.
            G2 = 0+1=1.
            update: X=2 < m=3 -> update indices [2,2] by 1: 
                D_arr becomes [0,1, -1+1=0]
            global_min = 0 -> output 1.

        But the sample output is:
            1
            0

        So the third query is not in the sample output? 

        The sample input has three queries, but the sample output has two? 
        Actually, the sample input:

          "5 3 3"
          then after the initial and the years, the queries are:
            1 3 300
            2 1 400
            2 1 5

          and the sample output is:
            1
            0

          But the sample output only has two integers? 

          Actually, the sample output is:

            1
            0

          So two lines.

          But the input has q=3, and three queries.

          The sample output provided in the problem is:

            1
            0

          So they only provided two outputs? 

          Or they only sample two outputs? 

          The problem sample output says:

            Sample Output #1
              1
              0

          and then they explain two scenarios.

          The third query: 
            "2 1 5" -> is the third scenario.

          And the output for the third scenario is not shown in the sample output.

          But the problem says "For each scenario in the same order as input", so we must output three answers.

          However, the sample output only has two? 

          Re-read the problem sample input:

            "5 3 3"
            "50 40 30 20 10"
            "4 1 2 3 100"
            "1 4"
            "2 6 7"
            "1 3 300"
            "2 1 400"
            "2 1 5"

          The sample output:

            1
            0

          So they output only two? 

          But wait, the problem sample input has 3 scenarios, but the sample output has 2 integers? 

          The sample input says: "Sample Input #1" and then the data, and then the sample output has two integers.

          Therefore, the sample output is for the first two scenarios? and the third is not shown? 

          Or the problem might have a typo? 

          But the sample explanation only explains two scenarios.

          Our code outputs:

            Query1: 1
            Query2: 0
            Query3: 1

          So we output:

            1
            0
            1

          But the sample output only has two lines? 

          The problem says: "For each scenario in the same order as input, output in a line ..."

          So we output three lines.

          The sample output provided in the problem statement has two lines? 

          This is a discrepancy.

          However, the constraints say Q scenarios, so we output Q lines.

          We'll output three lines for the sample.

          But the problem sample output is given as:

                1
                0

          So we must only output two for the sample? 

          Let me double-check the sample input:

            It says: "5 3 3" -> so Q=3.

          And then there are three queries.

          The sample output in the problem statement has two lines? 

          I see in the sample input/output:

            Input:
              5 3 3
              50 40 30 20 10
              4 1 2 3 100
              1 4
              2 6 7
              1 3 300
              2 1 400
              2 1 5

            Output:
              1
              0

          This is taken directly from the problem.

          Therefore, there is a possibility that the sample input has only two queries? 

          But it says Q=3, and then has three query lines.

          The problem might have a typo? 

          Or the sample output is only for the first two? 

          Given the problem sample explanation only explains two, we output two in the sample? 

          But the problem says: "output for each scenario", so Q lines.

          We will output Q lines.

          In any case, we have fixed the logic.

 24. Code accordingly.

 25. Note: The segment tree update_range function: we use 0-indexed for the array indices? 
        The segment tree covers indices 0 to m-1.

 26. Let me write the segment tree with lazy propagation carefully.

 27. Due to time, we will trust the sample.

 28. Edge: m=0 -> then we skip building the segment tree? and for every query output 1.

 29. Let's code accordingly.

 30. Important: We use 0-indexed for the years in the segment tree: 
        Year1 -> index0, year2->index1, year3->index2.

        And for an update in year X (1-indexed), we update the segment tree for indices [X, m-1] (0-indexed) -> 
            because X=1 -> indices [1, m-1] (year2 and beyond) -> 
            year2 is index1, which is the condition for year2? 
            But the condition for year2 is D1 = H[2]-R2, which is affected by G1.

          Specifically, we want to update the conditions for year X+1 to year m.

          Therefore, the first condition affected is the condition for year X+1, which is stored at index = X (0-indexed) if we consider:
            index0: year1
            index1: year2
            index2: year3

          So for year X=1, we update indices from 1 to m-1? -> which is year2 and year3.

          This matches.

 31. Code the segment tree carefully with lazy propagation.

 32. We'll use long long for the segment tree because the values might be large? 
        F1 <= 100000, R_i < N (<=100000) and the sum of R_i is at most 10^6? but the D_arr might be: 
          D_arr[i] = F1 - (R_1+...+R_{i+1}) + (G_1+...+G_i)

        The worst-case: F1=100000, and then we subtract up to 100000*100000? -> 10^10? so we need long long.

 33. Let's code.

 34. Note: The initial value for the segment tree for positions beyond the array (if size>m) is set to 1e18? 
        We use a large number (like 1e18) for the unused leaves.

 35. We assume the segment tree is 0-indexed.

 36. We'll run the sample to be sure.

 37. Due to the complexity, we hope it passes.

 38. Let me run the provided sample in the code.

        We'll skip the third query and output two lines for the sample if it matches.

        But the problem says Q=3, so three lines.

        However, the problem sample output only has two? 

        We'll output three for the sample input, but the expected sample output is two? 

        This is a problem.

        Re-read the problem: 
          "Sample Input #1
          5 3 3
          50 40 30 20 10
          4 1 2 3 100
          1 4
          2 6 7
          1 3 300
          2 1 400
          2 1 5

          Sample Output #1
          1
          0"

        And the explanation only explains two scenarios.

        Therefore, the sample input has three queries, but the sample output only has two answers? 

        This is likely a formatting mistake in the problem statement.

        But the sample input says Q=3, and has three queries.

        And the sample output has two integers? 

        We will output three integers: 
          1
          0
          1

        But the problem sample output is given as two integers? 

        This is a known issue? 

        I see the problem says: 
          "Sample Output #1
          1
          0"

        So we output two? 

        How to reconcile? 

        The problem might be that the third scenario is not part of the sample explanation? 

        But the sample input has three.

        We'll follow the specification: output Q answers.

 39. We'll submit and hope the online judge uses the sample with three outputs.

 40. Alternatively, the problem might have intended Q=2? 

        But the input says "5 3 3", and then has three query lines.

        We'll read three queries.

        And output three answers.

        The sample output provided in the problem is incomplete? 

        Given the constraints, we output three.

 41. Final code.
