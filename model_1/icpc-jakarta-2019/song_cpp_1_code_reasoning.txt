 We are going to follow the editorial guidelines exactly.
 Steps:
 1. Backward pass: compute the intervals [low_i, high_i] for each note i (from last to first).
    - For the last note: [L, R]
    - For note i (from n-2 down to 0):
        if A[i] < A[i+1]: 
            low_i = max(L, low_{i+1} - K)
            high_i = min(R, high_{i+1} - 1)
        if A[i] == A[i+1]:
            low_i = max(L, low_{i+1])
            high_i = min(R, high_{i+1])
        if A[i] > A[i+1]:
            low_i = max(L, low_{i+1} + 1)
            high_i = min(R, high_{i+1} + K)

    If at any step low_i > high_i, output -1 and return.

 2. Forward pass: assign the lexicographically smallest melody.
    - Start at the first note: assign B0 = low_0.
    - Then for i from 0 to n-2:
        if A[i] < A[i+1]:
            B[i+1] must be at least B[i] + 1 and also at least low[i+1]. But note: we also have an upper bound from the backward pass? However, we are constructing the lex smallest so we choose the smallest possible: max(B[i] + 1, low[i+1])
        if A[i] == A[i+1]:
            B[i+1] = B[i]   (and we must have low[i+1] <= B[i] <= high[i+1] -> but we know from backward that [low[i], high[i]] was computed so that when we set B[i] = low[i] then we have to check if B[i] is in the next interval? Actually the backward pass ensures that the intervals are compatible. However, note: if we set B[i] = low[i] and then for the equal case we set B[i+1]=B[i]=low[i], we must have that low[i] is in [low[i+1], high[i+1]]? Actually the backward pass for equal sets: 
                low_i = max(L, low[i+1])
                high_i = min(R, high[i+1])
            so then we have low[i] >= low[i+1] and low[i] <= high[i+1] (because low[i] is at least low[i+1] and at most high[i+1] since high_i is min(R, high[i+1]) and low[i] is at most high_i). So it's safe.

        if A[i] > A[i+1]:
            B[i+1] = max(low[i+1], B[i] - K)   [because we can drop as much as K, but we cannot go below low[i+1]]

 However, note: the constraint for decreasing requires B[i] > B[i+1]. So we need B[i+1] < B[i]. We set B[i+1] as the maximum between low[i+1] and B[i] - K. But note: we are allowed to drop by up to K, so the smallest we can set B[i+1] is B[i] - K, but we cannot go below low[i+1]. So we set to max(low[i+1], B[i] - K). However, we must also satisfy B[i+1] < B[i]. Therefore, we must have B[i] - K < B[i] always, but what if max(low[i+1], B[i]-K) is not less than B[i]? Then it would break. But note: the backward pass has ensured that the value we choose for B[i] is such that there exists a value for B[i+1] that is at most B[i]-1? Actually the backward pass for decreasing: we had low_i = max(L, low[i+1]+1) and high_i = min(R, high[i+1]+K). And we set B[i] to low[i] (the smallest possible). Then when we do B[i+1] = max(low[i+1], B[i]-K) = max(low[i+1], low[i]-K). Since low[i] = max(L, low[i+1]+1) => low[i] >= low[i+1]+1, so low[i]-K might be less than low[i+1] or not. But note: we are also constrained by the backward interval for i: low[i] <= high[i] and also we have the relationship that the value we choose for B[i] must be at least low[i] and at most high[i]. In the backward pass we have ensured that the interval for i is non-empty and that the constraints from the next note are satisfied.

 However, there is a catch: in the forward pass, we set the first note to low[0]. Then for the next note we set it to the smallest value allowed by the constraints. But note that we must also ensure that the value we set for the next note is within [low[i+1], high[i+1]]. Our assignment for the next note: 
   For increasing: max(low[i+1], B[i]+1) -> which is at least low[i+1] and at most? We don't set an explicit upper bound? But note: the backward pass for the next note has an upper bound (high[i+1]) and we are setting the smallest value so it's safe. However, we must check that the value we set does not exceed high[i+1]? Actually, the backward pass for i was computed from the next note's interval, so if we set the next note to the smallest value (which is at least low[i+1] and we know that the backward pass for i required that the next note must be at most high[i+1] and we are not exceeding that in the forward pass? Actually, we are not: we set the next note to the smallest value that satisfies the constraints, so it should be within [low[i+1], high[i+1]] because the backward pass has set the feasible interval.

 But wait: in the increasing case, we set B[i+1] = max(low[i+1], B[i]+1). However, the backward pass for note i requires that B[i] is at most high[i] = min(R, high[i+1]-1). So we have:
   B[i] <= high[i+1] - 1
   => B[i]+1 <= high[i+1]
   Therefore, the value we set for B[i+1] is at most high[i+1]? Actually, we set to max(low[i+1], B[i]+1) and we know that low[i+1] <= high[i+1] and B[i]+1 <= high[i+1] (from the backward constraint). So we are safe.

 Similarly, for the decreasing case: 
   We set B[i+1] = max(low[i+1], B[i]-K)
   We have from the backward pass for i: 
        low[i] = max(L, low[i+1]+1) -> so B[i] = low[i] >= low[i+1]+1 -> then B[i]-K might be less than low[i+1] or not. But if it is, then we set to low[i+1]. And we also know from the backward pass that we have:
        high[i] = min(R, high[i+1]+K) -> so B[i] <= high[i+1]+K -> then B[i]-K <= high[i+1]. Therefore, the value we set is at most high[i+1]? Actually, we set to max(low[i+1], B[i]-K) which is at least low[i+1] and at most? It could be that B[i]-K is very large, but note: we know from the backward pass that B[i] is at most high[i+1]+K, so B[i]-K <= high[i+1]. Therefore, the value we set is at most high[i+1]? Actually, if B[i]-K is greater than low[i+1] then we set to B[i]-K, which is at most high[i+1] (because B[i] <= high[i+1]+K -> B[i]-K <= high[i+1]). So it is within the interval.

 However, one more constraint: we require that in the decreasing case, B[i] > B[i+1]. 
   If we set B[i+1] = B[i]-K, then clearly B[i] > B[i+1] because K>=1. 
   If we set B[i+1] = low[i+1], then we require that low[i+1] < B[i]. 
        But from the backward pass: we have low[i] = max(L, low[i+1]+1) -> so B[i] (which is at least low[i]) is at least low[i+1]+1. Therefore, B[i] >= low[i+1]+1 > low[i+1]. So it's safe.

 Therefore, the forward pass is:

   res[0] = low[0]
   for i in 0 to n-2:
        if A[i] < A[i+1]:
            res[i+1] = max(low[i+1], res[i] + 1)
        else if A[i] == A[i+1]:
            res[i+1] = res[i]
        else: # decreasing
            res[i+1] = max(low[i+1], res[i] - K)

 But note: we must also ensure that the value we set for the next note does not exceed R? Actually, the backward pass already constrained the next note to be at most R (via min(R, ...) in the backward propagation). And our assignment is within [low[i+1], ...] and low[i+1] is at least L? and we know the backward pass sets the interval to be within [L, R]. So we are safe.

 However, one more point: the forward assignment must also not violate the adjacent difference constraint? 
   For increasing: |B[i+1]-B[i]| = B[i+1]-B[i] = max(low[i+1] - B[i], 1) ... but actually if low[i+1] > B[i]+1, then we set to low[i+1] and then the difference is low[i+1]-B[i] which might be more than K? 

 Let me check: 
   The backward pass for note i (in increasing case) had:
        low_i = max(L, low[i+1]-K)   => so low[i] >= low[i+1]-K => then since B[i] = low[i] (at the start of the forward pass? actually we set the first to low[0] and then we set the next to max(low[i+1], B[i]+1). But note: the backward pass for i also requires that the next note must be at most high[i] = min(R, high[i+1]-1) ... but that doesn't directly give the step constraint.

 Actually, the constraint we have is that |B[i] - B[i+1]| <= K. In the increasing case, we require B[i] < B[i+1] and |diff|<=K so we require B[i+1] <= B[i]+K. But in our assignment we set B[i+1] = max(low[i+1], B[i]+1). We don't explicitly check if B[i+1] <= B[i]+K? 

 However, note: the backward pass for note i in the increasing case had:
        low_i = max(L, low[i+1]-K)   => then B[i] >= low[i] >= low[i+1]-K  => low[i+1] <= B[i] + K.
        Therefore, if we set B[i+1] = low[i+1] (if low[i+1] >= B[i]+1) then we have B[i+1] <= B[i]+K? 
        Actually: we have low[i+1] <= B[i] + K (from above). So then if we set to low[i+1], then we have B[i+1] <= B[i]+K. And if we set to B[i]+1, then the difference is 1 which is <=K.

 Therefore, the adjacent constraint is satisfied.

 Similarly, for decreasing: we set to max(low[i+1], B[i]-K). Then:
        If we set to low[i+1]: then B[i] - B[i+1] = B[i] - low[i+1] <= K? 
            From the backward pass: for decreasing, we had low_i = max(L, low[i+1]+1) -> so B[i] >= low[i+1]+1 -> then B[i] - low[i+1] >= 1. But we also had: high_i = min(R, high[i+1]+K) -> then B[i] <= high[i+1]+K -> but that doesn't directly give an upper bound on the difference? However, note: the backward pass for note i in decreasing also had the constraint that the next note must be at least B[i]-K? Actually, we don't have that explicitly. But let me derive:

        We have from the backward pass for note i (decreasing): 
            low_i = max(L, low[i+1]+1)   => so B[i] >= low[i+1]+1 -> then B[i] - low[i+1] >= 1.
            But we also have: the backward pass for note i+1: [low[i+1], high[i+1]] is a subset of [L,R]. And we know that the constraint for the step is |B[i]-B[i+1]|<=K. If we set B[i+1] to low[i+1], then we require |B[i]-low[i+1]|<=K -> that is B[i] - low[i+1] <= K? 
            How do we know that? From the backward pass we also had: 
                high_i = min(R, high[i+1]+K) -> but that does not give the lower bound for the difference? 

        Actually, we have the constraint that the value we choose for B[i] must be such that there exists a value for B[i+1] that is in [low[i+1], high[i+1]] and also |B[i]-B[i+1]|<=K. The backward propagation for decreasing uses the condition: 
            B[i] must be at least low[i+1]+1 and at most high[i+1]+K. 
            Then if we choose B[i] = some value, then the next note must be at least B[i]-K (because |B[i]-B[i+1]|<=K and we are decreasing) and at least low[i+1]. 

        But note: the backward propagation did not use the step constraint for the next note? Actually, the backward propagation is built to ensure that from note i we can jump to a note at i+1 that is in [low[i+1], high[i+1]] and also the step constraint is satisfied? 

        Specifically, for the decreasing case, the backward propagation for note i was:
            low_i = max(L, low[i+1]+1)   -> because we must have B[i] > B[i+1] and the step constraint: we can have B[i] as low as low[i+1]+1 (if we set B[i+1] to low[i+1], then we require B[i] <= low[i+1]+K? to satisfy the step? Actually, the step constraint: |B[i]-B[i+1]|<=K -> then if B[i] is set to low[i+1]+1, then the step is 1 which is <=K. But what if we set B[i] to a larger value? Then we must set B[i+1] to at least B[i]-K. And the backward propagation for the upper bound of note i: high_i = min(R, high[i+1]+K). This is because the next note can be as large as high[i+1], then the current note can be as large as high[i+1]+K (so that the step from the current to the next is K) and still satisfy the decreasing condition (B[i] > B[i+1]). 

        Therefore, if we set B[i] to x, then the next note must be in [max(low[i+1], x-K), min(high[i+1], x-1)]? But the backward propagation does not store the step constraint explicitly? Actually, the backward propagation for note i in decreasing case ensures that x must be at least low[i+1]+1 and at most high[i+1]+K. Then the step constraint is automatically satisfied? Because if we choose the next note y = max(low[i+1], x-K) (which is at least x-K) and then |x-y| = x - y <= x - (x-K) = K? Actually, if we set y = x-K, then the difference is K. If we set y to low[i+1] and low[i+1] >= x-K, then the difference is x - low[i+1] which is <= x - (x-K) = K? No: if low[i+1] > x-K, then we set y = low[i+1] and the difference is x - low[i+1] < K? Actually, we have low[i+1] > x-K -> so x - low[i+1] < K. Therefore, the step constraint is satisfied.

        But note: the condition for the step is |x-y|<=K. Since y = max(low[i+1], x-K) and then:
          if y = x-K: then |x-y| = K <= K -> ok.
          if y = low[i+1] and low[i+1] >= x-K: then |x-y| = x - low[i+1] <= K? 
              We have low[i+1] >= x-K -> then x - low[i+1] <= K -> so |x-y| = x-y <= K.

        Therefore, the step constraint is satisfied.

 Implementation:

   Steps:
    1. Read n, L, R, K and the array A of n integers.
    2. Initialize two arrays (or vectors) low and high of length n.
    3. Set the last element: 
          low[n-1] = L, high[n-1] = R.
    4. Traverse backwards from n-2 to 0:
          if A[i] < A[i+1]:
              low[i] = max(L, low[i+1] - K)
              high[i] = min(R, high[i+1] - 1)
          else if A[i] == A[i+1]:
              low[i] = max(L, low[i+1])
              high[i] = min(R, high[i+1])
          else: # A[i] > A[i+1]
              low[i] = max(L, low[i+1] + 1)
              high[i] = min(R, high[i+1] + K)

          If at any step low[i] > high[i], output -1 and return.

    5. Now, traverse forward to assign the lexicographically smallest melody.
          res[0] = low[0]
          for i from 0 to n-2:
             if A[i] < A[i+1]:
                 res[i+1] = max(low[i+1], res[i] + 1)
             else if A[i] == A[i+1]:
                 res[i+1] = res[i]
             else: 
                 res[i+1] = max(low[i+1], res[i] - K)

    6. Output the array res.

 But note: we must also ensure that the forward pass does not violate the vocal range? 
        The backward pass has ensured that the interval [low[i], high[i]] is within [L,R], and we set each note to at least low[i] (and the forward assignment might set it to a value that is within [low[i], high[i]]). Therefore, the note is in [L,R]. 

 However, what about the step constraint? We argued above that it is satisfied.

 Let me test with the sample: 
   Input: 16 1 8 6
   A = [1,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,3,7,8,9,10,11,12,12]

   We know the expected output.

   Backward pass for the last note (index 15): low[15]=1, high[15]=8.
   Then for index 14: A[14]=12, A[15]=12 -> equal -> 
        low[14] = max(1, low[15]) = 1
        high[14] = min(8, high[15]) = 8.

   Then index 13: A[13]=11, A[14]=12 -> decreasing (because 11<12? actually no: 11<12 -> so increasing? 
        Actually: A[13] = 11, A[14]=12 -> A[13] < A[14] -> then we are going from 13 to 14: increasing? 
        But the problem says: for i from 0 to n-2: condition on (i, i+1). 
        So for index 13 (the 14th note?) and index 14 (the 15th note): A[13] < A[14] -> so increasing.

        Then: low[13] = max(1, low[14]-6) = max(1,1-6)=1
               high[13] = min(8, high[14]-1) = min(8,8-1)=7.

   Then index 12: A[12]=10, A[13]=11 -> increasing: 
        low[12] = max(1, low[13]-6)=max(1,1-6)=1
        high[12] = min(8, high[13]-1)=min(8,7-1)=6.

   Then index 11: A[11]=9, A[12]=10 -> increasing: 
        low[11] = max(1,1-6)=1, high[11]=min(8,6-1)=5.

   Then index 10: A[10]=8, A[11]=9 -> increasing: 
        low[10]=max(1,1-6)=1, high[10]=min(8,5-1)=4.

   Then index 9: A[9]=7, A[10]=8 -> increasing: 
        low[9]=1, high[9]=3.

   Then index 8: A[8]=3, A[9]=7 -> increasing: 
        low[8]=max(1,1-6)=1, high[8]=min(8,3-1)=2.

   Then index 7: A[7]=10, A[8]=3 -> decreasing (10>3): 
        low[7]=max(1, low[8]+1)=max(1,1+1)=2
        high[7]=min(8, high[8]+6)=min(8,2+6)=8.

   Then index 6: A[6]=9, A[7]=10 -> increasing: 
        low[6]=max(1, low[7]-6)=max(1,2-6)=1
        high[6]=min(8, high[7]-1)=min(8,8-1)=7.

   Then index 5: A[5]=8, A[6]=9 -> increasing: 
        low[5]=max(1,1-6)=1, high[5]=min(8,7-1)=6.

   Then index 4: A[4]=7, A[5]=8 -> increasing: 
        low[4]=1, high[4]=5.

   Then index 3: A[3]=6, A[4]=7 -> increasing: 
        low[3]=1, high[3]=4.

   Then index 2: A[2]=5, A[3]=6 -> increasing: 
        low[2]=1, high[2]=3.

   Then index 1: A[1]=3, A[2]=5 -> increasing: 
        low[1]=max(1,1-6)=1, high[1]=min(8,3-1)=2.

   Then index 0: A[0]=1, A[1]=3 -> increasing: 
        low[0]=max(1,1-6)=1, high[0]=min(8,2-1)=1.

   So then the forward pass:
        res[0] = low[0] = 1.
        A[0]<A[1]: res[1] = max(low[1], 1+1)=max(1,2)=2.
        A[1]<A[2]: res[2]=max(low[2],2+1)=max(1,3)=3.
        A[2]<A[3]: res[3]=max(1,3+1)=4.
        ... until index 7: 
            res[7] = ... = 8? 
            Then at index 8: A[7]=10, A[8]=3 -> decreasing -> res[8]=max(low[8], res[7]-K)=max(1, 8-6)=max(1,2)=2.
        Then increasing again: 
            res[9]=max(low[9], res[8]+1)=max(1,2+1)=3? 
            But the sample output is 3? Actually the sample output for index9 is 3? 
            The sample output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,8]

        So we get:
            index0:1, index1:2, index2:3, index3:4, index4:5, index5:6, index6:7, index7:8, 
            index8:2, 
            index9: max(1, 2+1)=3 -> correct.
            index10: max(1,3+1)=4 -> correct.
            index11:5, index12:6, index13:7, index14: max(low[14]=1, 7+1)=8? 
            But sample has 8 at index14? and then index15: equal -> 8.

        However, note: our backward pass for index14 was [1,8] and we set to 8? 
        But the sample output for index14 is 8? and then index15:8.

        But wait: at index13 we had 7, then index14: increasing? so we set to max(low[14], 7+1)=max(1,8)=8 -> then index15: equal -> set to 8.

        So the entire output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,8] -> matches.

   Now sample input 2: 
        16 1 8 6
        A = [1,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,3,7,8,9,10,11,12,13]   -> the last note is 13, but the vocal range is [1,8] -> the last note must be between 1 and 8? but 13 is not in that range? Actually the last note in the new melody must be in [1,8]. The original A is only for the relative constraints, but the new melody B must be in [1,8]. So the last note must be between 1 and 8.

        In the backward pass: 
          The last note: low[15]=1, high[15]=8 -> so the last note must be in [1,8]. Then for index14: 
          A[14]=12, A[15]=13 -> increasing -> 
             low[14] = max(1, low[15]-6)=max(1,1-6)=1
             high[14] = min(8, high[15]-1)=min(8,8-1)=7.
          Then index13: increasing: 
             low[13]=max(1,1-6)=1, high[13]=min(8,7-1)=6.
          Then index12: increasing: 
             low[12]=1, high[12]=5.
          Then index11: increasing: 
             low[11]=1, high[11]=4.
          Then index10: increasing: 
             low[10]=1, high[10]=3.
          Then index9: increasing: 
             low[9]=1, high[9]=2.
          Then index8: A[8]=3, A[9]=7 -> increasing: 
             low[8]=max(1, low[9]-6)=max(1,1-6)=1, high[8]=min(8, high[9]-1)=min(8,2-1)=1.
          Then index7: A[7]=10, A[8]=3 -> decreasing: 
             low[7]=max(1, low[8]+1)=max(1,1+1)=2
             high[7]=min(8, high[8]+6)=min(8,1+6)=7.
          Then index6: increasing: 
             low[6]=max(1,2-6)=1, high[6]=min(8,7-1)=6.
          Then index5: increasing: 
             low[5]=1, high[5]=5.
          Then index4: increasing: 
             low[4]=1, high[4]=4.
          Then index3: increasing: 
             low[3]=1, high[3]=3.
          Then index2: increasing: 
             low[2]=1, high[2]=2.
          Then index1: increasing: 
             low[1]=1, high[1]=1.
          Then index0: increasing: 
             low[0]=max(1, low[1]-6)=max(1,1-6)=1, high[0]=min(8,1-1)=min(8,0) -> 0? -> then low[0]=1, high[0]=0 -> 1>0 -> impossible -> output -1.

        So we output -1 -> matches sample.

   Sample input 3: 
        16 1 10 10
        A = [1,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,3,7,8,9,1,11,12,13]

        We'll compute the backward pass for the last note: 
          low[15]=1, high[15]=10.
        Then index14: A[14]=12, A[15]=13 -> increasing: 
          low[14]=max(1,1-10)=1, high[14]=min(10,10-1)=9.
        Then index13: A[13]=11, A[14]=12 -> increasing: 
          low[13]=1, high[13]=8.
        Then index12: A[12]=1, A[13]=11 -> increasing: 
          low[12]=max(1,1-10)=1, high[12]=min(10,8-1)=7.
        Then index11: A[11]=9, A[12]=1 -> decreasing: 
          low[11]=max(1, low[12]+1)=max(1,1+1)=2
          high[11]=min(10, high[12]+10)=min(10,7+10)=10.
        Then index10: A[10]=8, A[11]=9 -> increasing: 
          low[10]=max(1,2-10)=1, high[10]=min(10,10-1)=9.
        Then index9: A[9]=7, A[10]=8 -> increasing: 
          low[9]=1, high[9]=8.
        Then index8: A[8]=3, A[9]=7 -> increasing: 
          low[8]=1, high[8]=7.
        Then index7: A[7]=10, A[8]=3 -> decreasing: 
          low[7]=max(1,1+1)=2, high[7]=min(10,7+10)=10.
        Then index6: A[6]=9, A[7]=10 -> increasing: 
          low[6]=max(1,2-10)=1, high[6]=min(10,10-1)=9.
        Then index5: A[5]=8, A[6]=9 -> increasing: 
          low[5]=1, high[5]=8.
        Then index4: A[4]=7, A[5]=8 -> increasing: 
          low[4]=1, high[4]=7.
        Then index3: A[3]=6, A[4]=7 -> increasing: 
          low[3]=1, high[3]=6.
        Then index2: A[2]=5, A[3]=6 -> increasing: 
          low[2]=1, high[2]=5.
        Then index1: A[1]=3, A[2]=5 -> increasing: 
          low[1]=1, high[1]=4.
        Then index0: A[0]=1, A[1]=3 -> increasing: 
          low[0]=1, high[0]=min(10,4-1)=3.

        Forward pass:
          res[0]=1.
          res[1]=max(low[1],1+1)=max(1,2)=2.
          res[2]=max(1,2+1)=3.
          res[3]=4.
          res[4]=5.
          res[5]=6.
          res[6]=7.
          res[7]=8? -> but wait: 
             A[7]=10, A[8]=3 -> decreasing -> so res[8]=max(low[8]=1, 8-10)=max(1, -2)=1? 
             But the sample output for index8 is 1? and then the sample output: ... 8,1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4 -> so we have:
                res[7]=8? but then res[8] = max(1,8-10)=1 -> then the sample output for index8 is 1? 
                Then index9: increasing -> res[9]=max(1,1+1)=2.
                index10: increasing: 2+1=3.
                index11: increasing: 4.
                index12: A[11]=9, A[12]=1 -> decreasing: res[12]=max(low[12]=1, 4-10)=max(1,-6)=1 -> then sample has 1 at index12? 
                Then index13: increasing: max(1,1+1)=2.
                index14: increasing: 3.
                index15: increasing: 4? -> but sample output: 4.

        However, the sample output is: 
            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4

        So we have:
          index0:1, index1:2, index2:3, index3:4, index4:5, index5:6, index6:7, index7:8, 
          index8:1, 
          index9:2, index10:3, index11:4, 
          index12:1, 
          index13:2, index14:3, index15:4.

        But note: the original A for index7 and index8: A[7]=10 and A[8]=3 -> 10>3 -> so we set res[8]=max(low[8]=1, res[7]-10)=max(1,8-10)=1 -> correct.

        Then for index8 to index9: A[8]=3, A[9]=7 -> increasing? so we set res[9]=max(low[9]=1, 1+1)=2 -> correct.

        Then index11 to index12: A[11]=9, A[12]=1 -> decreasing? then res[12]=max(low[12]=1, res[11]-10)=max(1,4-10)=1 -> correct.

        Then index12 to index13: A[12]=1, A[13]=11 -> increasing: res[13]=max(low[13]=1, 1+1)=2 -> correct.

        Then index13 to index14: increasing: 3, then 4.

        So our output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4] -> matches.

 Therefore, we code accordingly.

 Time complexity: O(n) for two passes.

 Note: The constraints: n up to 100000, and integers up to 10^9 -> we are using integer arithmetic so it's efficient.

 Let me code accordingly.

 Important: In the backward pass, we start from the last element and go to the first.

 Implementation in C++:

   #include <iostream>
   #include <vector>
   #include <climits>
   #include <cctype>
   #include <algorithm>
   using namespace std;

   int main() {
        int n;
        long long L, R, K;
        cin >> n >> L >> R >> K;
        vector<long long> A(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cin >> A[i];
        }

        vector<long long> low(n);
        vector<long long> high(n);

        // Step 1: Backward propagation
        low[n-1] = L;
        high[n-1] = R;

        for (int i = n-2; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (A[i] < A[i+1]) {
                // Increasing: B[i] < B[i+1] and |B[i]-B[i+1]|<=K -> so B[i] in [B[i+1]-K, B[i+1]-1] 
                // But we are using the computed intervals for the next note: [low[i+1], high[i+1]]
                // Then for the current note: 
                //   low[i] = max(L, low[i+1] - K);
                //   high[i] = min(R, high[i+1] - 1);
                low[i] = max(L, low[i+1] - K);
                high[i] = min(R, high[i+1] - 1);
            } else if (A[i] == A[i+1]) {
                low[i] = max(L, low[i+1]);
                high[i] = min(R, high[i+1]);
            } else { // A[i] > A[i+1]
                low[i] = max(L, low[i+1] + 1);
                high[i] = min(R, high[i+1] + K);
            }

            // Check if the interval is valid
            if (low[i] > high[i]) {
                cout << -1 << endl;
                return 0;
            }
        }

        // Step 2: Forward assignment
        vector<long long> res(n);
        res[0] = low[0];

        for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
            if (A[i] < A[i+1]) {
                // We require B[i+1] >= B[i] + 1 and also at least low[i+1]
                res[i+1] = max(low[i+1], res[i] + 1);
            } else if (A[i] == A[i+1]) {
                res[i+1] = res[i];
            } else {
                res[i+1] = max(low[i+1], res[i] - K);
            }
        }

        // Output the result
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i > 0) cout << " ";
            cout << res[i];
        }
        cout << endl;

        return 0;
   }

 However, note: we have not checked the forward pass against the backward interval? 
        Actually, the forward pass sets res[i] to a value that is at least low[i] (by the backward interval) and at most? ... but the forward pass does not check the upper bound? 

        Why? Because we are constructing the lexicographically smallest, and we set to the smallest possible value. However, we must ensure that the value we set is not greater than high[i]? 

        But note: the backward pass for the next note and the constraints for the step might force that the value we set is within the interval? 

        Actually, in the forward pass we set:
          For increasing: res[i+1] = max(low[i+1], res[i]+1) -> and we know from the backward pass that the next note must be at least low[i+1] and at most high[i+1]. But we are not checking high[i+1]. 

        How do we know that res[i+1] <= high[i+1]? 

        Consider the increasing case: 
            We have from the backward pass for note i: 
                high[i] = min(R, high[i+1]-1) -> then res[i] <= high[i] <= high[i+1]-1 -> then res[i]+1 <= high[i+1]. 
            And also, we set res[i+1] = max(low[i+1], res[i]+1) -> and low[i+1] <= high[i+1] (by the backward pass interval). So res[i+1] <= high[i+1]? 
                Actually: res[i+1] = res[i]+1 (if res[i]+1 >= low[i+1]) -> then we have res[i+1] <= high[i+1] because res[i]+1 <= high[i+1] (as argued above). 
                Or if we set to low[i+1] then we have low[i+1] <= high[i+1].

        Similarly, for equal: 
            We set res[i+1] = res[i]. 
            From the backward pass for note i: 
                low[i] = max(L, low[i+1]), high[i] = min(R, high[i+1])
            and we set res[i] = low[i] (at the start of the forward pass? actually not: we set the first to low[0] and then propagate). But note: the backward pass for equal: 
                The next note must be in [low[i+1], high[i+1]] and the current note must be the same. And we set the current note to a value that is at least low[i] and at most high[i]. 
            But the backward pass for note i: 
                low[i] = max(L, low[i+1]) -> so res[i] >= low[i] >= low[i+1]
                high[i] = min(R, high[i+1]) -> so res[i] <= high[i] <= high[i+1]
            Then res[i+1] = res[i] is in [low[i+1], high[i+1]]? 
                Because res[i] is at least low[i] which is at least low[i+1] and at most high[i] which is at most high[i+1]. 

        For decreasing: 
            We set res[i+1] = max(low[i+1], res[i]-K)
            We know from the backward pass for note i: 
                high[i] = min(R, high[i+1]+K) -> then res[i] <= high[i] <= high[i+1]+K -> then res[i]-K <= high[i+1]. 
            And we set to max(low[i+1], res[i]-K) -> so we have:
                If we set to low[i+1]: then it's at most high[i+1] (by backward pass interval).
                If we set to res[i]-K: then it's at most high[i+1] (because res[i]-K <= high[i+1] as above).

        Therefore, the value we set for the next note is within [low[i+1], high[i+1]]? 

        However, what about the current note? 
          In the forward pass, we set the first note to low[0] which is in [low[0], high[0]]. Then for the next note, we set it to a value that is within [low[1], high[1]]. Then by induction, all notes are within their backward intervals and hence in [L,R].

        But note: the backward pass for note i ensures that the value we choose for the current note must be in [low[i], high[i]]. And the forward pass sets the current note to a value that is at least low[i] (by the assignment: we set the first to low[0], and then the next is at least low[i+1] which is the lower bound for that note). However, we must also ensure that the current note does not exceed high[i]? 

        How do we know that the current note (res[i]) is at most high[i]? 
          For the first note: res[0]=low[0] and low[0]<=high[0] (by the backward pass). 
          For the next note: 
            In increasing: we set res[i+1]=max(low[i+1], res[i]+1). We know that the backward pass for note i: 
                high[i] = min(R, high[i+1]-1) -> then res[i] <= high[i] <= high[i+1]-1 -> then res[i]+1 <= high[i+1] -> and we set res[i+1] to res[i]+1 which is <= high[i+1] (so within the interval). 
            But what if we set to low[i+1]? then we know low[i+1] <= high[i+1] so it's safe.

          However, we did not check that the current note itself (res[i]) is at most high[i]? 
                Actually, we set the current note in the forward pass to a value that was set in a previous step and we know that the previous step set it to a value that was at least low[i-1] and at most high[i-1]? 

          But note: the backward pass for note i-1 constrains the current note (as the next note for i-1) and then we set the current note to a value that is within [low[i], high[i]]? 

          Actually, the forward pass does not check the upper bound for the current note? 

          How about we do:

            In the forward pass, after setting the current note, we check if it is within [low[i], high[i]]? 

          However, the backward pass for the current note i was computed from the next note, and then the forward pass sets the current note to a value that is at least low[i] (by the way we set the next note: we set the next note to at least low[i+1] and then the current note might be set from the previous note). 

          But the backward pass does not guarantee that the value we set in the forward pass for the current note is at most high[i]? 

          Let me check:

            Consider the increasing case for the current note (as the next note for the previous note): 
                We set res[i] = max(low[i], res[i-1]+1). 
                We know from the backward pass for the previous note (i-1): 
                    high[i-1] = min(R, high[i]-1) -> then res[i-1] <= high[i-1] <= high[i]-1 -> then res[i-1]+1 <= high[i]. 
                And also, we set res[i] to at most max(low[i], res[i-1]+1) -> which is at most high[i]? 
                    Because if we set to res[i-1]+1, then it is at most high[i] (as above). 
                    If we set to low[i], then we know low[i] <= high[i] (by backward pass).

          Similarly, for equal: 
                We set res[i] = res[i-1]. 
                From the backward pass for note i-1: 
                    low[i-1] = max(L, low[i]) and high[i-1] = min(R, high[i]). 
                And we set res[i-1] to a value in [low[i-1], high[i-1]] -> then res[i-1] is at least low[i] and at most high[i]. 

          For decreasing: 
                We set res[i] = max(low[i], res[i-1]-K). 
                From the backward pass for note i-1: 
                    high[i-1] = min(R, high[i]+K) -> then res[i-1] <= high[i-1] <= high[i]+K -> then res[i-1]-K <= high[i]. 
                Then the value we set is at most high[i]? 
                    If we set to res[i-1]-K: then it is at most high[i]. 
                    If we set to low[i]: then it is at most high[i]. 

          Therefore, the current note is always within [low[i], high[i]]? 

          But note: we set the current note in the forward pass without explicitly checking the upper bound? 

          Actually, the backward pass for the previous note and the constraints of the step and the interval for the current note guarantee that the value we set is at most high[i]. 

        So we don't need an explicit check? 

        However, let me test a potential problem:

          Suppose for note i: 
             low[i]=3, high[i]=5.
          Then we set the current note to 3 (if it's the first note) or by propagation.

          Then the next note: 
             Suppose it is increasing and the next note has low[i+1]=10 and high[i+1]=20. 
          Then we set the next note to max(10, 3+1)=10. 
          But the backward pass for note i: 
                high[i] = min(R, high[i+1]-1) = min(R,19) -> which we set to 5? 
          Then when we set the next note to 10, we are relying on the fact that the backward pass for note i had set high[i] to 5? 

          Then the next note being 10 is not in the interval for note i? Actually, note i is already set to 3 which is in [3,5]. The next note is set to 10 which is in the interval for note i+1] [10,20]? 

          But the backward pass for note i: 
                We computed: 
                  high[i] = min(R, high[i+1]-1) = min(R,19) -> if R>=19 then 19, else R. 
                But if we set R=5, then high[i] = min(5,19)=5. 
                Then the current note is set to 3 (which is <=5) -> then the next note: 
                    res[i+1] = max(10, 3+1)=10. 
                But is 10 in the interval for note i+1]? 
                    We computed low[i+1]=10, high[i+1]=20 -> so 10 is in [10,20] -> valid.

          However, we did not check that the step constraint for note i to note i+1] is satisfied? 
                |3-10|=7 -> if K=6 then it fails? 

          But the backward pass for note i (in the increasing case) had: 
                low[i] = max(L, low[i+1]-K) = max(?, 10-6)=4 -> then we set low[i]=max(L,4). 
                Then the interval for note i: [max(L,4), min(5,19)] -> if L=1 then [4,5]. 
                Then the forward pass sets the current note to 4 (if L=1) or 5? 
                Then the next note: max(10, 4+1)=10 -> step is 6? -> 10-4=6 which is <=K=6 -> valid.

          How did we get low[i]=4? 
                Because we did: low[i] = max(L, low[i+1]-K) = max(1,10-6)=4.

          Then the forward pass sets the current note to the smallest possible: 4 -> then the next note: 10 -> step=6<=K -> valid.

          Therefore, the backward pass ensures that the step constraint is satisfied? 

        So the algorithm is correct.

        We will code accordingly.

        One more note: use long long because L,R,K,A[i] up to 10^9 and n up to 100000, and the values in the backward pass might be as large as R + K (which can be up to 2e9, so int might be too small).

        Let me use long long for everything.

        Code accordingly.

        However, note: the problem says "Output -1 if there is no melody", and we output the melody otherwise.

        We'll write the code as above.

        Let me test with a small sample that fails without long long? 
            Suppose: L=1, R=2000000000, K=2000000000, and n=100000, then the backward propagation for the last note: 
                low[n-1]=1, high[n-1]=2000000000.
            Then if we have an increasing sequence, then the first note: 
                low[0] = 1 - (n-1)*K -> which might be negative? 
                But we do: low[i] = max(L, ...) so it would be clamped to L=1.

            But the backward propagation for the first note might require: 
                low[0] = max(1, ...) -> then it's at least 1.

            So the numbers are bounded by L and R? which are 1 and 2000000000 -> so long long is safe.

        Code:

        Note: The problem constraints: 
          N: 1 to 100000
          L, R, K: 1 to 10^9
          A[i]: 1 to 10^9

        We use long long for all numbers.

        Let me run the sample inputs.

        Sample Input 1: 
            16 1 8 6
            1 3 5 6 7 8 9 10 3 7 8 9 10 11 12 12

        We'll output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 8

        Sample Input 2: 
            16 1 8 6
            1 3 5 6 7 8 9 10 3 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 -> output -1

        Sample Input 3: 
            16 1 10 10
            1 3 5 6 7 8 9 10 3 7 8 9 1 11 12 13 -> output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4

        We'll code accordingly.

        Edge: n=1
          Backward: low[0]=L, high[0]=R.
          Then forward: res[0]=low[0] = L -> then output L.

          But what if L is not in [L,R]? it is. 

        So we output L.

        But if L is not in [L,R]? -> it is always in.

        Therefore, we are safe.

        Let me run n=1: 
            Input: "1 5 10 100"
                   7
            Then backward: low[0]=5, high[0]=10.
            Then res[0]=5 -> output 5.

        But the sample input: A = [7] -> then the constraints: 
          There are no consecutive pairs -> so the constraints are only that the note is in [5,10]. 
          Lex smallest: 5.

        Correct.

        Another edge: n=2, increasing: 
            Input: "2 1 10 1"
                  1 2
            Then backward: 
                note1: [1,10]
                note0: increasing: 
                    low0 = max(1, low1-1)=max(1,1-1)=max(1,0)=1
                    high0 = min(10, high1-1)=min(10,10-1)=9
                Then forward: 
                    res0 = 1
                    res1 = max(low1=1, 1+1)=max(1,2)=2 -> output "1 2"

        If K=0: 
            Then for increasing: 
                backward: 
                    note1: [1,10]
                    note0: low0 = max(1, low1-0) = max(1,1)=1
                           high0 = min(10, high1-1)=9
                Then forward: 
                    res0=1
                    res1 = max(1,1+1)=2 -> but the step constraint: |1-2|=1 must be <=0? -> fails.

        But the constraints: K>=1 (as per input: 1<=K).

        So we are safe.

        We code accordingly.

        Note: We must use long long to avoid overflow.

        Let me write the C++ code accordingly.
