We are given a tree with N nodes (3 <= N <= 4000) and N-1 edges. We need to find a node u (with degree at least 2) such that when we remove u, we get k (>=2) disconnected trees that are all pairwise identical. Moreover, we wish to output the maximum such k (i.e. the maximum number of identical trees we can get by removing one good cutting point). If no such node exists, output -1.

Key observations:
1. The removal of a node u produces a forest. The number of trees in the forest is the degree of u (since the tree is connected and the removal of u disconnects the graph into exactly deg(u) components, each being a tree).
2. For the forest to consist of pairwise identical trees, every tree must be identical to every other. Therefore, all the trees must have the same structure (i.e. they are isomorphic) and also the same size.

Therefore, when we remove a node u, we get deg(u) trees. For u to be a good cutting point:
   a) deg(u) must be at least 2 (given).
   b) The sizes of all the trees must be the same? Actually, note: it is possible that two trees have the same structure (are isomorphic) but have different sizes? The problem states "identical" meaning there must be a bijection that preserves edges. However, two trees of different sizes cannot have a bijection. Therefore, all the trees must have the same number of nodes.

But note: the entire tree has N nodes. When we remove u, the trees are the connected components. The sum of the sizes of these components must be N-1 (since we remove u). If we have deg(u) components and they are all of the same size, say s, then we must have: deg(u) * s = N-1.

So a necessary condition: (N-1) must be divisible by deg(u). Let k = deg(u). Then s = (N-1)/k must be an integer. And each component must have exactly s nodes.

Moreover, each of these k components must be isomorphic to each other.

Therefore, the problem reduces to:
  For each node u with degree k (>=2) such that (N-1) is divisible by k, we check:
      (i) The removal of u gives k connected components, each of size s = (N-1)/k.
      (ii) All these k components are pairwise isomorphic.

If u satisfies these conditions, then k (the number of components) is a candidate. We want the maximum k (over all good cutting points) that satisfies the condition.

However, note: the problem says "output the maximum number of disconnected trees that can be obtained by removing exactly one good cutting point". So if we have multiple good cutting points, we take the maximum k (which is the degree of u) that we can get. But note: k is the degree of u, and we are going over u.

But note: the same node u has a fixed k (its degree). So we will consider each u, and if u is good, then we have a candidate k = deg(u). Then we take the maximum candidate k over all u. However, note: the problem says "maximum number of disconnected trees", which is k. So we are to maximize k.

But note: k is at least 2. And k must divide (N-1). Therefore, we can precompute the divisors of (N-1) that are at least 2 and at most (N-1) (but note the degree of a node cannot exceed N-1, and in a tree the degree is at most N-1? Actually, for a tree of N nodes, the maximum degree is N-1, so that's acceptable).

However, note: the size of each component s = (N-1)/k must be at least 1. So k cannot exceed N-1.

Approach:

1. Precomputation: Read the tree and build an adjacency list.

2. We note that the candidate k must be a divisor of (N-1) and k>=2. So we can first find all divisors of (N-1) that are at least 2. Then for each node u with deg(u) = k (for such a divisor k) we check the conditions.

But note: the same k might appear in multiple nodes? Then we can take the maximum k over the nodes that satisfy the condition. However, note: we are to output the maximum k (the number of trees) that we can get by one removal. So if we have two good cutting points: one gives k1=2, the other gives k2=3, then we output 3.

But note: k is the degree of u, and the condition requires that (N-1) must be divisible by k. So if k is not a divisor of (N-1), we skip.

However, we can also consider: iterate over the divisors? Actually, we can iterate over the nodes. The total nodes is at most 4000. For each node u with deg(u) = k (and k>=2 and (N-1) divisible by k) we do:

   Step 1: Check that each connected component after removal of u has size s = (N-1)/k. How?
        We can do a BFS/DFS for each connected component? But note: we are going to remove u, then the components are the connected components of the graph without u. We can do a BFS/DFS starting from each neighbor of u? Actually, we can do one DFS (or BFS) that avoids u? But note: we are going to do this for every candidate u? That would be O(N) * O(N) = O(N^2) which is 4000^2 = 16e6, which might be acceptable in C++ but in Pyton might be borderline? However, the problem says N up to 4000, and worst-case 16e6 is acceptable in C++/Java but in Python we must be cautious. Alternatively, we can do a more efficient method.

   Alternatively, we can precompute the sizes of the subtrees for the entire tree? But note: the tree is arbitrary and u is arbitrary. We can root the tree arbitrarily and precompute a DFS tree? However, when we remove u, the components are the subtrees from each neighbor of u? Actually, if we root the tree at u, then each neighbor of u is the root of a branch. Then the entire tree (without u) is partitioned into the branches from each neighbor. The size of the branch from neighbor v would be the size of the subtree rooted at v (if we root the entire tree at u). So we can do:

        Precompute a DFS for the entire tree? But if we root at u, then we need to do for each u? That would be O(N) * O(N) again.

   We can do a single DFS to compute parent and subtree sizes for an arbitrary root? Then for a node u, the size of the component that includes neighbor v is: if v is the parent of u (in the rooted tree) then the component is the entire tree except the subtree of u. Otherwise, it's the subtree size of v. But note: we are going to root the tree arbitrarily, say at node 1. Then we can compute:

        size[u] = 1 + sum(size[v] for all children v)

   Then for a node u, the component corresponding to a neighbor v:

        If v is the parent of u, then the component has size = N - 1 - (the sum of the sizes of the children of u in the rooted tree? Actually, the entire tree without u: the part above u is N - size[u]. And the components below u are the subtrees of the children.

        However, note: the removal of u disconnects the tree. The component for the parent of u is the entire tree without the part that is the subtree of u (so size = N - 1 - (total subtree size of u without u) -> actually, the subtree of u (including u) is size[u]. So without u, the parent's component has size = N - size[u]. The other components (for the children) have size = size[child].

        Therefore, the sizes of the components are: 
            for each child of u (in the rooted tree): size[child]
            for the parent of u (if exists): N - size[u]

        But note: the rooted tree we fixed arbitrarily. And the condition requires that all components must have the same size s = (N-1)/k.

        Therefore, for u, we need:
            k = deg(u) (which is the number of neighbors) must be such that (N-1) is divisible by k -> so we skip if not.

        Then, we require that the sizes of all the components (which are the sizes of the subtrees of each neighbor of u, but note: the parent's component is N - size[u]) must be equal to s = (N-1)/k.

        However, note: the sum of the sizes of the components must be (N-1). So if all components are s, then we have k * s = N-1, which is satisfied.

        So step 1: Check that for every neighbor v of u, the size of the component (if v is the parent, then the component has size = N - size[u]; if v is a child, then the component has size = size[v]) is equal to s = (N-1)/k.

        But note: the rooted tree we fixed arbitrarily. So we must know the parent-child relationship for the entire tree. We can precompute the tree with root 1. Then we have parent and children arrays.

        However, when we consider u, if u is the root (node 1) then it has no parent. Then the components are all the subtrees of the children. And we require that each of these subtrees has size s = (N-1)/k, and also the parent component doesn't exist.

        So we can do:

            Precompute:
                parent[1] = 0
                Do a DFS from 1 to compute:
                    size[u] = 1 + sum(size[v] for v in children of u)

            Then for each node u:
                k = deg(u)   [which we can get from the adjacency list, but note: in the rooted tree, the degree is the number of neighbors, which is the number of children plus (if u is not root, then the parent).]

                If k>=2 and (N-1) % k == 0:
                    s = (N-1) // k
                    components = []
                    If u is not the root (i.e., has a parent), then the parent's component has size = N - size[u] -> if this is not s, skip.
                    For each child v of u (in the rooted tree), the component has size = size[v]. If any size[v] != s, then skip.

                Then we have the size condition satisfied.

        However, note: the DFS we did with root 1. The children of u in the rooted tree are the neighbors that are not the parent. But the component for a neighbor that is the parent is the entire tree without the subtree rooted at u. And the components for the children are the subtrees of the children.

        But what about a neighbor that is a child? The component for that child is the entire subtree of that child? Actually, when we remove u, the component that is the child's branch is the subtree of that child (which includes the child and all its descendants). And that is exactly what size[v] (for a child v) gives.

        So step 1: Check that all components have the same size s.

   Step 2: Check that all these components are pairwise isomorphic.

        This is the challenging part. Tree isomorphism for unrooted trees? Note: each component is a tree. But note: the component that comes from the parent's side: that tree is rooted at the parent? Actually, no. We have an unrooted tree. However, the problem requires the entire tree (the component) to be identical (meaning isomorphic as unrooted trees) to every other.

        We can use a known method for tree isomorphism: we can assign a canonical form (like a hash) to each tree. Then we compare the hashes. However, we must be cautious: the trees can be large (s = (N-1)/k, and k>=2, so s can be up to 2000? and k can be up to 4000? Actually, k is at least 2, so s <= (N-1)/2, which is about 2000. But the number of components k is the degree of u, which can be up to 4000. So we have k trees, each of size about 2000. Then we would need to compute the canonical form for each of these k trees? And k can be 4000? Then the total number of nodes in all trees is k * s = (N-1) = 3999, which is fixed. However, the work to compute the canonical form for one tree of size s is O(s). So the total work for one u would be O(k * s) = O(N-1) = O(N). So overall for all candidate u, the total work would be O(N^2). Since N=4000, then worst-case 4000 * 4000 = 16e6, which is acceptable.

        But note: the candidate u must satisfy the size condition. How many such u? The divisor condition: k = deg(u) must divide (N-1). The number of divisors of (N-1) is small (about O(sqrt(N))? So the total candidate u might be limited? Actually, no: the condition on the degree k is necessary but not sufficient. Also, even if k is a divisor, we require that all the components have size s. So the number of candidate u that pass the size condition might be small. However, worst-case: we might have to check for every u that has deg(u) a divisor of (N-1). The divisors of (N-1) are about O(sqrt(N)), so the total candidate u might be the number of nodes that have degree in the set of divisors? The set of divisors is small (say, at most 100). Then we have at most 4000 nodes, but only those with degree in a set of 100 divisors. So the total candidate u is at most 4000. But then for each candidate u we do O(N) work? Then total worst-case 4000*4000 = 16e6, which is acceptable.

        How to compute the canonical form for a tree? We can use a recursive method: we can compute a hash for a rooted tree and then use the method to represent the entire tree as an unrooted tree. However, the components we get are unrooted. But note: we can root each component arbitrarily? Actually, we can root the component at the neighbor of u? Why? Because the component is attached to u via an edge from u to v (where v is the neighbor). Then we can root the component at v? Then the entire component is a rooted tree with root v.

        But note: the problem does not require the trees to be rooted the same? The isomorphism is as unrooted trees. However, we can use the centroid to get a canonical representation? Or we can use the standard method: the AHU algorithm (rooted tree isomorphism) is not enough because the trees are unrooted.

        Alternatively, we can use the following for unrooted trees: 
            We can choose a center (if the tree has a center) and then represent the tree by the rooted tree at the center? But note: the tree might have two centers (if the diameter is even). Then we have to consider both? Then we can take the tuple of the two hashes and take the lexicographically smallest? 

        However, there is a simpler way: we can compute a hash that is invariant under isomorphism and independent of the root? 

        Actually, we can use the following: 
            We can represent the entire tree (the component) by the multiset of hashes of its subtrees (if we root it arbitrarily). But then we need to root the tree at a canonical node (like the center). 

        Standard method for unrooted tree isomorphism: 
          Step 1: Find the center(s) of the tree (there are at most 2).
          Step 2: Root the tree at the center (if one center) or at both centers (if two) and then take the minimum (or maximum) of the two representations? Then the canonical representation is the representation of the rooted tree at the center.

        How to compute the center? We can do: 
          Step: remove leaves layer by layer until 1 or 2 nodes remain.

        But note: the size s of the component might be up to 2000. We have k such components. Then the total work per candidate u is k * (s) = (N-1) = 3999. So we can do:

          For each component (tree T) of size s:
             Find the center(s) of T: 
                 Let deg[v] for each node in T? But note: we have the entire tree? Actually, we have to extract the component.

        How to extract the component? 
          We know: when we remove u, the component attached to neighbor v is the connected component that includes v. We can precompute the entire graph without u? Actually, we can do a BFS starting from v that does not go through u? But note: we have the entire graph. We can do:

            We mark u as off-limits. Then we do a BFS/DFS from v to collect all nodes in that component.

          Then we build the tree for that component? Actually, the component is a tree: the original tree without u, so the component is the connected component containing v. Then we can use the adjacency list (excluding u) to build the component.

        Then we can compute the center of that component? Then we root the tree at the center and compute a hash for the rooted tree.

        How to compute the hash for a rooted tree? 
          We can use a recursive function:

             f(u) = (1 + base * (product over children of (prime[f(child)])) mod mod   ... but that is not standard.

          Alternatively, we can use a tuple of sorted hashes? 

          Standard method: 
            We can assign a hash for a leaf as 1.
            Then for an internal node, we collect the hashes of its children, sort them (so that the order of children does not matter), and then combine them (for example, by a polynomial: h(u) = 1 + sum( h(v) * prime_i )? But this is not robust.

          There is a known method: 
            h(u) = 1 + sum_{v in children} h(v) * prime[count]   ... but then we need to sort the children? Actually, we can sort the children by their hash value? Then we can do:

            h(u) = 1
            for each child v (in increasing order of h(v)):
                h(u) = h(u) * base1 + h(v) * base2   ... and mod a large prime.

          But we want the representation to be independent of the order? Then we can use a commutative operation? 

          Actually, we can use the product of (prime[h(v)]) mod mod? But h(v) might be large. Alternatively, we can use a multiset of hashes and then use a polynomial that is symmetric? 

          A simpler method: use a tuple of the sorted list of the hashes of the children? Then recursively, the representation is a tuple (h(child1), h(child2), ...) sorted. Then we can map that to a number? Or we can use a dictionary to assign an id for each distinct tuple? (like the AHU algorithm). 

          However, we are not constrained by time? The total work for one component is O(s). And the total over all candidate u is O(N) per candidate, and the number of candidate u is the number of nodes that have deg(u) a divisor of (N-1) and then pass the size condition. The worst-case total work is O(N^2) = 16e6, which is acceptable.

        Steps for one component:

          Step 1: Extract the component. We do a BFS starting from v (the neighbor of u) without visiting u. We get the set of nodes in the component. Then we build the adjacency list for the component (excluding u and including the nodes we just found). Actually, we can avoid building the entire graph from scratch? We can use the original graph and mark u as not traversed. We'll have an array of visited for the entire graph? But we are doing this for each component for each candidate u? Then the total work might be O(N^2). How many candidate u? The divisor condition: the divisors of (N-1) are at most O(sqrt(N))? And each node u that has deg(u) in that divisor set. The worst-case: if (N-1) has many divisors? The maximum divisors for a number around 4000 is about 48? Then the candidate u: how many? The number of nodes that have a degree that is one of these divisors? The degrees of the nodes: the sum of degrees is 2*(N-1). The maximum degree is N-1. The number of nodes with a specific degree d: we can have at most O(N) nodes. So the total candidate u is at most 48 * (number of nodes with that degree) -> worst-case 48*N = 48*4000 = 192000. Then for each candidate u we do: 

            For each neighbor: extract the component (by BFS) and then compute the center and then compute the hash. The extraction: we do a BFS that avoids u. The BFS for one component: size s = (N-1)/k. The total work per candidate u: k * s = (N-1). So the total work over all candidate u: 192000 * (N-1) = 192000 * 3999 ~ 768e6, which is too high.

        We need a more efficient method.

        Alternative approach:

          We don't want to extract the entire component by BFS for every neighbor of every candidate u. 

        Let me restructure:

          Precomputation: 
            Precompute the entire tree as an adjacency list.
            Precompute the DFS tree from root 1: so we get parent and children arrays, and the size array.

          Then for candidate u: 
            We know the sizes of the components: 
                parent's component: N - size[u]   (if u is not root)
                each child v: size[v]

            Then we check that all these sizes are s = (N-1)/k. This is O(deg(u)).

          Then, we need to check that all the components are isomorphic. How to avoid building the entire component?

          Idea: We can precompute a hash for every node as the root of the entire tree? But then the removal of u breaks the tree. We want a hash for the component that is the branch starting at neighbor v without u. 

          Actually, we can precompute a tree hashing that is independent of the root? Or we can use a rerooting technique?

          We can use a method: 
            We precompute the tree with root 1, and then we precompute a hash for every subtree? But note: the component attached to a neighbor v (which is a child of u) is the entire subtree rooted at v? Actually, if we root the entire tree at u, then the component for v is the subtree of v (which we can precompute a hash for). But the component for the parent of u? That component is the entire tree without the subtree of u. How to compute a hash for that? 

          However, note: the component for the parent's side is not a rooted tree? But we can root the entire tree arbitrarily? Then the component for the parent's side can be represented as the entire tree without the subtree of u? How to compute a hash for that? 

          Alternatively, we can use the following: 
            We can root the entire tree at u. Then each component is the subtree of a neighbor? Then we can compute the hash for the subtree of each neighbor (with the root at the neighbor). Then the isomorphism condition is that the rooted trees (each rooted at the neighbor) are isomorphic? But note: the problem requires the trees to be isomorphic as unrooted trees. However, if we root each component at the neighbor (which is the node adjacent to u) then the unrooted isomorphism might be different? 

          But note: the edge between u and v is broken, so the component is unrooted. However, we can consider the rooted tree at v for the component? Then if two components (rooted at their respective v) are isomorphic as rooted trees, then the unrooted trees are isomorphic? Not necessarily: because the root is fixed at the neighbor. But if two rooted trees (with roots at the neighbors) are isomorphic as rooted trees, then the unrooted trees are isomorphic. However, the converse is not true: if the unrooted trees are isomorphic, then we can root them at the neighbor? But the neighbor might not be the center. 

          Therefore, we need to represent the entire unrooted tree. 

        Alternatively, we can compute a canonical representation for the entire unrooted tree without explicitly extracting the tree? 

        We can use a technique: 
          Precompute the centers of the component? But without building the component, how?

          Actually, we can do: 
            For the component that is the subtree of a child v (if we root the entire tree at u) is a rooted tree. But we want the unrooted tree. The center of the entire component? We can compute the diameter and the center? That would require building the entire tree? 

        Given the time constraints, and the fact that worst-case total work over candidate u is 16e6, we can do the following:

          We precompute the entire graph.

          For each candidate u (that passes the size condition) and for each neighbor v of u, we extract the component:

             We do a BFS: 
                 Let comp = []
                 queue: start with v, mark visited (for this BFS) and avoid u.
                 Then we traverse the graph (using the global adjacency list) without going to u.

          Then we build a tree for the component? Actually, we can build the adjacency list for the component: 
                 For each node x in the component, we list all neighbors y (from the global graph) that are in the component (so y != u and y is in the component).

          Then we compute the center(s) of this tree: 
                 We do: 
                    Let deg be the degree of each node in the component (which we get from the built adjacency list).
                    Then we remove leaves: we create a queue of leaves (nodes with deg=1). 
                    Then we remove leaves layer by layer. After removing all leaves, we update the degrees. We continue until we have 1 or 2 nodes. 

          Then we root the tree at the center (if one center) or at the two centers? Actually, for the canonical representation, we can root the tree at the center and then compute a hash for the rooted tree. If there are two centers, then we have two rooted trees? Then we take the minimum of the two hashes? 

          Then we compute the hash for the rooted tree at the center:

            We can use a recursive DFS (with memoization per tree structure? but note: the trees are small) to compute a hash that is invariant under reordering of children? 

            We do: 
              We define a function dfs(x, parent) that returns the hash of the subtree rooted at x.

              Then: 
                 Let children = all neighbors of x except parent.
                 Compute the list: [ dfs(child, x) for child in children ]
                 Sort that list of hashes (so that the order of children does not matter).
                 Then combine: 
                     h(x) = 1
                     for each value in the sorted list:
                         h(x) = (h(x) * base1 + value) % mod   [but this is order-dependent? we sorted so order is fixed]

                 Alternatively, we can do: 
                     h(x) = (1 + sum( h(child) * prime[i] ) mod mod   ... but then we need to sort.

                 Actually, we can do: 
                     h(x) = 1 + sum( h(child) )   ... but that is not unique.

          To get a good hash, we can use a well-known method: 

            h(x) = 1
            for each child hash c (in sorted order of the hashes? or we can sort the children by the hash value?):
                h(x) = (h(x) + f(c)) mod mod, where f is a function that scrambles the child hash? 

          A common method: 
            h(x) = (1 + sum_{child} h(child) * prime[0]) % mod   ... but then the same multiset of children with different hashes would yield the same? 

          Actually, we want to capture the multiset? Then we can use: 
            h(x) = 1 + sum_{child} h(child)   ... but then two different trees might have the same sum.

          Alternatively, we can use a polynomial that is symmetric? 

          There is a known method: 
            h(x) = \prod_{child} (prime[h(child)] + 1)   mod mod   ... but then we need a big prime mod to avoid collisions? 

          However, since the total number of distinct trees is not huge, and we are only comparing trees of the same size, we can use a double hash? 

          But note: the problem size is 4000, and we cannot have false positives.

          We can use a tuple of sorted hashes? Then we can map that tuple to an integer? But then we have to store the entire tuple? That would be expensive.

          Alternatively, we can use a hashing for multisets: 
             h(x) = 1
             for each child hash c (in increasing order of c):
                 h(x) = (h(x) * base + c) % mod

          This is a common method. 

          Steps for one tree (component):

            Step 1: Find the center(s). Let centers = the set of centers (1 or 2 nodes).
            Step 2: If there is one center, then root the tree at that center and compute the hash. If there are two centers, then we remove the edge between the two centers and consider two rooted trees: one at each center? Actually, we can do: 
                     root the tree at the first center and then at the second center and take the minimum (or maximum) of the two hashes? 

            But note: the unrooted tree is isomorphic regardless of which center we choose? Actually, no: we want a representation that is the same for isomorphic trees. So we can take the minimum of the two rooted hashes? 

            However, the problem: if we take the minimum, then two unrooted trees that are isomorphic will have the same minimum hash? 

            Actually, we can define the canonical hash for the unrooted tree as the minimum (or maximum) of the hashes of the tree rooted at each center? 

            Then: 
                If the tree has one center: then we compute the hash for the rooted tree at the center.
                If the tree has two centers: then we break the edge between the two centers? Actually, we can root the tree at the two centers and then combine the two hashes? 

            Alternatively, we can do: 
                Let the two centers be c1 and c2. Then the tree is symmetric about the edge (c1, c2). Then we can create a virtual root in the middle? Or we can compute the hash for the tree as two rooted trees: one rooted at c1 and one rooted at c2? Then the entire tree is the combination of two rooted trees? 

            Actually, we can consider: 
                We root the tree at c1, then the children of c1 include c2? Then we compute the hash for the entire tree rooted at c1. Then we root the tree at c2, and compute the hash. Then the canonical hash is the minimum of these two? 

            Then for two trees to be isomorphic, we require that the minimum hash from the two centers is the same? 

            But note: if we do that, then two trees that are isomorphic will have the same canonical hash? 

            However, we can simply do: 
                Let h1 = hash_tree(center1, parent = -1)   [if we root at center1]
                Let h2 = hash_tree(center2, parent = -1)   [if we root at center2]
                Then the canonical hash = min(h1, h2)

            Then we compare the canonical hash of the two components.

          Steps for one component:

            Build the tree (the set of nodes and the adjacency list without u).

            Find centers:
                Let deg be the degree of each node in the component (which we can get from the built adj list).
                Let Q be a queue of leaves (deg=1).
                Let layer = 0 and an array of levels? Actually, we can do:

                    Let n = s (the size of the component)
                    Let leaves = all nodes with deg=1.
                    Then we remove leaves and update deg until we have 0,1, or 2 nodes.

                The centers are the last one or two nodes.

            Then if one center: 
                h = dfs(center, -1)   [using the built tree and the hash function for rooted trees]

            If two centers: 
                h1 = dfs(center1, -1)   [but note: when we root at center1, then center2 is a child of center1? Actually, we break the edge between center1 and center2? We can do: 
                    We consider the entire tree. We root at center1: then center2 is a neighbor. Then we compute the hash for center1, and we do not go to center2? Actually, we have to include center2? 

                How? Actually, we break the edge between the two centers? Then the tree splits? But no: the centers are adjacent? Then we can root the tree at center1 and then center2 becomes one of the children? Then we compute the hash for center1? Similarly for center2.

                Then we take the minimum of h1 and h2.

            Then the canonical representation of the component is (min_hash) if two centers we take min(h1, h2); if one center we take h.

          But note: we can also do without breaking the edge: the entire tree is connected. When we root at center1, we include center2 as a child? Then we do the DFS normally? 

          Actually, yes: the entire component is connected. The two centers are connected by an edge. When we root at center1, the tree is: center1 has children including center2? Then we compute the hash for the entire tree rooted at center1. Similarly for center2.

          Then we compare the min(h1, h2) for each component.

          Then for candidate u: we have k components, each with a canonical hash. Then we check that all these k hashes are the same.

          Then we record k = deg(u) as a candidate.

        Then we take the maximum candidate k over all u.

        If we find no candidate u, output -1.

        However, note: the problem says "output the maximum number of disconnected trees that can be obtained by removing exactly one good cutting point". This k is the number of trees (which is deg(u)). So we want the maximum k.

        But note: we are iterating over u. We can simply:

            ans = -1
            for each node u:
                k = deg(u)
                if k>=2 and (N-1) % k == 0:
                    s = (N-1)//k
                    // Check the size condition: 
                         parent_component_size = N - size[u]   (if u is not root, else skip)
                         for each child v of u: if size[v] != s -> break
                         if u is root: then no parent_component, so all children must be s.
                         if u is not root: then parent_component_size must be s and each child must be s.

                    if the size condition fails: skip.

                    Then, for each neighbor v of u (which are the same as the children in the rooted tree plus the parent? But note: the neighbors: we have the entire list. Actually, we can iterate over the entire neighbor list? But we have to extract the component for each neighbor.

                    Then we build the component for each neighbor (by BFS avoiding u) and then compute the canonical hash.

                    Then we check that all the canonical hashes are the same.

                    If they are the same: then candidate = k, and we update ans = max(ans, candidate)

            Then if ans is still -1, output -1; else output ans.

        But note: the same component might be built twice? For example, if u has two neighbors that are in the same component? No, because the removal of u disconnects the graph: each neighbor v is the root of one distinct component. So we have exactly one component per neighbor.

        However, note: the component for a neighbor v is built from the BFS starting at v (avoiding u). Then we build the entire connected component that includes v.

        Implementation details:

          We need to avoid building the entire graph for each component? The total work for one candidate u is O(deg(u) * s) = O(N) per candidate u. And the total candidate u might be the number of nodes with deg(u) in the divisor set. The worst-case total work: the sum over candidate u of (N) = (number of candidate u) * N. The number of candidate u: the divisors of (N-1) are at most about 100? Then the candidate u: each divisor d, and the nodes with deg(u)=d. The number of nodes with a fixed degree d: the average is about 2*(N-1)/N, which is about 2. So the total candidate u is about 100 * 2 = 200? Then the total work is 200 * 4000 = 800000, which is acceptable.

        Steps:

          Precomputation:
            Read N and edges.
            Build adj: a list of lists for the graph.
            Precompute the DFS tree from node 0 (if we index nodes from 0 to N-1) or 1 to N? The input: nodes are 1-indexed.

            Let's index nodes from 0 to N-1.

            Precompute:
                parent = [-1] * N
                size = [0] * N
                children = [[] for _ in range(N)]

            We do a BFS/DFS from 0 (root 0).

          Then:
            deg = [len(adj[i]) for i in range(N)]   # the degree of each node

            divisors = []   # the divisors of (N-1) that are at least 2
            for d in range(2, N):
                if (N-1) % d == 0:
                    divisors.append(d)

            ans = -1

            For each node u in range(N):
                k = deg[u]
                if k < 2: 
                    continue
                if (N-1) % k != 0:
                    continue
                s = (N-1) // k

                # Check the size condition for the components:

                # We have the DFS tree with root 0. We know:
                #   If u==0 (root): then the parent_component does not exist. The components are the subtrees of the children.
                #   Else: the parent_component has size = N - size[u]   [because size[u] is the size of the subtree rooted at u (including u)].

                # But note: the component for a child v is size[v] (the size of the subtree rooted at v). However, the DFS we did: the children of u are stored? 

                # Actually, we have the array 'children' for each node.

                # However, the DFS tree we built: the children of u are the neighbors that are not the parent. But the parent's component is the rest. 

                # But note: the component for a neighbor that is not a child (i.e., the parent) is the parent_component. And the children of u are the neighbors that are children.

                # How many neighbors? The total neighbors = deg[u]. 

                # We need to check:
                #   If u is not the root (i.e., parent[u] != -1), then the parent_component must have size = s.
                #   For each child v in children[u]: the subtree size must be s.

                # But note: the size of the subtree of a child v is stored in size[v]. 

                # However, what about the entire component? The component for a child v is exactly the subtree of v? Yes, because we rooted at 0, and u is not the root? Actually, if u is not the root, then the parent's component is the entire tree without the subtree of u. And the children's components are the subtrees of the children.

                # But if u is the root, then there is no parent component.

                # Therefore:

                valid_size = True
                if u == 0:
                    # then no parent component
                    for v in children[u]:
                        if size[v] != s:
                            valid_size = False
                            break
                else:
                    if (N - size[u]) != s:
                        valid_size = False
                    else:
                        for v in children[u]:
                            if size[v] != s:
                                valid_size = False
                                break

                if not valid_size:
                    continue

                # Now, we have to check the isomorphism of the k components.

                # The components: 
                #   For each neighbor v of u (in the original graph, not just children) we have a component? Actually, the neighbors of u are the same as the set: 
                #       if u is the root: neighbors = children[u]
                #       else: neighbors = children[u] + [parent[u]]

                # But note: the DFS tree: the parent of u is stored in parent[u]. The children are stored in children[u]. The total neighbors = children[u] and the parent? 

                # Actually, the adjacency list for u: we have all neighbors. So we can iterate over adj[u] to get all neighbors.

                # However, we built the DFS tree from root 0. The parent of u is fixed. But the neighbors in the original graph are stored in adj[u]. So we can simply iterate over adj[u].

                # But note: we need to build the component for each neighbor? 

                # We will do:

                comp_hashes = []   # list to store the canonical hash for each component (one per neighbor)

                    #   For each node in comp_nodes, we add an edge to a neighbor (that is in comp_nodes) for every neighbor in adj[node] that is in comp_nodes (and not u).

                            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                                if neighbor in comp_set and deg_comp_temp[neighbor] > 0: 
                                    deg_comp_temp[neighbor] -= 1
                                    if deg_comp_temp[neighbor] == 1:
                                        leaves.append(neighbor)
                        # end for
                    # Now, the centers are the remaining nodes in leaves? Actually, after the loop, the leaves become the centers? 
                    centers = list(leaves)   # the centers: 1 or 2 nodes.

                    # Now, we want to compute the hash for the entire component. We have two centers? Then we compute the hash for the tree rooted at each center and take the minimum.

                    # We define a function dfs(x, parent, comp_set, global_adj) that returns the hash of the subtree rooted at x.

                    # We'll use a recursive DFS. We use a tuple representation? Or we can use a polynomial hash? 

                    # We'll do: 
                    #   We use a base and a modulus. We use two mods to reduce collisions? 

                    # But note: the problem constraints are not huge, so one modulus might be enough? However, we can use a double hash.

                    # However, to be safe, we can use two mods? 

                    # We define:
                    mod1 = 10**9+7
                    mod2 = 10**9+9
                    base = 131   # a prime

                    # But we want to combine the children? 

                    # We can do: 
                    #   Let h1(x) = 1
                    #   Let h2(x) = 1
                    #   Let child_hashes = []
                    #   For each neighbor in adj[x]:
                    #       if neighbor == parent or neighbor not in comp_set:   # but note: the comp_set is the entire component? and we are traversing only the component? 
                    #           continue
                    #       Then we get the hash for the child: (h1_child, h2_child) = dfs(neighbor, x, comp_set, global_adj)
                    #       Then we push (h1_child, h2_child) to child_hashes
                    #   Sort child_hashes by (h1_child, h2_child) to get a canonical order?
                    #   Then for each (a,b) in sorted(child_hashes):
                    #       h1(x) = (h1(x) * base + a) % mod1
                    #       h2(x) = (h2(x) * base + b) % mod2

                    #   Then return (h1(x), h2(x))

                    # However, the base and the modulus: we want to capture the entire structure.

                    # But note: the component is of size s, which can be up to 2000. The base is 131, then the hash value for a tree of depth d might be 131^d? That is too big? So we do modulus.

                    # We'll write a DFS function:

                        # x is the current node, parent is the parent in the DFS tree.

                                continue
                            ch = dfs_hash(neighbor, x, comp_set, global_adj, base, mod1, mod2)
                            child_hashes.append(ch)
                        # Sort the child_hashes: by the tuple (ch1, ch2) to make it canonical?
                        child_hashes.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
                        h1_val = 1

                            h1_val = (h1_val * base + a) % mod1
                            h2_val = (h2_val * base + b) % mod2
                        return (h1_val, h2_val)

                    # But note: if we have two centers, we do two DFS? 

                    # If one center: 
                    if len(centers) == 1:
                        c = centers[0]
                        hash_comp = dfs_hash(c, -1, comp_set, adj, base, mod1, mod2)
                    else:
                        c1, c2 = centers
                        # For center1: 
                        h1 = dfs_hash(c1, -1, comp_set, adj, base, mod1, mod2)

                    comp_hashes.append(hash_comp)

                # End for each neighbor v

                # Now, check that all comp_hashes are the same? 
                all_same = True
                first = comp_hashes[0]
                for h_val in comp_hashes[1:]:
                    if h_val != first:
                        all_same = False
                        break

                if all_same:
                    if k > ans:
                        ans = k

            # End for each node u

            print(ans)   # if no candidate found, then ans remains -1.

        However, note: the DFS_hash function is recursive and the depth might be large? We can use iterative DFS? Or we can use a stack? The size of the component is at most 2000, so recursion depth 2000 is acceptable in Pyton? But we might get recursion limits? We can set recursion limit? Or we use iterative DFS.

        Alternatively, we can use BFS for the DFS_hash? Actually, we can do a bottom-up (from leaves to center) for the entire component? 

        We can use a topological order (by the degree in the component) and then compute the hash from the leaves up? 

        Steps for one component (without recursion):

          We know the centers? But we want to compute the hash from the leaves up? 

          We can do:

            We create an array dp1 and dp2 for the hash values? 
            We start from the leaves? 

          Actually, we can do:

            We create a queue (for leaves) and then process from the bottom up.

          But note: we have the entire tree and we know the parent? But we don't have a fixed root? 

          Alternatively, we can use the following iterative method:

            We maintain an array "order" that is the reverse of the BFS order (from the center outwards) but we want from leaves to center.

            Actually, we can do:

                We do a BFS (using the centers as the roots) and then go from the leaves backwards? 

          Given the complexity and the fact that the component size is at most 2000, we can use recursion? But to avoid recursion depth, we can use iterative DFS? 

          We'll use iterative DFS for the entire component? 

          But note: the DFS_hash function we wrote is recursive. We can change it to iterative:

            We need to compute the hash for each node in postorder.

          Steps for one center:

            We root the tree at the center (if one center) or at one of the centers (if two) and then we do a BFS to get the order? Actually, we can do:

                Let parent = [-1] * N   for the DFS tree for this component.
                Let stack = [center]
                Let order = []   # we will get the nodes in reverse order (leaves first, then center last)
                Let children_tree = [[] for _ in range(N)]

                # First, we build the tree: 
                #   We do a BFS/DFS from the center? 
                #   We do a BFS:

                from collections import deque
                q = deque([center])
                parent_comp = [-1] * N
                parent_comp[center] = -1
                while q:
                    node = q.popleft()
                    order.append(node)
                    for neighbor in adj[node]:
                        if neighbor == u:   # but u is not in comp_set? so we skip? 
                            continue
                        if neighbor == parent_comp[node]:
                            continue
                        parent_comp[neighbor] = node
                        children_tree[node].append(neighbor)
                        q.append(neighbor)

                # But this is a BFS order? We want the children to be processed first? Then we need the reverse of the order? 

                # Actually, we can reverse the order list: then we process from leaves to center.

                # Then we initialize for each node: 
                    h1[node] = 1
                    h2[node] = 1
                Then for node in reversed(order):
                    # Collect the children: 
                    child_hashes = []
                    for child in children_tree[node]:
                        ch = (h1[child], h2[child])
                        child_hashes.append(ch)
                    child_hashes.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
                    for a,b in child_hashes:
                        h1[node] = (h1[node] * base + a) % mod1
                        h2[node] = (h2[node] * base + b) % mod2

                Then the hash for the center is (h1[center], h2[center])

          But note: if we have two centers, we do the same for both centers and then take the min.

        However, to keep the code simpler, we can use recursion and hope that the recursion depth (2000) is acceptable? 

        But note: Python recursion limit is typically 1000. So we need to increase the recursion limit? Or use iterative.

        Alternatively, we can avoid recursion by using an iterative DFS (postorder) for the entire component? 

        We can do:

            stack = [ (node, parent, list of neighbors) ] 

        We'll write an iterative version for dfs_hash for one root.

        Steps for one root (r) in the component:

            # Build the DFS tree from r (avoiding the parent and u, but u is not in the component).
            stack = [r]
            parent = [-1] * N
            children_tree = [[] for _ in range(N)]
            visited = [False] * N
            visited[r] = True
            order = []
            while stack:
                node = stack.pop()
                order.append(node)
                for neighbor in adj[node]:
                    if neighbor == parent[node] or not (neighbor in comp_set) or neighbor == u:
                        continue
                    parent[neighbor] = node
                    children_tree[node].append(neighbor)
                    visited[neighbor] = True
                    stack.append(neighbor)

            # Then we reverse the order: because we popped from the stack, we got the nodes in a DFS order? But we want the leaves first? 
            # We can reverse the order list? 
            order.reverse()   # so we go from leaves to root.

            h1 = [1] * N
            h2 = [1] * N

            for node in order:
                # collect the child hashes for the children of node
                child_hashes = []
                for child in children_tree[node]:
                    child_hashes.append( (h1[child], h2[child]) )
                child_hashes.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
                for a,b in child_hashes:
                    h1[node] = (h1[node] * base + a) % mod1
                    h2[node] = (h2[node] * base + b) % mod2

            return (h1[node], h2[node])   # at the root?

        But note: we are processing the node in the reversed order (leaves first), so when we process a node, its children have been processed.

        Then we return the hash for the root.

        We'll use this iterative method to avoid recursion.

        Summary:

          We iterate over candidate u (nodes that have deg[u]>=2 and (N-1)%deg[u]==0 and then pass the size condition).

          For each candidate u, for each neighbor v:
             Extract the component (by BFS avoiding u) -> we get comp_set and comp_nodes.
             Build the component's graph? We only need the comp_set to know which nodes are in, and then we use the global adj (avoiding u and nodes not in the set) to build the tree for the center finding and for the hash.

             Then find the centers of the component (by the leaf removal algorithm).

             Then for each center (if two centers, then for both) we compute the hash of the tree rooted at that center using the iterative DFS method described above? 

             Then the canonical hash for the component is the min of the two hashes (if two centers) or the hash of the center (if one).

          Then we check that all the components (for all neighbors) have the same canonical hash.

          Then update ans = max(ans, deg[u])

        Finally, output ans (or -1 if no candidate found).

        Note: It is possible that the same component structure appears for multiple neighbors? Then the hashes will be the same.

        We must be cautious for hash collisions. We use a double hash (two mods) to reduce the probability.

        Time: The total work for one candidate u is O(deg(u)*s) = O(N) per candidate u. And the total candidate u is at most O(N) (if there are many divisors and many nodes have those degrees). But the divisors of (N-1) are at most O(sqrt(N)), and the number of nodes with a specific degree d: the average is 2, so the total candidate u is about 2 * (#divisors). The worst-case #divisors is about 48 (for N-1=4000: divisors: 4000 has about 30 divisors). Then total candidate u is about 60. Then the total work is 60 * (N) = 60*4000 = 240000. And for each component we do a BFS for extraction and a BFS for center and a BFS for the iterative DFS_hash. The BFS for extraction: O(s). The center: O(s). The iterative DFS_hash: O(s). Then for one candidate u: deg(u) * O(s) = k * s = N-1 = 3999. Then total work: 60 * 3999 = 240000, which is acceptable.

        Let's test with the sample: 
            N=13, then (N-1)=12. Divisors: 2,3,4,6,12. 
            Then we look for nodes with degree in {2,3,4,6,12}. 
            The sample tree: 
                Edges: 
                  1-5, 1-7, 2-4, 2-8, 2-11, 3-12, 4-7, 4-12, 6-11, 7-13, 9-10, 9-12.

            We can compute the degrees: 
                node1: edges: 5,7 -> deg=2.
                node2: 4,8,11 -> deg=3.
                node3: 12 -> deg=1 -> skip.
                node4: 2,7,12 -> deg=3.
                node5: 1 -> deg=1 -> skip.
                node6: 11 -> deg=1 -> skip.
                node7: 1,4,13 -> deg=3.
                node8: 2 -> deg=1 -> skip.
                node9: 10,12 -> deg=2.
                node10: 9 -> deg=1 -> skip.
                node11: 2,6 -> deg=2.
                node12: 3,4,9 -> deg=3.
                node13: 7 -> deg=1 -> skip.

            Then candidate u: nodes with degree in {2,3,4,6,12}: 
                node1: deg=2 -> 12%2==0 -> s=6. Then check sizes: 
                    For node1: 
                        It is not the root? Let's root the entire tree arbitrarily (say at node0: node1 is index0?).

                We need to compute the DFS tree from root 0 (node1). 
                Then for node1 (index0): 
                    parent_component? Since it is the root, no parent. 
                    Children: in the DFS tree: 
                        node1's children: 
                            Let's see: 
                                edges: 1-5, 1-7 -> so children: 5 (index4) and 7 (index6) -> but we have to do a DFS.

                Actually, we should build the DFS tree from node1 (0-indexed: node0).

                The DFS tree for the entire tree: 
                    Root: node0 (node1)
                    Children of node0: [4,6]  (if we go to node5 and node7: node5 is node4 in 0-index? and node7 is node6?).

                Then the subtree sizes: 
                    size[4] (node5) = 1? 
                    size[6] (node7) = ...? 
                    But we need the entire subtree: 
                        node7 (index6) is connected to node0 (node1), node3 (node4) and node12 (node13? actually node13) -> wait, let me map:

                The nodes: 
                    node1:0, node2:1, node3:2, node4:3, node5:4, node6:5, node7:6, node8:7, node9:8, node10:9, node11:10, node12:11, node13:12.

                Then the edges:
                    0-4, 0-6, 
                    1-3, 1-7, 1-10, 
                    2-11, 
                    3-6, 3-11, 
                    5-10, 
                    6-12, 
                    8-9, 8-11.

                Then the DFS tree from node0 (node1):
                    Start at 0: 
                        neighbors: 4,6 -> then children: 4,6.
                    Then from 4: 
                        neighbors: ...? 
                    Actually, we need to build the entire tree.

                Alternatively, we can skip the sample by hand? 

                The sample says node4 (index3) is the good cutting point. 
                For node3 (0-indexed for node4): 
                    deg[3] = 3 -> which is a divisor of 12? 12/3=4. 
                    Then we check the sizes: 
                        If we root the entire tree at node0 (node1) then:
                            parent[3] = 1 (node2) -> so u=3 is not the root.
                            parent_component: N - size[3] = 13 - size[3] = 13 - (size of the subtree of node3) 

                    How to compute size[3]: 
                        The subtree of node3: 
                            node3 (node4) has children: in the DFS tree? 
                            We built the tree from root0: 
                                We start at 0: 
                                    then go to 4 (node5) and 6 (node7). 
                                Then from 6 (node7): 
                                    neighbors: 0 (parent), 3 (node4), 12 (node13) -> so we add 3? and 12? 
                                But then we get to node3 (index3) from node6? 
                                Then from node3: 
                                    neighbors: 6 (parent), 11 (node12) -> then add 11? 
                                Then from 11: 
                                    neighbors: 3 (parent), 8 (node9) -> then add 8? 
                                Then from 8: 
                                    neighbors: 11 (parent), 9 (node10) -> then add 9? 
                                Then from 9: 
                                    neighbors: 8 (parent) -> done.

                            Actually, this is messy.

                Instead, we trust the sample: node4 (index3) is the good cutting point.

        Implementation:

          We'll do:

            Precomputation: 
                Read N, build graph (0-indexed)

            Precompute a DFS tree for the entire tree from node0 (root0) to get parent and children and size arrays.

            Precompute divisors = all divisors d in [2, N-1] of (N-1)

            deg = [len(graph[i]) for i in range(N)]

            ans = -1

            Precomputation for the DFS tree: 
                We do a BFS starting from 0:

                    parent = [-1] * N
                    size = [0] * N
                    children = [[] for _ in range(N)]

                    stack = [0]   # or queue
                    parent[0] = -1
                    order = []
                    # We use a stack for DFS? or BFS? 
                    # We do BFS for tree building:

                    from collections import deque
                    q = deque([0])
                    while q:
                        u = q.popleft()
                        order.append(u)
                        size[u] = 1
                        for v in graph[u]:
                            if v == parent[u]:
                                continue
                            parent[v] = u
                            children[u].append(v)
                            q.append(v)

                    # Then we compute size in reverse order: 
                    for u in reversed(order):
                        for v in children[u]:
                            size[u] += size[v]

            Then for each node u in range(N):
                k = deg[u]
                if k<2: continue
                if (N-1) % k != 0: continue
                s = (N-1)//k

                # Check size condition:
                if u == 0:
                    # no parent component
                    valid = True
                    for v in children[u]:
                        if size[v] != s:
                            valid = False
                            break
                else:

                                break

                if not valid: 
                    continue

        Let me test with Sample Input #2: 
            Input: 
                6
                1 2
                1 3
                2 4
                3 5
                3 6

            This is a star tree? 
                node1 is the center? 
                deg[0] = 2?  (if node1 is index0) -> but wait: 
                Nodes: 
                  1:0, 2:1, 3:2, 4:3, 5:4, 6:5.

                Edges: 
                  0-1, 0-2, 1-3, 2-4, 2-5.

                Then deg[0]=2, deg[1]=2, deg[2]=3, deg[3]=1, deg[4]=1, deg[5]=1.

                (N-1)=5. Divisors: none? because 5 is prime? divisors: only 5? but 5>=2 -> divisor 5.

                Candidate u: 
                  u must have deg[u] in {5}. 
                  The degrees: no node has degree 5? 

                Then no candidate.

                Output: -1.

            So it matches.

        We'll code accordingly.

        Note: We use two mods: mod1=10**9+7, mod2=10**9+9, base=131.

        However, we can choose a larger base? and two large primes? 

        But the constraints are 4000, and the tree size s is up to 2000. The chance of collision is low.

        We'll do as described.

        Time: The total work: the candidate u: the number of u with deg[u] a divisor of (N-1) and then passing the size condition. Then for each such u, we do k (which is deg[u]) * O(s) = O(N). The total candidate u: at most O(N) worst-case? But the divisors are about 100, and the number of nodes with a specific degree is about 2, so total 200. Then 200*4000 = 800000, which is acceptable.

        We'll hope that the size condition fails for most u.

        Let's run the sample of 13 nodes.

        We'll try to run on the sample.

        Steps for u = node4 (which is index3) in the sample:

            deg[3]=3 -> divisor of 12: 12/3=4 -> s=4.

            Check size condition: 
                u=3 is not the root? 
                parent_component: N - size[3] = 13 - size[3]. 
                What is size[3]? 
                    We built the DFS tree from root0 (node1). 
                    How we built? 
                        We start at 0: 
                            neighbors: 4 (node5) and 6 (node7) -> then children: 4,6.
                        Then 4: 
                            neighbors: 0 (parent) -> done -> size[4]=1.
                        Then 6: 
                            neighbors: 0 (parent), 3 (node4), 12 (node13) -> then we go to 3 and 12? 
                        Then 3: 
                            neighbors: 6 (parent), 1 (node2), 11 (node12) -> then we go to 1 and 11? 
                        Then 1: 
                            neighbors: 3 (parent), 7 (node8), 10 (node11) -> then we go to 7,10? 
                        Then 7: 
                            neighbors: 1 (parent) -> done -> size[7]=1.
                        Then 10: 
                            neighbors: 1 (parent) -> done -> size[10]=1.
                        Then 11: 
                            neighbors: 3 (parent), 5 (node6) -> then we go to 5? 
                        Then 5: 
                            neighbors: 11 (parent) -> done -> size[5]=1.
                        Then 12: 
                            neighbors: 6 (parent), 8 (node9) -> then we go to 8? 
                        Then 8: 
                            neighbors: 12 (parent), 9 (node10) -> then we go to 9? 
                        Then 9: 
                            neighbors: 8 (parent) -> done -> size[9]=1.

                    Now, the sizes in reverse order: 
                        leaves: 
                            size[9]=1, size[8]=1+1=2? 
                            Then size[12]=1+size[8]=1+2=3? 
                            Then size[6]=1+ (size[3]? not computed) -> wait, we do in reversed BFS order? 

                    Actually, we did a BFS: the order: 
                        0, then 4,6, then 3,12, then 1,11, then 7,10,5, then 8, then 9? 
                    Then reversed: 9,8,5,10,7,11,1,12,3,6,4,0.

                    Then we compute:
                        size[9]=1
                        size[8]=1+size[9]=2
                        size[5]=1
                        size[10]=1
                        size[7]=1
                        size[11]=1+size[5]=2
                        size[1]=1+size[7]+size[10]=1+1+1=3
                        size[12]=1+size[8]=1+2=3
                        size[3]=1+size[1]+size[11]? = 1+3+2=6
                        size[6]=1+size[3]+size[12] = 1+6+3 = 10
                        size[4]=1
                        size[0]=1+size[4]+size[6] = 1+1+10 = 12.

                    Then for node3 (index3): 
                        parent_component: N - size[3] = 13 - 6 = 7 -> not 4 -> fails the size condition? 

            But wait, the sample says node4 (which we are representing as index3) has three components of size 4? 

            What's the issue? 

            Our DFS tree is built from root0 (node1). The parent_component for node3 is the entire tree without the subtree of node3? 
            The subtree of node3: 
                The subtree of node3: 
                    node3, and then its children: node1 and node11? 
                Then the parent_component is the entire tree without the subtree of node3? 
                    But the tree has 13 nodes, the subtree of node3 has 6 nodes? Then 13-6=7? 

            Why is the sample component size 4? 

            The sample says: 
                By removing node4 (node3 in 0-indexed), we get three components: 
                    A: {5,1,7,13} -> which are nodes: 4,0,6,12 -> 4 nodes.
                    B: {8,2,11,6} -> nodes: 7,1,10,5 -> 4 nodes? 
                    C: {3,12,9,10} -> nodes: 2,11,8,9 -> 4 nodes.

            How do we get these? 
                The component attached to neighbor node2 (which is the parent of node4? in the original tree) is not the entire tree without the subtree? 

            Actually, the DFS tree we built (with root0) is arbitrary. The removal of u (node3) disconnects the tree. The components are:

                Component attached to the parent of u (which is node6, index6) in the DFS tree? 
                    But the parent of u in the DFS tree is node6? 
                Component attached to the child node1 (index1) and node11 (index10).

            But the parent in the DFS tree is not the same as the parent in the original tree? 

            The issue: the DFS tree we built is arbitrary. The parent_component is defined as the entire tree without the subtree of u? This is only valid in the DFS tree? 

            However, the problem: the removal of u disconnects the tree. The component that contains the parent of u (in the DFS tree) is the entire tree without the subtree of u? 

            But note: the tree is not directed. The parent in the DFS tree is arbitrary.

            How to compute the size of the component attached to a neighbor? 
                The component attached to neighbor v (which is a neighbor of u) is the connected component that contains v after removing u. 

                We can do: 
                    The size of the component that includes v is the size of the connected component that we extracted by BFS? 

            But in the size condition, we did: 
                For the parent (if exists): the size is N - size[u]   (in the DFS tree) -> which we computed as 7? 
                But when we extracted the component attached to the parent (node6) we got: 
                    Start from node6: 
                        node6: then from 6: neighbors: 0,3,12 -> but we avoid 3? 
                        So: 6->0? (but 0 is node1) and then 0->4 (node5) -> then 0->? 
                    Actually, the component attached to node6: 
                        It includes: 6,0,4,12? 
                        Then 0: connected to 4? 
                        12: connected to 8, then 8 connected to 9? 
                    So the nodes: 6,0,4,12,8,9 -> 6 nodes? 

            This is messy.

            Alternative: 
                We can compute the size of the component by doing a BFS that avoids u? Then we get the size as the number of nodes in the BFS. 

            We did extract the component by BFS for the isomorphism check. But we did it for the size condition? 

            Why not use the size from the BFS extraction for the size condition? 

            We can do: 
                For each neighbor v: 
                    Extract the component (by BFS) and get the size = |comp_set|? 
                Then we check that for every neighbor v, |comp_set| = s = (N-1)/k.

            Then we don't need the DFS tree for the size condition? 

            Then we can skip the entire DFS tree building for the entire tree? 

            Steps for candidate u: 
                k = deg[u] (>=2 and divisor of (N-1))
                s = (N-1)//k

                For each neighbor v of u: 
                    Do a BFS (avoiding u) starting at v to get the connected component. 
                    Let size_comp = number of nodes in the component.
                    If size_comp != s: then skip u.

                Then we proceed to check the isomorphism.

            This is more robust.

            But note: the total work: 
                For candidate u: we do k * O(N) for BFS? Then total O(k * N) = O(N^2) per candidate u? 
                And the total candidate u: worst-case 4000 nodes? Then total work 4000 * 4000 * 4000 = 64e9? -> too high.

            We need to avoid.

            But note: we are doing BFS for each neighbor of u, but the entire graph is partitioned. The entire graph without u is partitioned into k components. And the BFS for one neighbor v will cover the entire component. Then when we do the next neighbor, we can skip the nodes that we have already visited? 

            We can do one BFS that avoids u and marks which component each node belongs to? And also we can get the size of each component? 

            Then for candidate u: 
                We do one BFS (avoiding u) that covers the entire graph without u. 
                Then we get the components: the starting point for each component is the neighbor of u? 
                Actually, the components are attached to the neighbors.

                Steps:
                  Let comp_sizes = []
                  Let visited = [False]*N, with visited[u]=True.
                  For each neighbor v of u:
                      If v is not visited: 
                          Do a BFS from v to get the entire component, and record the size.
                          Then comp_sizes.append(size)
                  Then check that every size in comp_sizes is s, and the number of components is k? 

                Then we also have to collect the components for the isomorphism: but we did the BFS, we can store the comp_set for each neighbor? 

            Then we do:

                visited = [False] * N
                visited[u] = True
                comps = []   # list of comp_set for each component? 
                for v in graph[u]:
                    if not visited[v]:
                        comp_set = set()
                        queue = deque([v])
                        visited[v] = True
                        comp_set.add(v)
                        while queue:
                            node = queue.popleft()
                            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                                if not visited[neighbor] and neighbor != u: 
                                    visited[neighbor] = True
                                    comp_set.add(neighbor)
                                    queue.append(neighbor)
                        comps.append(comp_set)

                Then we have the components. The number of components should be the same as deg[u]? 
                But note: it is possible that the BFS for one neighbor v covers multiple neighbors? No, because the removal of u disconnects the graph, so each neighbor is in a separate component.

                Actually, we start from v, and we cover the entire component that contains v. And then we mark all nodes in that component. Then the next neighbor that is not visited must be in a different component.

                Then we get exactly k components? 

                Then we check: 
                    if len(comps) != k: # should not happen, but skip?
                    for comp in comps:
                        if len(comp) != s:
                            valid_size = False
                            break

            Then if valid_size, we proceed to compute the canonical hash for each comp in comps.

            This is one BFS for the entire graph without u? Then the work per candidate u: O(N). Then total candidate u: 200 * 4000 = 800000, which is acceptable.

            Then we don't need the DFS tree for the entire tree? 

            We can skip the initial DFS tree.

            Revised plan:

                Precomputation: 
                    Read N, build graph (0-indexed)

                Precomputation: divisors = all divisors d (>=2) of (N-1)

                ans = -1

                For u in range(N):
                    k = deg[u]
                    if k<2: continue
                    if (N-1) % k != 0: continue
                    s = (N-1)//k

                    # Do a BFS that avoids u to get all components attached to the neighbors of u.
                    visited = [False] * N
                    visited[u] = True
                    comps = []   # list of sets (each set is a component)
                    for v in graph[u]:
                        if not visited[v]:
                            comp_set = set()
                            queue = deque([v])
                            visited[v] = True
                            comp_set.add(v)
                            while queue:
                                node = queue.popleft()
                                for neighbor in graph[node]:
                                    if not visited[neighbor] and neighbor != u:

                                        comp_set.add(neighbor)
                                        queue.append(neighbor)
                            comps.append(comp_set)

                    # Now, we have len(comps) = ? (should be k, because each neighbor is in one component and we have k neighbors) 
                    # But note: it is possible that the graph is disconnected? But the original tree is connected. When we remove u, we get exactly k components? 
                    if len(comps) != k:
                        # This should not happen? but skip.

        We'll hope it passes.

        Let me test on the sample node3 (node4) in the sample:

            u = 3 (0-indexed for node4)
            k = 3, s=4.

            Then we do BFS that avoids u=3:

                Start with the first neighbor: v0 in graph[3]: 
                    graph[3]: [2, 6, 11]   (if we built the graph: 
                        node3 (index3) is connected to: 
                            in the sample: 
                                node4 (index3) is connected to node2 (index1), node7 (index6), and node12 (index11) -> so neighbors: 1,6,11.

                Then we do:
                    Start with v0=1: 
                        BFS: 
                            1: then neighbors: [3] (but 3 is u, skip), [7] (index6? but 6 is connected to 3? skip), [10] (index11? but 11 is connected to 3? skip) -> 
                        Actually, the neighbors of node1 (index1) in the global graph: 
                            graph[1]: [0]? -> no, wait we have:

                We have the graph for 13 nodes (0-indexed) as:

                  0: [4, 6]   // node1 (index0) connected to node5(4) and node7(6)
                  1: [3, 7, 10]   // node2 (index1) connected to node4(3), node8(7), node11(10)
                  2: [11]   // node3 connected to node12(11)
                  3: [1, 6, 11]   // node4 connected to node2(1), node7(6), node12(11)
                  4: [0]   // node5
                  5: [10]   // node6 connected to node11(10)
                  6: [0,3,12]   // node7 connected to node1(0), node4(3), node13(12)
                  7: [1]   // node8
                  8: [9,11]   // node9 connected to node10(9), node12(11)
                  9: [8]   // node10
                  10: [1,5]   // node11 connected to node2(1), node6(5)
                  11: [2,3,8]   // node12 connected to node3(2), node4(3), node9(8)
                  12: [6]   // node13

                For u=3 (index3), we start with v0=1 (index1):

                    BFS: 
                        1: 
                            neighbors: 
                                3 (skip), 
                                7 (index7): not visited -> add, 
                                10 (index10): not visited -> add.
                        Then 7: 
                            neighbors: 1 (visited) -> nothing.
                        Then 10: 
                            neighbors: 1 (visited), 5 (index5) -> add.
                        Then 5: 
                            neighbors: 10 (visited) -> done.
                    Then comp0: {1,7,10,5} -> size=4 -> good.

                Then next neighbor: v1=6 (index6) in graph[3]? 
                    Start from 6: 
                        6: 
                            neighbors: 0 (index0), 3 (skip), 12 (index12) -> 
                                0: add
                                12: add
                        0: 
                            neighbors: 6 (visited), 4 (index4) -> add.
                        12: 
                            neighbors: 6 (visited), 2 (index2), 8 (index8) -> 
                                2: add, 
                                8: add.
                        4: 
                            neighbors: 0 (visited) -> done.
                        2: 
                            neighbors: 12 (visited), 11 (index11) -> add? 
                        8: 
                            neighbors: 12 (visited), 9 (index9) -> add.
                        11: 
                            neighbors: 2 (visited) -> done.
                        9: 
                            neighbors: 8 (visited) -> done.
                    Then comp1: {6,0,12,4,2,8,11,9} -> size=8 -> not 4.

            What's the issue? 

            The component attached to neighbor 6 (node7) should be: 
                {1,7,13}? -> no, in the sample: 
                The sample: 
                    A: {5,1,7,13} -> nodes: 4,0,6,12 -> size=4.
                    B: {8,2,11,6} -> nodes: 7,1,10,5 -> size=4.
                    C: {3,12,9,10} -> nodes: 2,11,8,9 -> size=4.

            Why did we get a component of size 8? 

            The issue: the graph is not directed. The component attached to neighbor 6 should be the set of nodes that are connected to 6 without going through u=3. 
                From 6: 
                    can go to 0 and 12? 
                    from 0: can go to 4? 
                    from 12: can go to 2 and 8? 
                    from 2: can go to 11? 
                    from 8: can go to 9? 
                But 11 is connected to 1? and 1 is in the first component? 

            Why is 11 in this component? 

            In the global graph, 11 (index10) is connected to 1 (index1) and 5 (index5). But 1 is in the first component? 
            In the BFS for the first component we visited 1,7,10,5. So 10 is index10? 
            Then 11 is index11? 

            The sample node11 is index10? 
            The sample node12 is index11? 

            Let me map:

                node1:0, node2:1, node3:2, node4:3, node5:4, node6:5, node7:6, node8:7, node9:8, node10:9, node11:10, node12:11, node13:12.

            The sample component B: {8,2,11,6} -> 
                node8: index7, node2: index1, node11: index10, node6: index5.

            In our BFS for the first component (starting at node2, index1) we got: 
                index1, then index7 (node8), index10 (node11), index5 (node6). 
            But then the next component starts at node7 (index6) -> then we get: 
                index6, index0 (node1), index12 (node13), then index0's neighbor: index4 (node5) -> and index12's neighbors: index2 (node3), index8 (node9) -> then index2's neighbor: index11 (node12) -> and index8's neighbor: index9 (node10).

            But node12 (index11) is not the same as node11 (index10). 

            The sample component C: {3,12,9,10} -> 
                node3: index2, node12: index11, node9: index8, node10: index9.

            So we see that in the BFS for the second component, we included node0 (node1) and node4 (node5) which should be in component A? 

            The sample component A: {5,1,7,13} -> 
                node5: index4, node1: index0, node7: index6, node13: index12.

            But we started the first component at node2 (index1) and we got {1,7,10,5} -> 
                index1 (node2), index7 (node8), index10 (node11), index5 (node6) -> that is component B.

            Then we start the next at node7 (index6) -> which is node7? that is in the sample component A? 
            Then we should get: 
                node7 (index6): 
                    neighbors: 
                        0 (node1, index0), 
                        3 (node4, index3) [skip], 
                        12 (node13, index12) -> 
                    Then add 0 and 12.
                Then from 0: 
                    neighbors: 4 (node5, index4) -> add.
                Then from 12: 
                    neighbors: 2 (node3, index2) [should we add?] -> but node3 is in component C? 
                Actually, from node13 (index12): 
                    in the global graph: 
                        node13 (index12) is connected to node7 (index6) and that's it? 
                So we only get: [6,0,12,4] -> size=4.

            Then the next neighbor: v2=11 (index11) -> 
                Start from 11: 
                    11: 
                        neighbors: 2 (node3, index2), 3 (skip), 8 (node9, index8) -> 
                        add 2 and 8.
                Then 2: 
                    neighbors: 11 (visited), 11 (node12? no) -> 
                    Actually, node3 (index2) is connected to node12 (index11) -> already in the set? 
                    And also connected to node4 (index3) [skip] and node12 (index11) [in the set?] -> 
                    Then from 2: we go to no new node? 
                Then 8: 
                    neighbors: 11 (visited), 9 (node10, index9) -> add 9.
                Then 9: 
                    neighbors: 8 (visited) -> done.
                Then comp2: {11,2,8,9} -> size=4.

            Then we have three components of size 4.

            So we then compute the canonical hash for each.

            We hope they are the same.

            We'll compute the center and the hash for each component.

            Component0: [6,0,12,4] -> 
                Nodes: 0,4,6,12.
                Edges: 
                    0-4, 0-6, 6-12.
                This is a chain: 4-0-6-12.

                Centers: 
                    The diameter is 3, so centers: the middle node? 
                    We remove leaves: 
                        leaves: 4,12 -> then remove them, then leaves: 0,6 -> then remove them? 
                    Then centers: the last two? 
                    Actually, the centers of a chain of 4: the two middle nodes? 
                    Then centers: 0 and 6? 

                Then we compute the hash for the tree rooted at 0 and at 6? 
                    Rooted at 0: 
                        0: children: 4 and 6? 
                        4: leaf -> hash (1,1)
                        6: has child 12 -> leaf -> then hash for 6: (1 * base + 1) % mod1, ... 
                    Then we sort the children of 0: 
                        [ (1,1) for 4, (h6, h6) for 6] 
                    Then we combine: 
                        h0 = (1 * base + h6) * base + 1? 
                    But we sort: the two children: we sort by the hash? 
                        The hash for 4: (1,1)
                        The hash for 6: ( (1 * base + 1) % mod1, ...) 
                        Since base is 131, then (1,1) < (132, ...) -> so we put 4 first, then 6.

                Rooted at 6: 
                    6: children: 0 and 12? 
                    0: has child 4? 
                    Then we need to compute for 0: 
                        0: children: [4] -> hash0 = (1 * base + 1) % mod? 
                    12: leaf -> (1,1)
                    Then for 6: 
                        children: [0,12] -> sort: ( (h0, h0) and (1,1) ) -> since 1 < h0? 
                        so we put 12 first, then 0.
                    Then h6 = (1 * base + h0) ... 

                Then the two hashes are different? 

            How to fix? 

            The unrooted trees are the same? But they are both chains of 4 nodes? and are identical? 

            But note: the chain of 4 nodes is symmetric. The two centers are the two middle nodes. Then the two rooted trees at the centers are the same: 
                For center0: 
                    It is a center: the tree has two branches: one of length 1 (to 4) and one of length 1 (to 6, and then to 12? no, the center should be the middle? 

            Actually, the center of a chain of 4 nodes is the two middle nodes. Then we break the edge between the two centers? 

            But we are rooting the entire tree at the center? 

            For center0 (node0): 
                The tree: 
                    node0 is connected to node4 and node6? 
                    Then the branch to node4: a leaf.
                    Then the branch to node6: which is connected to node12 (a leaf) -> but then the tree rooted at 0 has two children: 4 and 6, and 6 has a child 12.

            For center1 (node6): 
                The tree: 
                    node6 is connected to node0 and node12.
                    node0 is connected to node4 (a leaf) -> so the branch: 0 has a child 4? 
                    Then the tree: 
                        6: 
                            child0: 12 (leaf)
                            child1: 0 -> which has a child4 (leaf)

                Then the structure is different? 

            How do we represent the tree? 

            We are building the entire tree for the component: 
                For component0: 
                    The edges: 
                        0-4, 0-6, 6-12.
                    This forms a chain: 4-0-6-12.

            When we root at 0: 
                0
                / \
               4   6
                   \
                    12

            When we root at 6: 
                6
                /  \
               0    12
              /
             4

            These are different? 

            But the unrooted tree is the same. 

            However, the problem: the trees must be identical (isomorphic as unrooted trees). 

            How to compare? 

            We are taking the minimum of the hashes when rooted at the two centers? 
                For the chain of 4, the two centers are 0 and 6. 
                Then we compute the hash for the tree rooted at 0: 
                    Let base=131, mod1=10**9+7, mod2=10**9+9.

                    Leaf 4: (1,1)
                    Leaf 12: (1,1)
                    Node6: 
                        children = [12] -> sorted: [ (1,1) ] -> 
                        h1_6 = (1 * base + 1) % mod1 = 132
                        h2_6 = (1 * base + 1) % mod2 = 132
                    Node0: 
                        children = [4,6] -> sort: (1,1) and (132,132) -> then (1,1) then (132,132)
                        h1_0 = (1 * base + 1) * base + 132 = (131+1)*131+132 = 132*131+132 = 132*132 = 17424
                For the tree rooted at 6: 
                    Node4: (1,1)
                    Node0: 
                        children = [4] -> 
                        h1_0 = (1 * base + 1) = 132
                    Node6: 
                        children = [0,12] -> sort: (1,1) and (132,132) -> then (1,1) then (132,132)
                        h1_6 = (1 * base + 1) * base + 132 = 132*131+132 = 17424

                Then the minimum of (17424, 17424) is 17424.

            For the other components (which are also chains of 4) we will get the same hash.

            Therefore, they are the same.

        We'll hope it works.

        We'll code accordingly.

        Note: The hash might be the same for isomorphic trees and different for non-isomorphic trees.

        We'll submit and hope.

        Time: The worst-case total work: 
            The number of candidate u: the number of nodes with deg[u] a divisor of (N-1) and deg[u]>=2. 
            Then for each candidate u, we do: 
                One BFS to partition the graph without u: O(N)
                Then for each component (k components), we do: 
                    Find centers: O(s) (the size of the component)
                    Build a BFS tree: O(s)
                    Compute the hash: O(s)

                The total for the components: O(k * s) = O(N-1) = O(N)

            Then per candidate u: O(N). 
            The number of candidate u: at most the number of divisors of (N-1) times the frequency of that degree? 
                The divisors: about 48, and the frequency: the sum of degrees is 2*(N-1), so the average degree is about 2, and the number of nodes with a specific degree d: we can precompute the frequency. 
                The worst-case: a star tree: one node has degree N-1, then if (N-1) is a divisor of (N-1) (which it is) and if N-1 is at least 2, then we consider that node. 
                Then the work for that node: O(N) for the BFS and then O(N) for the components? -> total O(N) per candidate u, and only one candidate u? 
                Then O(N) = 4000.

            The worst-case total work: the number of candidate u is bounded by the number of divisors (about 48) times the maximum frequency of a degree? 
                The maximum frequency: in a tree, the degrees are between 1 and N-1. The frequency: most nodes are leaves. 
                The number of nodes with a specific degree d: we can have at most O(N) nodes. 
                But the divisors are about 48, then total candidate u: 48 * (number of nodes with that degree) -> worst-case 48 * (number of nodes with a particular degree) and the number of nodes with a particular degree: the star has one node with degree N-1 and the rest degree 1. 
                Then the total candidate u: 48 * 1 = 48. 
                Then total work: 48 * 4000 = 192000.

            This is acceptable.

        We'll code accordingly.

        Let me write the code accordingly.

        But note: the problem says memory 256MB, so we can store the graph.

        We'll hope it passes.

        Note: It is possible that the same hash appears for different trees? We use double hashing to reduce the chance.

        We'll run on the provided examples.

        Example1: 
            Input: 13 nodes as described -> should output 3.

        Example2: 
            Input: 6 nodes (star) -> output -1.

        We'll hope.

        However, the sample input2: 
            "6
             1 2
             1 3
             2 4
             3 5
             3 6"

            We did above: it outputs -1.

        We'll run the sample input1.

        The node4 (index3) should be the good cutting point.

        We have to hope that the three components (which are chains of 4) all have the same canonical hash.

        They should.

        Therefore, we output 3.

        We'll submit.

        Note: The worst-case N=4000, the number of candidate u is at most about 48, and the work per candidate u is about 4000, so total work 48*4000 = 192000, which is acceptable in Pyton? 

        But note: the BFS for the entire graph without u: that is 4000 nodes. And then for each component, we do BFS for the center and for the tree building: the total over components is 4000. So per candidate u: 8000? 

        Then 48 * 8000 = 384000, which is acceptable.

        Let me hope.

        We'll write the code accordingly.

        However, note: the leaf removal for center: we did a while loop that goes over the entire component. And then the BFS for the tree building: also over the entire component. 

        The total work per candidate u: 
            The first BFS: O(N)
            Then for each component: 
                leaf removal: O(s) for the component.
                BFS for tree building: O(s) for the component.
                Then the hash computation: O(s) for the component.
            And the sum of s over the components is N-1.

        So per candidate u: O(N) + O(N) = O(N).

        Therefore, total work: O(N * (#candidate u)) = O(4000 * 48) = 192000.

        We'll code accordingly.

        Let me code accordingly.

        But note: the leaf removal: we did a while loop that goes over the entire component? 
            We start with leaves, and we remove them layer by layer. 
            The total work is the number of edges in the component? which is s-1? 

        Similarly, the BFS for tree building: also s-1 edges.

        So it is O(s) per component.

        We are good.

        We'll output the code.

        However, the problem says: output the editorial, not the code.

        But we have provided the editorial with the algorithm.

        We'll stop here.
