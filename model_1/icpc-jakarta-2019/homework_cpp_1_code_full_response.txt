To solve this problem, we need to generate a permutation \( B \) of integers from 1 to \( N \) such that the sum of absolute differences between each element of the given permutation \( A \) and the corresponding element in \( B \) is at least \( N \). The solution leverages the properties of permutations and cyclic shifts to efficiently construct such a permutation \( B \).

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires finding any permutation \( B \) of the integers from 1 to \( N \) such that the sum of absolute differences \( \sum_{i=1}^{N} |A_i - B_i| \) is at least \( N \). Given the constraints \( 2 \leq N \leq 100,000 \), the solution must be efficient.
2. **Key Insight**: For even \( N \), reversing the permutation \( A \) ensures that the sum of absolute differences is at least \( N \). For odd \( N \), a cyclic shift of \( A \) (where each element moves one position left, and the first element moves to the end) guarantees the sum is at least \( N \).
3. **Algorithm Selection**: 
   - **Even \( N \)**: Reversing \( A \) produces \( B \). The sum of absolute differences for this \( B \) is at least \( N \) because each pair of elements in the reversed permutation contributes a minimum difference, ensuring the total meets the requirement.
   - **Odd \( N \)**: A cyclic shift left of \( A \) (i.e., \( B_i = A_{i+1} \) for \( 0 \leq i < N-1 \) and \( B_{N-1} = A_0 \)) ensures the sum of absolute differences is at least \( 2 \times (N-1) \), which is greater than or equal to \( N \) for \( N \geq 2 \).

### Solution Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> A(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> A[i];
    }

    if (n % 2 == 0) {
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            cout << A[i];
            if (i > 0) {
                cout << " ";
            }
        }
    } else {
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            cout << A[i] << " ";
        }
        cout << A[0];
    }
    cout << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the integer \( N \) and the permutation \( A \) of size \( N \).
2. **Handling Even \( N \)**: If \( N \) is even, the code outputs the reverse of \( A \). This reversal ensures that the sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements of \( A \) and \( B \) is at least \( N \).
3. **Handling Odd \( N \)**: If \( N \) is odd, the code performs a cyclic shift left on \( A \). The first element of \( A \) is moved to the end, and each subsequent element is shifted one position left. This configuration guarantees that the sum of absolute differences meets the required condition.
4. **Output**: The resulting permutation \( B \) is printed with elements separated by spaces. The solution efficiently handles the constraints with \( O(N) \) time complexity for both reading input and generating the output, and \( O(N) \) space complexity for storing the permutation. 

This approach ensures that the generated permutation \( B \) meets the problem's requirements efficiently and correctly for all valid inputs.
