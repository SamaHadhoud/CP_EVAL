We are given:
  N, K, G1, G2, G3: integers
  a string s of length N representing the yard.

Constraints:
  - N up to 100,000 but at most 50 rocks.

Important: We have three tile types:
  Type-1: 1x1 on '.' -> ghost power G1
  Type-2: 1x2 on ".." -> ghost power G2
  Type-3: 1x3 on ".#." -> ghost power G3

Rules:
  - Tiles cannot overlap.
  - At most K Type-1 tiles.

Note: We do not have to cover all cells. We can leave some untiled.

Objective: Maximize the total ghost repelling power.

Observations:
  - The yard has rocks which are obstacles and cannot be tiled. They break the yard into contiguous soil segments? 
    But note: Type-3 tiles require a rock in the middle. So the rock is actually part of the tile. Therefore, we cannot simply break the yard by rocks.

Alternative idea: Since there are at most 50 rocks, we can consider the gaps between rocks? However, the Type-3 tile uses a rock. So we have to consider the entire yard and the positions of rocks.

But note: The problem says "There are at most 50 rock cells". This small number suggests that we can use dynamic programming that iterates over the positions and also uses state that depends on the rocks? However, the entire string is long (100,000). 

But note: the rocks break the yard into segments? Actually, Type-3 tiles use a rock and two adjacent soils. So we have to consider the entire string and the rocks might be part of the tiles.

We can think of the yard as a sequence of cells. We can use DP that goes from left to right. However, the state would have to remember:
  - The current position.
  - The number of Type-1 tiles used so far (but K can be up to 100,000, so we cannot iterate over K in state?).
  - The state of the last few cells (because Type-2 and Type-3 span 2 and 3 cells).

But note: Type-3 tile uses a rock in the middle, so the rock is fixed. Actually, we can avoid covering the rocks? However, the Type-3 tile covers the rock. But the rock is an obstacle for other tiles? Actually, we can only put a Type-3 tile on a pattern that has a rock in the middle. And the rock is not covered by any other tile.

So the rocks are fixed and cannot be moved. We must avoid tiling on rocks except that Type-3 tiles use the rock as the middle. But note: the rock is covered by the Type-3 tile. However, the problem states that Type-3 is placed on ".#.", meaning the rock is part of the tile. This is allowed because the rock is in the middle and the tile is designed for it.

But note: a rock cell cannot be covered by any other tile. So if we use a Type-3 tile, then the rock is covered by that tile and we don't have to worry about it. However, if we don't use a Type-3 tile on a rock, then we cannot cover the rock at all.

But wait: the problem says "each cell is covered by at most one tile". So we can leave the rock untiled? Actually, we can. However, the Type-3 tile requires the rock to be present. So if we leave the rock untiled, that's acceptable.

Therefore, we can view the rocks as obstacles that break the yard into segments? But note: Type-3 tiles bridge over a rock. For example, the tile covers the rock and the two adjacent soils. So the segments are not independent? 

However, note that a Type-3 tile uses a rock and the two adjacent soils. This tile then effectively connects two segments? Actually, it uses one cell from the segment to the left and one from the segment to the right. So the segments are not independent.

Alternative approach:

Since there are at most 50 rocks, we can consider the entire yard as a sequence of segments of consecutive soils that are separated by rocks. But then we have to account for the Type-3 tiles that use a rock and one soil from the left segment and one soil from the right segment.

We can break the yard into segments of soils that are separated by rocks. However, the Type-3 tile will use one rock and two adjacent soils that are in different segments? Actually, the two soils might be in the same segment if the rock is isolated? But note: the rock is in the middle and the two soils are adjacent to the rock. So the soils are from the segments that are immediately next to the rock.

Let the rocks be at positions r1, r2, ..., rm (m<=50). Then the yard is:

  [0, r1-1] : segment0 (soil only)
  then rock at r1
  [r1+1, r2-1]: segment1
  then rock at r2
  ... 
  then last segment.

But note: Type-3 tiles can be placed on a rock and the two adjacent soils. For the rock at position r, the two adjacent soils are at r-1 and r+1 (if they exist and are soil). However, if the rock is at the boundary, then we cannot use it for a Type-3 tile.

Moreover, a Type-3 tile uses the rock and the two adjacent soils. Therefore, if we use a Type-3 tile on a rock, then we are effectively removing the rock and the two adjacent soils from consideration? Actually, we cover the rock and the two adjacent soils. Then the segments become:

  For the rock at r, the soil at r-1 is the last soil of the segment to the left, and the soil at r+1 is the first soil of the segment to the right. Using a Type-3 tile on this rock would then remove the last soil of the left segment and the first soil of the right segment.

But note: we are allowed to leave cells untiled. So we have to decide for each rock whether to use it in a Type-3 tile or not. And if we use it, then we remove two adjacent soils (if available) and the rock.

This problem becomes a complex DP over the rocks and the segments. However, we have at most 50 rocks. So we can do DP over the rocks and the state for the segments? But note: the segments can be long (up to 100,000 in total) but we can precompute something for each segment.

How about we precompute for a segment of consecutive soils of length L the maximum number of Type-2 tiles we can use? But note: we are also allowed to use Type-1 tiles and we have a constraint on the total number of Type-1 tiles. However, Type-3 tiles are not used inside a segment (because they require a rock in the middle) so they are only used at the boundaries with rocks.

Therefore, we can consider:

  - The entire yard without rocks? But rocks are present and Type-3 tiles use rocks.

Plan:

Step 1: Identify the positions of rocks. Let R = list of rock indices.

Step 2: Break the yard into segments of consecutive soils. But note: the rocks are fixed and Type-3 tiles use rocks and their immediate neighbors.

We can define:

  segments[0]: from 0 to R[0]-1   (if R[0] > 0)
  segments[i] for i from 1 to len(R)-1: from R[i-1]+1 to R[i]-1
  segments[last]: from R[-1]+1 to N-1

But note: the soil cells adjacent to rocks (if not used for Type-3) are part of these segments.

However, if we use a Type-3 tile on a rock, we remove the rock and the two adjacent soils. This removal will affect the segments: we remove one cell from the left segment (if it exists) and one cell from the right segment (if it exists). 

So we have two types of resources:

  Type-A: The segments of soil that are not adjacent to any rock? Actually, every segment is adjacent to rocks? Actually, the segments are separated by rocks.

But note: the entire yard might start and end with soil. So the first and last segments are not adjacent to rocks on both sides.

We can model the entire yard as:

  segments: [s0, s1, s2, ..., sm] for m+1 segments (if there are m rocks)

  and the rocks are between these segments.

We then have the possibility to use a Type-3 tile on a rock that lies between two segments. This tile would use one soil from the end of the left segment and one soil from the beginning of the right segment.

Therefore, we can define:

  Let A_i = the length of the i-th segment.

But then if we use a Type-3 tile on the rock between segment i and segment i+1, we reduce the length of segment i by 1 (if segment i is non-empty) and reduce the length of segment i+1 by 1 (if segment i+1 is non-empty). However, note: we might not have a segment on one side? For example, if the rock is at the beginning, then there is no left segment.

So we have to consider the possibility for each rock to be used as a Type-3 tile or not. And the effect is:

  - For rock j between segment i and segment i+1 (if both segments exist and are non-empty) we can use a Type-3 tile and then we lose one soil from the end of segment i and one from the beginning of segment i+1.

But note: we cannot use a Type-3 tile if one of the adjacent cells is missing (either because the segment is empty or because we are at the boundary). So for each rock we can only use it if:

  - It is not at the boundary: then we require the left neighbor (index r-1) to be soil and the right neighbor (index r+1) to be soil.

But note: the problem states that the Type-3 tile is placed on ".#." meaning the rock in the middle and two soils. So the adjacent cells must be soil. However, if the rock is at the beginning, then we cannot use a Type-3 tile because the left neighbor doesn't exist. Similarly for the end.

Therefore, we can precompute for each rock whether it is eligible for a Type-3 tile.

Now, the problem becomes:

  We have m rocks. For each rock, we have a boolean: eligible or not.

  We have m+1 segments, each segment i has a length A_i.

  Additionally, if we use a Type-3 tile on a rock that is eligible, then we reduce the soil count of the adjacent segments by 1 (if the segment is non-empty). But note: we can use multiple Type-3 tiles? But the rocks are separated. However, if two rocks are adjacent? 

Example: ".#.#." -> rocks at positions 1 and 3. 

  We cannot use a Type-3 tile on the first rock (at index1) because after using it we cover:
      index0,1,2: becomes tiled. Then the soil at index2 is gone. Then for the rock at index3: the left neighbor is index2 which is now tiled (so not available) and the right neighbor is index4. But we cannot use the rock at index3 because the left neighbor is now covered.

Therefore, we cannot use two adjacent Type-3 tiles? Actually, we can use two non-overlapping Type-3 tiles if there is at least one soil between the rocks? 

But note: the tiles cannot overlap. The Type-3 tile at rock1 uses cells [0,1,2]. The Type-3 tile at rock3 uses cells [2,3,4]. But then cell2 is covered twice? -> This is not allowed.

So we cannot use two Type-3 tiles that are adjacent (with no soil in between) because they would require the same soil (the one in the middle) to be covered twice.

But if there are two rocks separated by at least two soils? Then we can use both. For example: ".. # ..." -> rocks at index2 and index5. Then we can use Type-3 for the rock at index2: covering indices1,2,3 -> then the segment between the rocks becomes ... -> becomes a segment of length 1 (from index4 to index4) and then we can use the rock at index5? But for the rock at index5, we need index4 and index6. But index4 is now the last soil of the segment between the rocks? After removing index3 (because of the first Type-3), the segment between the rocks is from index4 to index4 (length=1). Then we can use the Type-3 tile on rock5: we need to use index4 and index6. But we can do that? Then we cover index4,5,6. This is non-overlapping.

Therefore, we can use multiple Type-3 tiles as long as they are not adjacent (meaning the rocks are separated by at least one soil). However, note that after using a Type-3 tile on a rock, we remove one soil from the right end of the left segment and one soil from the left end of the right segment. Then the segment between two rocks that are adjacent (with no soil in between) would be of length 0. Then we cannot use the second rock? Actually, adjacent rocks (with no soil in between) are not eligible for Type-3 because the rock in the middle would require the adjacent rocks as neighbors? But the pattern would be "###" in the middle? Actually, the pattern for two adjacent rocks would be ".#.#", so for the first rock we have:
   left: soil at index0, rock at index1, soil at index2? -> but then the next rock is at index3: then we have soil at index2 and index4. Then we can use both? But then the tile for the first rock uses indices0,1,2 and the tile for the second rock uses indices2,3,4 -> conflict at index2.

Therefore, we cannot use two Type-3 tiles on two rocks that are adjacent (with exactly one soil in between). The pattern would be: 
   [i-1]: soil, [i]: rock, [i+1]: soil (for the first tile) -> then [i+1] is the soil that is used by the first tile. Then the next rock at i+2: then the left neighbor would be i+1 (already covered) and the right neighbor i+3. But we cannot use the soil at i+1 again.

So if two rocks are adjacent (with no soil in between) then we cannot use both? Actually, two rocks are adjacent if there is no soil between them? That would be "##", then we cannot use either because the Type-3 tile requires a soil on both sides.

Therefore, the eligibility for a Type-3 tile is independent? Actually, no: because using a Type-3 tile on a rock might remove a soil that is adjacent to a neighboring rock, making that rock ineligible.

Thus, we need to decide which rocks to use for Type-3 tiles. Since there are at most 50 rocks, we can do DP over the rocks.

But note: the segments are long. However, the effect of a Type-3 tile is only to remove one soil from the left segment and one soil from the right segment. Then the problem for a segment is: given the original length and possibly some removals from the left and/or right, what is the maximum ghost power we can get from that segment?

However, the removals are only at the boundaries. And note: we are free to use Type-1 and Type-2 tiles arbitrarily in the segment (with the constraint on total Type-1 tiles).

But note: the entire problem has a global constraint on Type-1 tiles: at most K. And we have multiple segments. So we have to distribute the Type-1 tiles among segments.

But also: Type-3 tiles are fixed per rock and they give G3 per tile.

So the total ghost power = 
   (sum over segments of ghost power from that segment) 
   + (# of Type-3 tiles) * G3.

However, the segments are independent if we fix which rocks are used for Type-3 tiles? But the removals at the boundaries (for Type-3 tiles) change the segment lengths. 

Specifically, for segment i:

  Original length = A_i.

  If the rock to the left is used for Type-3, then we remove one soil from the right end of the left segment? Actually, for segment i, it is adjacent to two rocks: one on the left and one on the right? 

Actually, the segments are separated by rocks. So:

  Segment0: adjacent to rock0 on the right (if any) -> so if we use rock0 (the first rock) then we remove the last soil of segment0? But note: the Type-3 tile for rock0 uses the soil immediately to the left of the rock (which is the last soil of segment0) and the soil immediately to the right (which is the first soil of segment1).

Similarly, segment i (for i>=1 and i < m) is adjacent to two rocks: the rock at the left (which is rock i-1) and the rock at the right (rock i). Then:

  - If we use rock i-1, then we remove one soil from the right end of segment i? Actually, no: rock i-1 is to the left of segment i. Then using rock i-1 would remove the last soil of segment i-1 and the first soil of segment i. So segment i loses its first soil.

  - Similarly, if we use rock i, then we remove the last soil of segment i and the first soil of segment i+1.

Therefore, for segment i, we have:

  The actual available length = A_i - (if the rock to the left is used then we lose the first soil) - (if the rock to the right is used then we lose the last soil).

But note: if we lose the first soil, then the segment becomes shorter at the beginning. Similarly, the last soil.

However, what if the segment has only one soil and we lose both? Then the segment becomes negative? We must avoid that. Actually, if the segment has length 1 and we lose both, then we would get -1. That is impossible. Therefore, we can only use the rock to the left if the segment has at least one soil? Similarly for the rock to the right.

But note: we only use a rock if both adjacent cells are soil. So if the segment has length 0, we cannot use the rock to the left or right? Actually, the eligibility of a rock requires the adjacent cells to be soil. So if the segment has length 0, then the adjacent cell (which would be the soil) does not exist. Therefore, we only use a rock if the adjacent segment has at least one soil.

Therefore, for segment i:

  Let L_i = A_i - (if the rock to the left exists and we decide to use it then subtract 1) - (if the rock to the right exists and we decide to use it then subtract 1).

But note: if the rock to the left is used, then we remove the first soil of segment i. Similarly, the rock to the right: the last soil.

However, we must check: the rock to the left of segment i is the rock that separates segment i-1 and segment i. Using that rock removes the last soil of segment i-1 and the first soil of segment i. So for segment i, we lose the first soil if the rock to the left is used.

Similarly, the rock to the right of segment i (if any) is the rock separating segment i and segment i+1. Using that rock removes the last soil of segment i and the first soil of segment i+1.

Therefore, for segment i, the available soil length is:

   actual_len_i = A_i - (x_{i-1}? But wait: the rock to the left of segment i is at index i-1 in the rock list? Actually, we have:

   segment0: rocks on the right: rock0 (if present) -> so segment0 is adjacent to rock0 on the right? Then the loss for segment0: 
        if we use rock0, then we remove the last soil of segment0? Actually, the Type-3 tile on rock0 uses the soil immediately to the left of rock0 (which is the last soil of segment0) and the soil immediately to the right (first soil of segment1). So segment0 loses the last soil.

   But segment0 is not adjacent to any rock on the left? So we don't lose the first soil from the left.

   Similarly, the last segment is only adjacent to the last rock on the left? Then we lose the first soil if the last rock is used? Actually, no: the last rock is to the left of the last segment. Then we lose the first soil of the last segment if that rock is used? But wait: the rock is at the boundary between the last segment and the one before? Actually, the last segment is after the last rock. Then the rock to the left of the last segment is the last rock. So we only lose the first soil of the last segment if the last rock is used.

Therefore, we can define:

   For segment i (0-indexed from 0 to m, where m is the number of rocks) we have:

     actual_len_i = A_i - (if i>0 and we use the rock that is at the left boundary of the segment, i.e., the rock that is immediately to the left of the segment, then subtract 1) 
                   - (if i < m and we use the rock that is at the right boundary of the segment, i.e., the rock that is immediately to the right of the segment, then subtract 1)

But note: the rock at the left boundary of segment i is the rock that separates segment i-1 and segment i. So if we use that rock, we remove the last soil of segment i-1 and the first soil of segment i. Similarly, the rock at the right boundary of segment i is the rock that separates segment i and segment i+1, and using it removes the last soil of segment i and the first soil of segment i+1.

Therefore, the loss for segment i is:

   left_loss = 1 if (i>0 and we use rock i-1) else 0
   right_loss = 1 if (i<m and we use rock i) else 0

   actual_len_i = A_i - left_loss - right_loss.

But note: if the segment has length 0, then we cannot use the adjacent rocks? Actually, the eligibility of the adjacent rocks depends on the presence of the adjacent soils. But if the segment has length 0, then the adjacent soils are not present. So we would not be able to use the adjacent rocks? Therefore, our DP for the rocks should not choose a rock if the adjacent segment is empty? Or we can enforce: if we choose a rock, then the adjacent segments must have at least one soil? 

But note: the eligibility condition is already checked: we can only use a rock if the two adjacent cells are soil. Therefore, if the segment is empty, then the adjacent cell (which would be part of the segment) is missing. So we cannot use the rock.

Therefore, we can design:

  Let m = number of rocks.

  Let X be a binary vector of length m: X[j] = 1 if we use rock j for Type-3, 0 otherwise.

  Condition: for rock j, we require that the left neighbor (if exists) is soil and the right neighbor (if exists) is soil. But note: the left neighbor is the last soil of segment j? Actually, rock j is between segment j and segment j+1. The left neighbor is the last soil of segment j? And the right neighbor is the first soil of segment j+1. So we require that segment j is non-empty (so A_j>=1) and segment j+1 is non-empty (so A_{j+1}>=1). 

  However, what if the rock is at the beginning? Then there is no segment j (because the rock is the first element). Actually, we defined:

      segment0: from 0 to R[0]-1. Then rock0 is at R[0]. Then the left neighbor of rock0 is at R[0]-1 (if exists) which is the last soil of segment0. The right neighbor is R[0]+1, which is the first soil of segment1.

  Similarly, for the last rock: the right neighbor must be present -> segment m (the last segment) must be non-empty.

  Therefore, we have constraints: we can set X[j]=1 only if:

        (j==0 or the segment0 exists and has at least one soil? Actually, the segment0 exists if R[0]>0? Actually, the segment0 is from 0 to R[0]-1. So if R[0]>=1 then segment0 has at least one cell? But if R[0]==0 then there is no segment0? Then the left neighbor of the first rock is at index -1 -> invalid. So we require:

        - For rock j, the segment j (the segment to the left) must exist and have at least one soil? Actually, the segment j exists if the rock j is not at the beginning. Similarly, the segment j+1 exists if the rock j is not at the end.

        Specifically, we require:
          - The left neighbor must exist: meaning the rock j is not at the beginning and the segment j is non-empty? Actually, the segment j is defined from the previous rock (or start) to the current rock. The last cell of segment j is at rock_j - 1. So if rock_j > 0 and the cell at rock_j-1 is '.' (which it is, because we defined the segment as contiguous soil) then the left neighbor exists.

          - The right neighbor must exist: meaning the rock j is not at the end (rock_j < N-1) and the next cell is '.' (which it is, because the segment j+1 starts at rock_j+1).

        But note: the segments are defined by the rocks. The segment j is the segment to the left of rock j. The segment j+1 is the segment to the right of rock j. So:

          Segment j: from (previous_rock+1) to (rock_j-1). The length A_j = (rock_j - prev_rock - 1). But if there is no previous rock, then from 0 to rock_j-1.

          So the condition for rock j to be eligible is:

             (rock_j > 0) and (the cell at rock_j-1 is '.') and (rock_j < N-1) and (the cell at rock_j+1 is '.').

        However, we know the cell at rock_j is '#' and the adjacent cells are '.' if they are in the segments? Actually, the segments are contiguous soils. So the adjacent cells are '.'.

        Therefore, we can precompute for each rock j:

            eligible[j] = True if (rock_j > 0) and (rock_j < N-1) and (s[rock_j-1]=='.' and s[rock_j+1]=='.') 

        But note: what if the adjacent cell is actually a rock? Then we wouldn't have a segment? Actually, if the adjacent cell is a rock, then the segment length would be 0? For example, if we have two adjacent rocks, then the segment between them has length 0. Then the adjacent cells of the first rock are: left (if exists) and the next cell is the second rock? So the right neighbor is not soil -> not eligible.

        So we can precompute eligibility for each rock.

Step 3: Then the problem becomes:

  We have m rocks. We choose a subset S of rocks (with the condition that for each rock in S, it is eligible and we can only choose non-adjacent rocks? Actually, we saw that if two rocks are adjacent (with no soil between them) we cannot use both. But note: if two rocks are separated by one or more soils, then we can use both? However, the problem of overlapping is that the Type-3 tile for the first rock removes the soil at the right boundary of the left segment and the soil at the left boundary of the next segment. Then the next segment is the segment between the two rocks. If that segment has at least two soils, then after removing the first soil (because of the first Type-3 tile) and the last soil (because of the second Type-3 tile) we can still use the middle soils? But note: the two Type-3 tiles do not overlap: the first uses the soil immediately to the right of the first rock (which is the first soil of the segment between the rocks) and the second uses the soil immediately to the left of the second rock (which is the last soil of the segment between the rocks). So the segment between the rocks loses the first and last soil. Then the segment in the middle has length = (original_length) - 2? 

  But wait: the segment between two rocks j and j+1 is segment j+1. And for that segment, we lose:

        left_loss: from rock j (if used) -> we lose the first soil of segment j+1.
        right_loss: from rock j+1 (if used) -> we lose the last soil of segment j+1.

  So the actual length of segment j+1 = A_{j+1} - (if rock j is used) - (if rock j+1 is used).

  Therefore, we can use multiple rocks arbitrarily? The only constraint is the eligibility: for each rock j, we require that the segment j (the one to the left) has at least one soil (so we can take the last soil) and the segment j+1 (the one to the right) has at least one soil (so we can take the first soil). And note: if we use two rocks j and j+1, then for the segment j+1 we require at least two soils? Because we remove the first and the last. Actually, we require at least one soil for the eligibility of rock j (which takes one from the segment j and one from segment j+1) and similarly for rock j+1: it requires one from segment j+1 and one from segment j+2. But the segment j+1 must have at least one soil for rock j (to take the first soil) and at least one soil for rock j+1 (to take the last soil). However, the same segment j+1 must have at least two soils? Because we remove the first and the last. 

  But the eligibility condition for rock j and rock j+1 is independent? 

  Actually, the eligibility condition for rock j is checked on the original string: the cells at rock_j-1 and rock_j+1. Similarly for rock j+1: rock_j+1-1 and rock_j+1+1. Note that rock_j+1-1 = rock_j+1 - 1. If the rocks are consecutive (rock_j+1 = rock_j+1) then the right neighbor of rock_j is at rock_j+1 -> but that is a rock? So in the original string, the eligibility for rock_j: the cell at rock_j+1 is a rock (if the next rock is adjacent) -> not soil. So rock_j is not eligible? 

  Therefore, we cannot have two consecutive rocks eligible? Only rocks that are separated by at least one soil are eligible. And if they are separated by at least one soil, then the segment between them has length>=1. Then when we use both rocks, we remove the first and last soil of that segment, so the segment must have at least 2 soils? 

  Actually, the eligibility condition for rock_j requires the cell at rock_j+1 to be soil. If the next rock is at rock_j+1, then the cell at rock_j+1 is rock, so not eligible. Therefore, we can only use non-adjacent rocks? Actually, rocks that are separated by at least one soil. And the segment between two rocks that are separated by d has length d-1 (because the segment runs from rock_j+1 to rock_j+1-1). For example, rocks at positions i and j (with j>i), the segment between them is from i+1 to j-1 -> length = j-i-1.

  And if j-i-1>=1, then rock i is eligible if the segment to the right (which is the segment between i and j) has at least one soil? Actually, the segment to the right of rock i is the segment that starts at i+1. The first soil is at i+1. Similarly, the segment to the left of rock j is the segment that ends at j-1. So both rocks are eligible? 

  Then if we use both, the segment between them (which is of length L = j-i-1) becomes:

        actual_length = L - 1 (from rock i: remove the last soil of the segment to the left? Actually, the segment to the left of rock i is not the segment between the rocks. The segment to the left of rock i is segment i, and the segment to the right of rock i is segment i+1. The segment between the rocks is segment i+1. Then:

          - Using rock i: we remove the last soil of segment i (the segment to the left of rock i) and the first soil of segment i+1 (the segment between the rocks).
          - Using rock j: we remove the last soil of segment i+1 (the segment between the rocks) and the first soil of segment i+2 (the segment to the right of rock j).

  Therefore, the segment i+1 (the one between the rocks) loses the first soil and the last soil. So the available length for segment i+1 is L - 2.

  But note: we require that segment i+1 has at least 2 soils to be able to use both rocks? 

  However, the eligibility condition for the rocks does not require the segment i+1 to have at least two soils. It only requires that the immediate neighbors are soil. For rock i: the right neighbor is at i+1 -> soil (because the segment i+1 has at least one soil). For rock j: the left neighbor is at j-1 -> soil (because the segment i+1 has at least one soil). 

  So we can use both rocks even if the segment between them has length 1? Then we remove the first and last soil of a segment of length 1 -> that would make the segment length -1? -> which is impossible.

  Therefore, we must not use a rock if the adjacent segment (which will be reduced) becomes negative? Actually, we can avoid using a rock that would make the adjacent segment length negative? But we are making the decision for the rocks first. So we should only choose a rock j if the adjacent segments have enough soil to be removed? Specifically:

        For rock j:

          - The segment j (to the left) must have at least one soil (to remove the last soil) -> but if we already removed some soils from segment j by a previous rock? Actually, we are not processing in order? 

  This becomes messy.

Alternative approach:

  Since there are at most 50 rocks, we can iterate over the entire set of rocks and use DP to decide which rocks to use. We can do:

      dp[i] = maximum total ghost power we can get from the rocks up to index i (i from 0 to m-1) and the segments that are affected by these rocks.

  But the segments are shared: segment i is affected by rock i-1 and rock i. So we need to account for the segments as we go.

  However, note: the segments are independent? Actually, the segment i is only affected by rock i-1 and rock i. So if we consider the rocks in order, we can account for the segments.

  Specifically, we traverse the rocks from left to right. The state should remember:

      - The decision for the last rock (whether we used it or not) because the next segment (which is the segment after the current rock) will be affected by the current rock.

  But note: the segment between rock i and rock i+1 is affected by rock i and rock i+1. So when we process rock i, we haven't processed rock i+1. 

  Alternatively, we can include the effect on the segment between rock i and rock i+1 in the state? 

  Let's define:

      dp[i][a] = maximum ghost power we can get from the first i rocks and the segments up to segment i (the segment to the left of rock i) and also the effect on the segment i (which is between rock i and rock i+1) is accounted for by a state a.

  But the state a might represent whether we have removed the first soil of segment i (because we used rock i-1) and whether we have removed the last soil of segment i (because we used rock i)? Actually, we haven't decided rock i yet. 

  This seems complicated.

We need a simpler idea.

Insight:

  We note that Type-3 tiles are fixed: each gives G3 and uses one rock and two adjacent soils. The remaining soils form independent segments? But the removals of the soils at the boundaries break the segments. However, after fixing which rocks are used, the remaining soils form independent segments? And then we can solve each segment independently? 

  Then the problem becomes:

      We choose a set S of rocks (subset of eligible rocks, and we cannot choose two rocks that are consecutive? Actually, we can choose non-adjacent ones arbitrarily? But we saw we can choose two rocks that are separated by at least one soil, as long as the segment between them has at least two soils? Or even one soil? 

      Actually, if we choose two rocks that are separated by one soil, then the segment between them has one soil. Then we remove the first soil (because of the left rock) and the last soil (because of the right rock) of that segment. But the segment only has one soil -> we remove it twice? -> which is impossible.

      Therefore, we cannot choose two rocks that are adjacent in the rock array? Because if they are adjacent, then the segment between them has length = (next_rock - current_rock - 1). If they are consecutive rocks (with no soil between) then the length is 0 -> we cannot use either? Actually, we already said they are not eligible. But if they are separated by one soil, then the segment between them has length 1. Then if we use both rocks, we require to remove two soils from that segment -> which only has one. 

      Therefore, we cannot choose two rocks that are consecutive in the rock array? 

      How about rocks separated by two soils? Then the segment has length 2. Then we remove the first soil (because of the left rock) and the last soil (because of the right rock) -> then the segment becomes empty. Then we can use both rocks.

      So the constraint is: we can only choose rocks such that between two chosen rocks there are at least two soils? 

      But note: the segment between two rocks has length L. We remove one from the left and one from the right. So we require L>=2? 

      Actually, no: if L=1, we remove two soils from a segment of one soil -> impossible.

      If L=0, we remove two soils from a segment of zero -> impossible.

      If L>=2, then we remove two soils, leaving L-2 soils in the middle.

      But note: the segment between the rocks is only affected by the two rocks: we remove the first and last soil. Then the remaining soils form a contiguous segment of length L-2? Actually, no: because the segment is contiguous. Removing the first and last soil leaves the segment broken? 

      Actually, the segment is contiguous only if we remove the boundaries? For example, segment: [s0, s1, s2, ..., s_{L-1}]. 
        Removing the first soil: s0 is gone -> then the segment becomes [s1, s2, ..., s_{L-1}].
        Then removing the last soil: s_{L-1} is gone -> then the segment becomes [s1, s2, ..., s_{L-2}]. 
        This is contiguous and of length L-2.

      So it's valid.

      Therefore, we can choose any set of non-adjacent rocks in the rock array? But what if we skip one rock? 

      Example: three rocks at positions i, i+1, i+2, and the segments between i and i+1 has length 2, and between i+1 and i+2 has length 2. Can we use rock i and rock i+2? 
          - Rock i: requires the segment to the left of i and the segment between i and i+1. We remove the last soil from the left segment and the first soil from the middle segment.
          - Rock i+2: requires the segment between i+1 and i+2 and the segment to the right of i+2. We remove the last soil from the segment between i+1 and i+2 and the first soil from the right segment.
          - The segment between i and i+1: originally length 2, removed the first soil -> becomes length 1.
          - The segment between i+1 and i+2: originally length 2, removed the last soil -> becomes length 1.
          - But then what about rock i+1? We didn use it. It is still eligible? 
                It has: left neighbor: the last soil of the segment between i and i+1 (which is now at position i+1-1 = i+0? -> wait, we removed the first soil of the segment between i and i+1, which was at i+1. Actually, the segment between i and i+1 is from i+1 to i+1+ (length-1) -> positions: i+1 and i+2? 
                But we remove the first soil of that segment: which is at i+1. Then the segment between i and i+1 becomes [i+2]. 
                Then the left neighbor of rock i+1 is at i (rock) -> then the cell at i+1-1 = i, which is rock -> not soil. 
                Similarly, the right neighbor of rock i+1 is at i+1+1 = i+2. But we haven't removed that for rock i+2 yet? Actually, we will remove the first soil of the segment between i+1 and i+2 for rock i+2? But that segment is from i+1+1 to i+2-1 -> which is only one cell at i+2. Then we remove the first soil of that segment: which is at i+2. 
                Then the right neighbor of rock i+1 is at i+2, but that cell is now removed? Or not yet? 

          This is messy.

Given the complexity, we can use a DP over the rocks that also carries the state of the segment to the left.

But note: the segment to the left of rock i is segment i. We only care about how many soils we removed from the end of segment i? Actually, from the left of rock i, we have segment i. If we use rock i, we remove the last soil of segment i. And also, segment i might have been affected by the previous rock? Only if there is a rock to the left of rock i that is used and that is the previous rock? And that would have removed the last soil of segment i-1 and the first soil of segment i. 

Therefore, when we process rock i, the segment i has already been affected by the use of rock i-1? Specifically, if we used rock i-1, then we removed the first soil of segment i. 

So we can define state:

      dp[i][a] = maximum total ghost power we can get from the first i rocks and the segments up to segment i, and a in {0,1} indicates whether we have used rock i-1 (which affects the first soil of segment i).

      Then the effect on segment i is:

          length_i = A_i - (if we used rock i-1 then 1 else 0)   [because if we used rock i-1, we removed the first soil of segment i]

      Then for rock i:

          We can use rock i only if it is eligible and if the segment i (after removing the first soil if we used rock i-1) still has at least one soil? Actually, the eligibility for rock i requires the left neighbor to be soil. The left neighbor is the last soil of segment i? Actually, the left neighbor is the cell immediately to the left of the rock i, which is the last cell of segment i. But wait: the segment i is from the previous rock (or start) to rock i - 1. The last cell is at rock i - 1. So we require that cell to be soil -> which it is, and also that cell might be removed? Only if we have removed it? But we haven't removed any soil from the end of segment i yet. We only removed from the beginning if we used rock i-1.

          Additionally, we require the right neighbor to be soil (the first soil of segment i+1).

      But the right neighbor is not in segment i, it is in segment i+1. So it is not affected by any decision yet.

      Therefore, the eligibility for rock i is independent of our decisions? It is fixed.

      Then for rock i:

          Option1: do not use rock i.
                Then the segment i is available with length = A_i - (state a: if we used rock i-1 then 1 else 0)

          Option2: use rock i, but then we require:
                - rock i is eligible.
                - the segment i has at least one soil (i.e., the length after removing the first soil (if any) is at least 1).

          If we use rock i, then we get G3 and we remove the last soil of segment i. Additionally, we will remove the first soil of segment i+1 (which will be recorded in the state for the next rock).

      Then the effect on segment i: we can cover the entire segment i (with length = A_i - a) but if we use rock i, then we remove the last soil, so the segment i has effective length = (A_i - a) - 1.

      But note: we can also cover the segment i with Type-1 and Type-2 tiles. We will compute the maximum ghost power we can get from segment i with length L = (A_i - a) or (A_i - a - 1) [depending on whether we use the rock i].

      However, the ghost power from segment i is not simply added because it also depends on how many Type-1 tiles we use. But we have a global constraint: at most K Type-1 tiles.

      This suggests that we cannot separate the segments easily because the distribution of Type-1 tiles is global.

This is the main challenge: the Type-1 tiles are limited globally, while the segments are many and long.

Alternative Insight:

  We note that the entire yard without the Type-3 tiles is a set of independent soil segments. And Type-3 tiles remove two soils (one from the left segment and one from the right segment) and one rock. 

  Let T = number of Type-3 tiles used.

  Then the total number of soil cells available for Type-1 and Type-2 tiles is:

        total_soil = (number of '.' in the string) - 2 * T.

  Now, for Type-1 and Type-2 tiles, we cover some of these soil cells. We know that Type-2 tile covers two cells and gives G2, Type-1 tile covers one cell and gives G1.

  Let x = number of Type-1 tiles, y = number of Type-2 tiles.

  Then: x + 2y = covered_soil, and we have x <= K.

  The ghost power from these tiles is: x * G1 + y * G2.

  But note: we are not required to cover all soil cells. So we can leave some uncovered. However, leaving a cell uncovered gives 0.

  Therefore, for a fixed T, the problem reduces to:

        covered_soil = total_soil - 2*T   [because we've removed 2*T soils for the Type-3 tiles]

        Then we maximize: 
             f(x,y) = x*G1 + y*G2 
        subject to:
             x + 2y <= covered_soil   [but we can also cover any amount up to covered_soil]
             x <= K
             x,y >= 0

  However, note: we might not cover all soil cells. But we can always cover any subset. So for a fixed covered_soil value, we can choose x and y such that x+2y = c for any c between 0 and covered_soil.

  But then we want to maximize f(x,y) over c from 0 to covered_soil and over x,y with x+2y=c and x<=K.

  We can write: y = (c - x)/2, so then:

        f(x) = x * G1 + ((c - x) // 2) * G2   [if we use as many Type-2 as possible]

  But note: we can also leave an odd cell untiled? Or use a Type-1 for it.

  Alternatively, we can precompute the maximum ghost power we can get from covering c soil cells with Type-1 and Type-2 tiles, with the constraint that the number of Type-1 tiles is at most K.

  Let g(c) = maximum ghost power from covering c soil cells.

        g(c) = max { x * G1 + y * G2 : x + 2y = c, 0<=x<=min(c,K) } 

        But note: x can be any value from 0 to min(c,K) and y = (c-x)/2 if c-x is even? Or if c-x is odd, then we floor it? -> But wait, we cannot cover a fraction of a cell. We require x+2y <= c, and then we can leave the rest. But leaving cells untiled gives 0, so it is never beneficial to leave a cell that could be covered by a tile that has nonnegative ghost power? But if G1 or G2 is 0, then it doesn't matter.

        However, the problem: we can cover exactly c cells? Or we can cover at most c cells? And we want to maximize the ghost power.

        Since leaving a cell uncovered gives 0, and using a tile gives nonnegative ghost power (G1,G2>=0), then we should cover as many cells as possible? Not necessarily: because if G2 > 2*G1, then we prefer to use Type-2 tiles. But if we have an odd cell, we might be forced to use a Type-1 for the last cell. But if we are limited by K, then we might not be able to use a Type-1 for it.

        Therefore, g(c) = max_{x} { x * G1 + floor((c - x)/2) * G2 } 
                   for x in [0, min(c, K)] and such that (c-x) is nonnegative.

        But note: we can also cover less than c cells? But then we would get less. Since ghost power is nonnegative, we always want to cover as many as we can in the best way.

        Actually, we can cover exactly x + 2y cells, and we can choose x and y to be any nonnegative integers such that x+2y <= c, and x<=K.

        So g(c) = max_{x in [0, min(c, K)], y>=0, x+2y<=c} { x * G1 + y * G2 }

        This is a linear programming in integers. We can also write:

            g(c) = max_{y=0}^{floor(c/2)} [ min(K, c - 2y) * G1 + y * G2 ]

        But then we can try to maximize over y.

        Alternatively, we can reframe: let y be the number of Type-2 tiles, then the remaining cells = c - 2y, and we can cover at most min(K, c-2y) cells with Type-1. Then:

            g(c) = max_{y=0}^{floor(c/2)} [ min(K, c - 2y) * G1 + y * G2 ]

        But note: we are allowed to leave cells uncovered, so we might not cover the entire c-2y with Type-1? But if G1>=0, then covering more cells with Type-1 is at least as good as leaving them. So we will cover min(K, c-2y) cells with Type-1.

        Therefore, we have g(c) = max_{y} [ min(K, c - 2y) * G1 + y * G2 ] for y in the range [0, floor(c/2)].

        However, c can be up to 100,000 and we have to do this for every c and then for every T? But T is at most 50, so we can iterate T from 0 to at most 50. But c = total_soil - 2*T, and total_soil up to 100,000. And for each c, we need to compute g(c) by iterating y? That would be O(c) per c, and c up to 100,000, and T up to 50 -> 50 * 100,000 = 5e6, which is acceptable.

        But note: we have to do this for every T? Actually, we are iterating T from 0 to the maximum possible (at most 50), and for each T, c = total_soil - 2*T.

        However, then the total ghost power = g(c) + T * G3.

        But wait: is that all? 

        We forgot: the eligibility of the rocks for Type-3 tiles. We cannot use any T rocks; we can only use non-adjacent rocks (in the rock array) and only if the segment between two chosen rocks has at least 2 soils? Actually, we don't require the segment between to have at least 2 soils for the purpose of eligibility, but we require that the left and right segments have at least 1 soil. However, when we use a Type-3 tile, we remove one soil from the left segment and one from the right segment. But then the function g(c) for the entire soil is for the whole yard? 

        This approach is for the entire yard: total_soil = number of '.'.

        But then we remove 2*T soils, and the remaining soil cells are distributed in the yard. However, the removals are not arbitrary: they are specifically the soils adjacent to the chosen rocks. And the remaining soils may not be contiguous? 

        Example: the yard "..#..." -> total_soil = 4. 
            Without any Type-3: we have two segments: [0,1] and [3,5] -> lengths 2 and 3.
            If we use one Type-3 tile (on the rock at index2), then we remove the soil at index1 and index3. Then the remaining soils are at index0 and index4,5? 
                  Actually, the yard becomes: 
                        0: '.' -> not removed
                        1: removed
                        2: covered by Type-3
                        3: removed
                        4: '.' -> remains
                        5: '.' -> remains
                   So we have two isolated soils at index0 and two consecutive at index4,5.

            Then we have to cover these with Type-1 and Type-2. But our function g(c) for c=4-2=2 might assume we can cover 2 cells arbitrarily. However, the cells are not contiguous: we cannot put a Type-2 tile on index0 and index4 because they are not consecutive.

        Therefore, we cannot aggregate the entire soil cells. The removals for Type-3 tiles might break the yard into more segments? 

        Specifically, each Type-3 tile removes two soils that might be in different segments. And then the remaining soils are still in segments. And the covering of Type-1 and Type-2 tiles is done per segment independently.

        So we must account for the segments separately. 

        Let the yard have m+1 segments. 
          Segment i has length A_i.

          Then, if we use a set S of rocks, the available soil in segment i is:

               L_i = A_i - (indicator: if the rock to the left is in S) - (indicator: if the rock to the right is in S)

          and we require L_i >=0.

          Then the total ghost power = 
                (sum over segments i of ghost power from segment i, which is a function of L_i and the number of Type-1 tiles allocated to segment i) 
                + |S| * G3.

          And the total number of Type-1 tiles used over all segments is at most K.

        This is a knapsack-like problem: segments are items, each segment i has a function f_i(x_i) = maximum ghost power that can be obtained from segment i of length L_i using x_i Type-1 tiles (and unlimited Type-2 tiles), and then we sum over i and also add |S|*G3.

        The function f_i(x_i) for a segment of length L_i:

               Let y_i = number of Type-2 tiles in segment i.
               Then we require: x_i + 2 * y_i <= L_i, and we want to maximize: x_i * G1 + y_i * G2.

               This is the same as g_i(L_i) = max_{x_i} { x_i * G1 + floor((L_i - x_i)/2) * G2 } for x_i in [0, min(L_i, K_i)] but note we have a global K.

        Actually, we can precompute for a segment of length L_i the maximum ghost power as a function of the number of Type-1 tiles used in that segment. However, we have to combine segments with a global constraint on the total Type-1 tiles.

        Let F(X) = maximum total ghost power from all segments using a total of X Type-1 tiles.

        Then F(X) = sum_i f_i(x_i) with sum_i x_i = X.

        And f_i(x_i) = max_{y_i} { x_i * G1 + y_i * G2 } subject to x_i + 2*y_i <= L_i.

               = x_i * G1 + floor((L_i - x_i)/2) * G2   ??? 

        But wait: we are allowed to leave cells. But we can also choose to cover fewer than L_i cells? However, if G2>0, then we would always want to cover as many as possible with Type-2 tiles first, and then use Type-1 for the remainder? 

        Actually, for a fixed segment of length L_i and fixed x_i (number of Type-1 tiles used in this segment), the best we can do is to use floor((L_i - x_i)/2) Type-2 tiles, because covering two cells is better than covering two cells with two Type-1 if G2>=2*G1? But the function is linear.

        However, note: we might be better off not using all cells? But if G1>=0 and G2>=0, then using more cells gives more ghost power.

        Therefore, for a given x_i, the ghost power from segment i is:

             x_i * G1 + floor((L_i - x_i)/2) * G2

        Then F(X) = sum_i [ x_i * G1 + floor((L_i - x_i)/2) * G2 ]

        But then we also have the constraint that the total X = sum_i x_i <= K.

        And we want to maximize F(X) + (|S| * G3) over the choices of S and the allocation of Type-1 tiles.

        However, the catch: the lengths L_i depend on S.

        Therefore, we would iterate over the set S of rocks (at most 50, and they are not consecutive in the array? -> but as we've seen, we can use a DP over the rocks for choosing S, and within that DP we would also do a knapsack over the segments? 

        This is too expensive.

Given the complexity, there is a known solution in the Competitive Programming community for this problem. The known solution uses:

  - Precompute the positions of the rocks.
  - Use a DP over the rocks: dp[i][j] where i is the index of the rock and j is the number of Type-3 tiles used so far, and the state also of the segment to the left. But the state can be the number of soils left in the current segment (which is the segment to the left of the current rock) after accounting for the Type-3 tiles on the left. 

  - Or use a state that is the number of soils that are left at the boundary of the next segment.

  Given the low bound on the number of rocks (50) and also the fact that the only effect on the segments is the first and last soils, we can design a DP that goes over the rocks and also carries the state of the segment to the left (which might be affected by the previous rock) and then also the global count of Type-1 tiles used? 

  But K can be up to 100,000, so we cannot iterate over K.

  Alternatively, we can separate the problem: the total ghost power = (power from Type-3) + (power from Type-1 and Type-2).

  and for Type-1 and Type-2, the power from a segment of length L is a function that we denoted f(L) = max_{x in [0, min(L, K)]} { x * G1 + floor((L-x)/2) * G2 }.

  But then if we could compute the total soil available for Type-1 and Type-2 as a function of S, and the segments are independent, then the total power from Type-1 and Type-2 is the sum of f(L_i) over segments i.

  However, the allocation of Type-1 tiles is global. So we would need to knaps the segments for the Type-1 allocation. 

  Let we have segments of lengths L_0, L_1, ..., L_m.

  For each segment i, the function f_i is f_i(x_i) = x_i * G1 + floor((L_i - x_i)/2) * G2, and we want to maximize sum_i f_i(x_i) subject to sum_i x_i <= K.

  This is not separable because floor function. 

  But note: floor((L_i - x_i)/2) = (L_i - x_i - (L_i - x_i) % 2) / 2 * G2.

  And the function is concave? 

  Actually, for a fixed segment, as x_i increases by 1, the change in f_i is:

        df_i = G1 - floor((L_i - x_i)/2)*G2 + floor((L_i - x_i -1)/2)*G2

  = G1 - [ floor((L_i - x_i)/2) - floor((L_i - x_i -1)/2) ] * G2

  The term in floor: if (L_i - x_i) is even, say =2k, then floor(2k/2)=k, floor((2k-1)/2)=k-1, so difference = 1 -> df_i = G1 - G2.
        if (L_i - x_i) is odd, say=2k+1, then floor((2k+1)/2)=k, floor(2k/2)=k, so difference=0 -> df_i = G1.

  Therefore, the function f_i(x_i) is piecewise linear, and the slope changes from G1 to G1 - G2 when x_i = L_i - 2k for integer k.

  Then the function f_i is concave. Therefore, we can allocate Type-1 tiles in the order of the segments by the current slope. This is a greedy allocation.

  Specifically, the incremental value of an additional Type-1 in segment i is:

        slope_i(x_i) = 
             G1, if (L_i - x_i) is odd
             G1 - G2, if (L_i - x_i) is even and >0
             0, if L_i - x_i ==0.

  Initially, x_i=0, and slope_i(0) = 
        G1 if L_i is odd, 
        G1 - G2 if L_i is even.

  Then we can use a heap to allocate Type-1 tiles: always allocate to the segment with the highest slope.

  However, note: after allocating one Type-1 to a segment, the slope for that segment changes.

  For example, if L_i is even, then initially slope = G1 - G2. 
        After one allocation, x_i=1, then L_i - x_i = L_i-1 (odd), so slope becomes G1.
        After two allocations, x_i=2, then L_i-x_i = L_i-2 (even), slope = G1 - G2.

  So the slope toggles between G1 and G1-G2.

  Therefore, we can simulate the allocation of Type-1 tiles from 0 to K:

        Use a priority queue where each segment i has:
            current_slope_i = ( if we haven't allocated any, then initial_slope = (L_i % 2 == 1 ? G1 : G1 - G2) )
        But note: if G1 - G2 <0, then we might not want to allocate.

        Then we allocate one Type-1 to the segment with the highest current_slope.

        Then update that segment: 
            new_slope = ( if the new state (x_i+1) has (L_i - x_i -1) being even -> then next slope will be G1 - G2? 
            Actually, after allocation, the new parity: 
                if previously the available soil was even, then slope was G1 - G2, and after allocation, available soil becomes odd -> slope becomes G1.
                if previously slope was G1 (available soil was odd), then after allocation, available soil becomes even -> slope becomes G1 - G2.

        But note: if the available soil becomes zero, then slope becomes 0.

  We can do this for up to K steps. K can be 100,000, and we have up to 51 segments (because at most 50 rocks -> 51 segments). So we would do at most K * log(51) which is 100,000 * log2(51) ~ 100,000 * 6 = 600,000, which is acceptable.

  Therefore, the plan is:

        Step 1: 
             Count the total soil = total_dot = number of '.' in the string.
             Identify the positions of the rocks: let R be the sorted list of indices where s[i]=='#'. Let m = len(R).

        Step 2:
             total_type3 = 0  // we will try all possible number of Type-3 tiles? But the eligible rocks are at most 50, and we can only use a subset, and the subset cannot include two rocks consecutive in the array if the segment between them has length<2? -> Actually, we can use a DP over the rocks for the choice of S.

        Given the complexity of the interaction, we iterate over the number of Type-3 tiles we use? not directly.

        Alternatively, we iterate over the rocks with a DP that also does the greedy allocation for Type-1 in the segments? 

        Given the time, we might as well do a DP over the rocks for the state of the left segment's boundary and also the current total Type-1 allocation? -> not possible because K is large.

        Known solution from accepted codes:

          for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= bound; j++) {
              dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]; // not use rock i
              // use rock i: only if eligible and not adjacent to the previous chosen rock?
            }
          }

        But state j might be the number of Type-3 used, and then we have to also compute the soil segments. This is not promising.

        Another known solution: 

          // first, without Type-3, the segments are the m+1 segments.
          // then, when we use a Type-3 tile on a rock, we merge the two adjacent segments and remove one soil from each.

          // initially, segments are separate. When we use a Type-3 at rock i, we take one soil from the left segment and one from the right segment, and then we merge the left and right segments (because the and the soils in between become one segment) -> wait, not exactly: the soils between the rocks might be non-empty, and we only remove the boundaries.

          // but after using the Type-3 tile, the two segments on the left and right become connected? -> no, because the rock is in the middle and we covered the rock and the two adjacent soils. Then the yard becomes: ... [soil] rock [soil] ... -> after covering: ... [soil-1] (covered) (covered) [soil-1] ... 
          // and the two segments are still separated by the now-covered rock? 

          // actually, the rock is covered, but the cells are still there; however, the soils are removed. So the segments remain, but shorter. 

          // therefore, the segments are always separated by rocks.

        So we 

 We are not going to ( within the length) complete a full solution. 

Given the complexity and the constraints (50 rocks), we can iterate over the number of Type-3 tiles from 0 to the maximum possible (which is at most 50) and for each number, 
  determine the minimum number of soils that must be removed (2 * T) and the effect on the segments. 

But then we also need to know the lengths of the segments after the Type-3 removes the boundary soils. 

 However, to know the effect on the segments, we need to know not only the number of Type-3 tiles but also the specific set, because the segments are affected by their neighbors.

 Therefore, we must iterate over the eligible rocks in a DP that respects the condition that we cannot use two consecutive rocks in the array if the segment between them has length<2. In the DP, we in for each rock i, we a state whether we used the previous rock or not. 

 Let's define:

      dp[i][0] = maximum total ghost power from the first i rocks and we did not use rock i.
      dp[i][1] = maximum total ghost power from the first i rocks and we used rock i.

 Then for rock i to be usable, it must be eligible and also the previous rock must not be used if the segment between i-1 and i has length<2? 
        But note: if we use rock i, we require that the left and right segments have at least one soil. 
        Additionally, if we used rock i-1, then we already removed the first soil of the segment between i-1 and i. Then for rock i, the left neighbor is the last soil of the segment between i-1 and i. But after using rock i-1, that segment has length = (original_length) - 1 (because we removed the first soil). Then for rock i, we require that the left segment (segment between i-1 and i) has at least one soil -> which it does (>=1) and the right segment has at least one soil.

        However, when we use rock i, we remove the last soil of the segment between i-1 and i. But if the segment between i-1 and i has exactly 1 soil (after possibly remove the first soil by rock i-1), then we remove the only soil -> the segment becomes empty, which is valid. 

        Therefore, the only constraint is the eligibility of the rock in the original string and that we don't care about the segment length as long as the immediate neighbors are soil in the original string.

      So we only require that the rock i is eligible.

      Then recurrence:

          dp[i][0] = max(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1])

          dp[i][1] = if eligible[i] is True, then 
                       G3 + (value from the changes in the segments) + max(dp[i-1][0], ( if i>=1, we can use dp[i-1][1] only if the rock i-1 is not adjacent to i? 

          wait, we must account for the segments. Specifically, the power from the segments is not included in dp[i-1] because the segments are shared.

      This approach is not viable.

Given the complexity and the known bound (50), we can iterate over the subset of eligible rocks. There are at most 50 eligible rocks, and the condition is that we cannot use two rocks that are consecutive in the array if the segment between them has length<2. But as discussed, if they are consecutive in the array, the segment between them has length = (position[i] - position[i-1] - 1), and we require >=2 to use both. 

 Therefore, we can do:

        for mask in range(0, 1<<m_eligible):  # m_eligible <=50, but 2^50 is too big.

        So we need a DP over the eligible rocks index.

        Let eligible_rocks = list of eligible rock indices ( in increasing order).

        Let dp[ i ] = maximum number of Type-3 tiles we can use from the first i eligible_rocks, and also the effect on the segments. 

        But the effect on the segments is that we remove one soil from the left segment and one from the right segment of each used rock. 

        However, the segments between two eligible_rocks might be shared. 

        Specifically, if we have eligible_rocks = [r0, r1, ..., r_{k-1}], then the segment between eligible_rock i and i+1 is the cells between r_i+1 and r_{i+1}-1. The length of this segment = (r_{i+1} - r_i - 1).

        When we use a Type-3 on rock i, we remove the soil at r_i-1 (which is in the segment to the left of r_i) and at r_i+1 ( which is in the segment to the right of r_i, which is the segment between r_i and r_{i+1}) or if i is the last, the last segment.

        When we use two eligible_rocks i and i+1, we remove the soil at r_i+1 and at r_{i+1}-1. 
             - The soil at r_i+1 is the first soil of the segment between r_i and r_{i+1}.
             - The soil at r_{i+1}-1 is the last soil of the segment between r_i and r_{i+1}.

        Therefore, the segment between r_i and r_{i+1} has length L = (r_{i+1} - r_i - 1), and we remove two soils, so it becomes L-2.

        Additionally, the soil at the boundary of the far left and far right are also removed.

        Then the.
