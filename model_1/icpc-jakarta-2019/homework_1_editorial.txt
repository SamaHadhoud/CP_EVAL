### Approach
The problem requires finding any permutation \( B \) of integers from 1 to \( N \) such that the sum of absolute differences between the given permutation \( A \) and \( B \) (i.e., \( \sum_{i=1}^{N} |A_i - B_i| \)) is at least \( N \). 

#### Key Insight
A simple and efficient solution is to use a cyclic shift of the array \( A \). Specifically, shifting each element of \( A \) to the left by one position (with the first element moving to the end) ensures that the resulting permutation \( B \) meets the required condition. 

#### Why This Works
- **Cyclic Shift**: For \( B \), each element \( B_i \) is set to \( A_{(i+1) \mod N} \). This means:
  - \( B_0 = A_1 \)
  - \( B_1 = A_2 \)
  - ...
  - \( B_{N-1} = A_0 \)
- **Sum of Absolute Differences**: The sum \( \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} |A_i - B_i| \) becomes \( \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} |A_i - A_{(i+1) \mod N}| \). This sum represents the total variation along a cycle that includes all elements of \( A \).
- **Lower Bound**: Since \( A \) is a permutation of distinct integers from 1 to \( N \), the sum of absolute differences along the cycle is at least twice the difference between the maximum and minimum values in \( A \). This difference is \( 2 \times (N-1) \). For \( N \geq 2 \), \( 2 \times (N-1) \geq N \), ensuring the condition is satisfied.

#### Algorithm Selection
The cyclic shift approach is chosen for its simplicity and efficiency. It processes the array in linear time \( O(N) \) and uses constant extra space (excluding the input and output storage), making it optimal for the constraints \( (2 \leq N \leq 100,000) \).

### Solution Code
```python
n = int(input().strip())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))

if n == 1:
    print(A[0])
else:
    print(" ".join(map(str, A[1:] + [A[0]])))
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The first line reads the integer \( N \), the size of the permutation. The second line reads the permutation \( A \) of \( N \) distinct integers.
2. **Handling Edge Case**: Although \( N \geq 2 \) is guaranteed, if \( N \) were 1 (handled for completeness), the output is the single element.
3. **Cyclic Shift**: For \( N \geq 2 \), the solution constructs \( B \) by shifting each element of \( A \) one position to the left. The first element of \( A \) moves to the end of \( B \).
4. **Output**: The resulting permutation \( B \) is printed as space-separated integers.

This approach efficiently generates a valid permutation \( B \) by leveraging the cyclic shift property, ensuring the sum of absolute differences \( \sum |A_i - B_i| \) meets the problem's requirement of being at least \( N \). The solution is optimal with \( O(N) \) time complexity and \( O(N) \) space complexity.
