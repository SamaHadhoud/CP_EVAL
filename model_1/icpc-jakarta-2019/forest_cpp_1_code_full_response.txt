To solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a node in a given tree such that removing it results in a forest where all the resulting trees are identical (isomorphic). If such a node exists, we should return the maximum number of identical trees obtained by removing one such node; otherwise, return -1.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires finding a node (called a good cutting point) whose removal splits the tree into two or more disconnected subtrees that are all pairwise identical (isomorphic). The number of subtrees is equal to the degree of the node (since each subtree is connected to the node via an edge).
2. **Constraints**: The candidate node must have a degree of at least 2, and the total number of nodes in the tree (excluding the candidate node) must be divisible by the degree of the node. This ensures that all resulting subtrees have the same number of nodes.
3. **Tree Isomorphism**: After verifying the size condition, we need to check if all the resulting subtrees are identical. This involves:
   - **Finding Centers**: For each subtree, identify its center(s) (either 1 or 2 nodes) which help in determining a canonical representation of the tree.
   - **Tree Hashing**: Compute a hash for each subtree rooted at its center(s). The canonical hash of the subtree is the minimum of the hashes when rooted at each center (to handle symmetric cases).

### Explanation
1. **Input Reading and Initialization**: The input is read and the tree is stored as an adjacency list. The degree of each node is also computed.
2. **Candidate Node Check**: For each node, we check if its degree is at least 2 and if the total number of nodes minus one is divisible by the degree. This ensures that removing the node splits the tree into subtrees of equal size.
3. **Component Extraction**: For each candidate node, we perform BFS to extract the connected components formed by its removal. Each component is stored as a list of nodes.
4. **Size Validation**: We verify that all extracted components have the same size. If not, the node is skipped.
5. **Tree Isomorphism Check**: For each component:
   - **Center Identification**: Using a leaf removal algorithm, we find the center(s) of the component.
   - **Tree Hashing**: We compute a hash for the component by traversing it in BFS order from each center. The canonical hash is the minimum of these hashes.
6. **Result Compilation**: If all components of a candidate node have the same canonical hash, the node is a good cutting point. We update the answer to the maximum such degree encountered.
7. **Output**: The maximum number of identical trees obtained by removing a good cutting point is printed, or -1 if no such node exists. 

This approach efficiently checks each candidate node and leverages tree hashing to verify isomorphism, ensuring correctness within feasible computational limits.
