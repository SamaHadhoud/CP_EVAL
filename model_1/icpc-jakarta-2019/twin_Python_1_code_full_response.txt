To solve this problem, we need to determine the largest possible rectangular building size (A × B) such that two identical buildings of this size can be constructed on available lands. The buildings can be placed either on a single land or on two different lands, considering various orientation constraints.

### Approach
1. **Normalize Land Dimensions**: For each land, represent its dimensions as (long_i, short_i), where long_i is the maximum of the land's length and width, and short_i is the minimum. This simplifies the placement conditions by allowing the building to be rotated.
2. **Single Land Option (Option 1)**: Calculate the maximum possible area for a building that can be placed on a single land. The area per building in this case is half the land's area (since two buildings must fit on the same land). The candidate for this option is the maximum value of (long_i × short_i) across all lands, divided by 2.
3. **Two Lands Option (Option 2)**: For this option, we need to find two different lands where each can accommodate one building. The building's longer side must be less than or equal to the minimum of the two lands' longer sides, and the shorter side must be less than or equal to the minimum of the two lands' shorter sides. To efficiently compute this:
   - **Sort Lands**: Sort the lands by their longer side in descending order.
   - **Sweep with Tracking**: Traverse the sorted list while maintaining the maximum short side encountered (max_short). For each land, compute the candidate building area as the product of the current land's longer side and the minimum of its short side and max_short. Track the maximum such product (candidate_two) during the traversal.
4. **Determine Result**: Compare the results from both options. The final answer is the maximum between (candidate_one / 2) and candidate_two. The output is formatted to one decimal place, ensuring integer values are printed as "X.0" and half-integers as "X.5".

### Solution Code
```python
import sys

def main():
    data = sys.stdin.read().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    lands = []
    for i in range(n):
        L = int(data[1+2*i])
        W = int(data[1+2*i+1])
        long_i = max(L, W)
        short_i = min(L, W)
        lands.append((long_i, short_i))
    
    candidate_one = 0
    for long_i, short_i in lands:
        product = long_i * short_i
        if product > candidate_one:
            candidate_one = product
            
    lands.sort(key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)
    
    candidate_two = 0
    max_short = 0
    for long_i, short_i in lands:
        if max_short > 0:
            temp = min(short_i, max_short)
            candidate_ij = long_i * temp
            if candidate_ij > candidate_two:
                candidate_two = candidate_ij
        if short_i > max_short:
            max_short = short_i
            
    if candidate_one >= 2 * candidate_two:
        half_area = candidate_one // 2
        if candidate_one % 2 == 0:
            print(f"{half_area}.0")
        else:
            print(f"{half_area}.5")
    else:
        print(f"{candidate_two}.0")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into land dimensions, which are normalized to (long_i, short_i) for easier processing.
2. **Single Land Calculation**: The maximum product (long_i × short_i) across all lands is stored as candidate_one. This represents the largest area a single land can offer for two buildings (each building would then have an area of candidate_one / 2).
3. **Two Lands Calculation**:
   - **Sorting**: Lands are sorted by their longer side in descending order to process larger lands first.
   - **Sweeping**: For each land, the algorithm checks all previously processed lands (with longer sides >= current land's longer side) to compute the best possible building area (candidate_ij). The maximum short side encountered (max_short) is maintained to efficiently compute constraints. The candidate_ij for the current land is the product of its longer side and the minimum of its short side and max_short.
4. **Result Determination**: The result is derived by comparing candidate_one / 2 (single land option) and candidate_two (two lands option). The larger value is printed, formatted to one decimal place (integer as "X.0", half-integer as "X.5").

This approach efficiently handles both placement options and leverages sorting and sweeping to maximize the building area within feasible constraints. The complexity is O(N log N) due to sorting, which is optimal for the given constraints.
