 We are going to follow the editorial exactly.

 Steps:
 1. Normalize each land: for each land (L_i, W_i), we set:
        long_i = max(L_i, W_i)
        short_i = min(L_i, W_i)

 2. Calculate candidate_one: the maximum area we can get from one land (which is long_i * short_i). 
    But note: when we build two buildings on one land, the maximum building area we can get is (long_i * short_i) / 2.

 3. For candidate_two (two lands option):
    - We sort the lands by long_i in descending order.
    - We traverse the sorted list and keep track of the maximum short_i we have seen so far (max_short).
    - For the current land (long_i, short_i):
          We consider the building that can be placed on two lands: 
          The building must have:
              A (the longer building side) <= min(long_i, long_j) [but note: we are processing in descending long_i, so long_i <= long_j for all j we have seen? Actually, we are going from large long_i to small, so when we process a land, we have already processed lands with long_i >= current long_i. But we are storing max_short from the processed lands (which have larger or equal long_i).]

          However, the building must also have the shorter building side <= min(short_i, short_j). But note: we are using the current land and one of the previously processed lands (which have at least the same long_i or larger). The building's dimensions (A, B) must satisfy:
              A <= min(long_i, long_j) = long_i   (because we are processing in descending order, so previously seen lands have long_j >= current long_i -> min(long_i, long_j) = long_i)
              B <= min(short_i, short_j) = min(short_i, max_short)   [but note: max_short is the maximum short among the lands we have seen, but we need the min between short_i and the other land's short? Actually, the building's shorter side must be <= min(short_i, short_j) for both lands. However, we are going to use two lands: one is the current and one from the past. For the building to fit in both, the shorter side must be <= min(short_i, short_j) and the longer side must be <= min(long_i, long_j). Since we have sorted by long_i descending, for the current land i and a previously seen land j: 
                min(long_i, long_j) = long_i (because long_j >= long_i) 
                and the building's shorter side must be <= min(short_i, short_j). 

          But note: we are going to assign the building's dimensions as (A, B) where A is the building's longer side and B the shorter? Actually, we are free to assign which is which. However, the building can be rotated. So for the two lands option, we can set:
                building_long = long_i   [because we are constrained by the min(long_i, long_j) = long_i]
                building_short = min(short_i, max_short)   [but wait: we have multiple lands? Actually, we are comparing with the best land we have seen so far. However, note that the building must fit in both lands. The building's longer side must be <= long_i (which is the smallest of the two long sides) and the building's shorter side must be <= min(short_i, short_j) for the two lands. However, the building's shorter side must be <= min(short_i, short_j) for the two lands we choose. But we are considering the current land and the best candidate from the past (with the largest short_i). However, the building's shorter side must be at most min(short_i, short_j) for the land j we choose. But we are taking the max_short from the past, which is the maximum short_i we have seen. However, the min(short_i, max_short) might not be the best if we have a land with a huge short? Actually, we want to maximize the building area: long_i * min(short_i, max_short). But note: we are not forced to use the building dimensions as (long_i, min(short_i, max_short)). Actually, we can set:
                A = long_i   (the longer building side) and B = min(short_i, max_short)   -> but note: it is possible that min(short_i, max_short) is larger than long_i? Then we would swap? However, by our normalization, long_i is at least as big as short_i. And max_short is also from a normalized land (so <= its long, but we don't know relative to current long_i). But long_i is the current land's long, and we are taking min(short_i, max_short) which is at most short_i, which is at most long_i. So A = long_i and B = min(short_i, max_short) is acceptable? 

          However, the building might not need to have its longer side set to long_i. Actually, we want to maximize the area. The constraint for the building is:
                building_long <= min(long_i, long_j) = long_i
                building_short <= min(short_i, short_j)   [for the two lands]

          We are free to choose building_long and building_short as long as building_long >= building_short and the above holds. To maximize the area, we can set:
                building_long = min(long_i, long_j) = long_i   [because we are constrained by the smaller long]
                building_short = min(short_i, short_j)   [because we are constrained by the smaller short of the two lands]

          Then the area = long_i * min(short_i, short_j). But note: we are traversing with the current land, and we have seen a land j with short_j = max_short. However, we want min(short_i, short_j) to be as large as possible? Actually, we are tracking the maximum short we have seen (max_short). But when we compute min(short_i, max_short), it is the best we can get for the current land? Not exactly: because if we have multiple lands, we want the min(short_i, short_j) for the land j that gives the largest min(short_i, short_j). However, if we fix the current land, then the best candidate for land j is the one that has the largest short_j (because min(short_i, short_j) is maximized when short_j is as large as possible, but bounded by short_i). So the best we can get for the current land is min(short_i, max_short). 

          Therefore, the candidate for the current land is: 
                candidate_ij = long_i * min(short_i, max_short)

          However, note: we can also assign the building such that the longer side is not long_i? Actually, we have two constraints: 
                building_long <= long_i and building_long <= long_j (which is at least long_i, so building_long <= long_i) 
                building_short <= short_i and building_short <= short_j.

          But we are free to set building_long to any value <= long_i and building_short to any value <= min(short_i, short_j). However, to maximize the area we set building_long = long_i and building_short = min(short_i, max_short) only if that is the best? But note: we might set building_long to a value less than long_i and building_short to min(short_i, max_short) and get the same area? Actually, the area is building_long * building_short. If we set building_long to a value less than long_i, then we might be able to set building_short to something larger? But building_short is bounded by min(short_i, max_short) and also by building_long (if we are to keep building_long as the longer side). Actually, the building must be placed in two orientations arbitrarily. The building can be rotated. So we can set:
                A = min(long_i, min(short_i, max_short))   [if we set the building to be square-like?] 
                B = min(short_i, max_short)   [but then we must have A>=B?]

          Actually, the building's dimensions (A, B) must satisfy:
                A <= long_i, B <= short_i   OR   A <= short_i, B <= long_i   for the current land.
                A <= long_j, B <= short_j   OR   A <= short_j, B <= long_j   for the other land.

          But note: we have normalized the lands. The constraint for the current land (long_i, short_i) becomes: 
                A <= long_i and B <= short_i   (if we use the building with A>=B, then we can always orient so that the longer side A is aligned with long_i) because long_i>=short_i.

          Similarly, for the other land j: we can orient the building so that A (the longer side) is aligned with long_j (which is at least A) and B aligned with short_j (which must be at least B). 

          Therefore, the constraints are:
                A <= long_i   and   B <= short_i
                A <= long_j   and   B <= short_j

          Since we are processing lands by descending long_i, we have long_j >= long_i for the previously processed lands. Therefore, the constraint A <= long_j is automatically satisfied if A<=long_i. So we only require:
                A <= long_i
                B <= min(short_i, short_j)

          To maximize A * B, we set:
                A = long_i
                B = min(short_i, short_j)

          Then the area = long_i * min(short_i, short_j). But we want to maximize that.

          However, note: we are not forced to set A to long_i. We could set A to a value less than long_i and set B to min(short_i, short_j) and then the area would be less. So setting A to long_i is optimal.

          But wait: what if min(short_i, short_j) is greater than long_i? Then we can set A = min(short_i, short_j) and B = long_i? But note: we have the constraint that the building must have the longer side at most min(long_i, long_j)=long_i. Therefore, the building's longer side cannot exceed long_i. So we are forced to set the longer side to at most long_i and the shorter side to at most min(short_i, short_j). And if min(short_i, short_j) > long_i, then the shorter side can be set to long_i? Actually, the building's shorter side must be at most the building's longer side. So we set:
                building_long = long_i
                building_short = min( min(short_i, short_j), long_i )   [but note: min(short_i, short_j) is at most short_i, and short_i<=long_i, so min(short_i, short_j) <= long_i. So we don't have to cap?]

          Therefore, the candidate area for the current land and the best land j (with the largest short_j) is: long_i * min(short_i, max_short)

 4. Then we compare candidate_one (which is the maximum product long_i * short_i) and candidate_two (which is the maximum long_i * min(short_i, max_short) from the sweep). But note: candidate_one is the area of the entire land, and we can build two buildings of area (candidate_one/2). For candidate_two, we are building two buildings of area (candidate_two) each? Actually, no: candidate_two is the area of one building? 

    Actually, in the two lands option, each building is of size (A x B) = (long_i * min(short_i, max_short))? But wait, we computed candidate_ij = long_i * min(short_i, max_short) as the area for one building? 

    However, note: we set A = long_i and B = min(short_i, max_short). Then one building area is A * B = long_i * min(short_i, max_short). And we are building two such buildings, each of that area. So the total area is 2 * candidate_ij? But we are only asked for the area of one building.

    Therefore, the area per building for the two lands option is candidate_ij? 

    And for the single land option, the area per building is (candidate_one) / 2.

    So we have two candidate answers per building:
        candidate1 = candidate_one / 2   (from one land)
        candidate2 = candidate_two      (from two lands)

    Then the overall answer is the maximum of candidate1 and candidate2.

 5. But wait: we have computed candidate_two as the maximum over pairs? Actually, we have computed candidate_two as the maximum value of long_i * min(short_i, max_short) for the current land and the best land j we've seen so far. However, note that candidate_two is the area of one building in the two lands option.

 6. However, there is a catch: the building in the two lands option does not necessarily have to have the longer side set to long_i. We might get a larger building by setting the building dimensions differently? But note: we are constrained by the min(long_i, long_j) = long_i and min(short_i, short_j). And we set the building's longer side to the maximum possible (long_i) and the shorter side to the maximum possible (min(short_i, max_short)), which is the best we can do for that pair. 

 7. But note: the building does not require the longer side to be exactly long_i. We might set the building to be (x, y) with x<=long_i and y<=min(short_i, max_short). However, to maximize the area we set x = long_i and y = min(short_i, max_short) because if we set x to less than long_i, then we could set y to min(short_i, max_short) and get a smaller area. So that candidate is the best for the two lands option for the pair.

 8. However, there is an alternative: what if we set the building dimensions as (min(long_i, long_j), min(short_i, short_j))? But that is exactly (long_i, min(short_i, max_short))? 

 9. Therefore, the algorithm:

        candidate_one = max(long_i * short_i for all lands)

        candidate_two = 0
        Sort lands by long_i descending.
        max_short = 0
        for each land (long_i, short_i) in the sorted list:
            if max_short > 0:   # we have seen at least one land
                # The building for two lands: 
                #   A = long_i
                #   B = min(short_i, max_short)   [but note: we have the constraint that the building's longer side must be at least the shorter side? But long_i >= short_i, and min(short_i, max_short) <= short_i <= long_i, so A>=B]
                candidate_ij = long_i * min(short_i, max_short)
                if candidate_ij > candidate_two:
                    candidate_two = candidate_ij
            if short_i > max_short:
                max_short = short_i

        Then the answer per building is max(candidate_one / 2, candidate_two)

 10. But wait: what if the two buildings are built on two lands and we get a candidate_two that is less than candidate_one/2? Then we take candidate_one/2.

 11. However, note: candidate_two is the area of one building from the two lands option, and candidate_one/2 is the area of one building from the single land option.

 12. But there is a nuance: the candidate_one/2 might be achieved by one land, but candidate_two might be achieved by two lands. We are comparing the area per building.

 13. Therefore, we output:
        if candidate_one/2 >= candidate_two: then output candidate_one/2
        else: output candidate_two

 14. Format: output exactly one decimal place. 
        - If the number is an integer, output "X.0"
        - If the number is a half-integer (like 12.5), output "X.5"

 However, note: candidate_one is an integer (because L_i, W_i are integers). Then candidate_one/2 is either an integer (if candidate_one is even) or a half-integer (if odd). candidate_two is an integer? Because it's long_i * min(short_i, max_short) and both are integers.

 15. So we can do:

        if candidate_one >= 2 * candidate_two:
            # Then candidate_one/2 is the answer.
            half = candidate_one / 2.0
            # But we must output without floating point errors? Actually, the problem says output with one decimal place.
            # Since candidate_one is integer, then candidate_one/2 is either integer or half-integer.
            if candidate_one % 2 == 0:
                print(f"{candidate_one//2}.0")
            else:
                print(f"{candidate_one//2}.5")
        else:
            # candidate_two is an integer -> output as integer with .0
            print(f"{candidate_two}.0")

 16. However, note: what if candidate_two is a float? It's not: candidate_two = long_i * min(short_i, max_short) -> integer.

 17. But wait: is candidate_two computed correctly? In the sweep, we update candidate_two with the maximum candidate_ij we see. However, note: we are processing lands in descending order by long_i. But we are updating max_short as we go. When we process a land, we use the max_short from the lands processed so far (which have larger or equal long_i). 

 18. But what if we have a land with very large long_i and small short_i? Then when we process it, max_short might be 0 (if it's the first) and we skip. Then we update max_short to that short_i. Then we process a land with slightly smaller long_i but larger short_i? Then we update max_short to the larger short_i. Then when we process a land with even smaller long_i and a short_i that is not too big, we get candidate_ij = current_long_i * min(current_short_i, max_short) = current_long_i * current_short_i? 

 19. Actually, we are missing pairs that are not adjacent? The algorithm is correct: because we want to pair the current land with a land that has a large short_i and at least the same long_i (which we have processed and updated max_short). 

 20. However, note: the building must be placed on two different lands. The two lands option does not require the two lands to be adjacent in the sorted list. Our algorithm considers each land as the one with the smaller long_i and then pairs it with the best land (with the largest short_i) among the lands that have long_i at least as big as the current land. 

 21. Why is that sufficient? Because the building's longer side is constrained by the smaller long_i of the two lands. We are iterating from the largest long_i to the smallest. For a fixed land i (with long_i), the best candidate land j must have long_j>=long_i (so we have processed it) and we have recorded the maximum short_j (max_short) from those lands. Then the building's area for the pair (i, j) is long_i * min(short_i, short_j). And we take the maximum over i.

 22. But note: the building might be constrained by the other land? Actually, the building must fit on land i and land j. The building's longer side must be <= min(long_i, long_j) = long_i (since long_j>=long_i). And the building's shorter side must be <= min(short_i, short_j). Therefore, the building area we can achieve is at most long_i * min(short_i, short_j). And we are taking the maximum over j for fixed i? Actually, we are using the best j (with the largest short_j) so that min(short_i, short_j) is maximized for the current land i. 

 23. However, what if the best candidate j for land i is not the one with the maximum short_j? Actually, min(short_i, short_j) is maximized when short_j is as large as possible (until it reaches short_i). So the best candidate j is the one with the largest short_j that we've seen so far.

 24. Therefore, the algorithm is complete.

 25. But wait: what about the possibility that the building is not oriented the same way in both lands? Actually, we normalized the lands and then we are free to orient the building arbitrarily. The constraints are covered by the normalized representation.

 26. Let's test with sample inputs.

 Sample Input #1: 
        2
        5 5
        3 4

    Normalize: 
        land1: (5,5) -> candidate_one = max(5*5, ...) = 25.
        land2: (4,3) -> (4,3) -> candidate_one = max(25, 12) -> 25.

    Then sort by long_i descending: [(5,5), (4,3)]

    Traverse:
        first land: (5,5): 
            max_short is 0 -> skip candidate_ij, then set max_short=5.
        second land: (4,3):
            candidate_ij = 4 * min(3, 5) = 4*3 = 12 -> candidate_two=12.
        Then candidate_one=25 -> 25/2=12.5 >= 12 -> output 12.5 -> "12.5"

    But the sample output is 12.5.

 Sample Input #2:
        2
        2 5
        4 3

    Normalize:
        land1: (5,2) -> (5,2)
        land2: (4,3) -> (4,3)
        candidate_one = max(5*2, 4*3) = max(10,12)=12.

    Sort by long_i descending: [(5,2), (4,3)]

    Traverse:
        first land: (5,2): skip candidate_ij, then set max_short=2.
        second land: (4,3): candidate_ij = 4 * min(3,2)=4*2=8 -> candidate_two=8.

    Then candidate_one/2 = 12/2=6.0, and candidate_two=8.0 -> 8.0>6.0 -> output "8.0"

    Matches sample.

 Sample Input #3:
        3
        10 1
        9 8
        7 6

    Normalize:
        (10,1) -> (10,1)
        (9,8) -> (9,8)
        (7,6) -> (7,6)

    candidate_one = max(10*1, 9*8, 7*6) = max(10,72,42)=72.

    Sort: [(10,1), (9,8), (7,6)]

    Traverse:
        (10,1): skip candidate_ij, set max_short=1.
        (9,8): candidate_ij = 9 * min(8,1) = 9*1=9 -> candidate_two=9, then set max_short= max(1,8)=8.
        (7,6): candidate_ij = 7 * min(6,8)=7*6=42 -> candidate_two = max(9,42)=42.

    Then candidate_one/2 = 72/2=36.0, candidate_two=42 -> 42>36 -> output "42.0"

    Matches sample.

 27. However, note: in sample input #3, we are building two buildings of 7x6, one on the second land (9,8) and one on the third land (7,6). 
        For the second land (9,8): building 7x6: 7<=9 and 6<=8 -> fits.
        For the third land (7,6): building 7x6: 7<=7 and 6<=6 -> fits.

 28. But wait: the building 7x6: the longer side is 7 and the shorter is 6. For the second land, we can orient the building as 7 along 9 and 6 along 8? Yes. For the third land, we use the natural orientation: 7 along 7 and 6 along 6? Yes.

 29. Therefore, the code is as below.

 30. One more corner: what if the building is square? Then we don't need to worry about orientation? Our normalization and the min(short_i, max_short) still works.

 31. But note: what if we have only one land? Then candidate_two remains 0, and we output candidate_one/2.

 32. What if we have two lands but one land is very small? For example:
        2
        1 1
        100 100

        candidate_one = max(1, 10000)=10000 -> candidate_one/2=5000.
        candidate_two: 
            lands: sorted: (100,100), (1,1)
            first land: set max_short=100.
            second land: candidate_ij = 1 * min(1,100)=1 -> candidate_two=1.
        Then we output 5000.0.

        But can we build two buildings on the first land? 
            We need to check: 
                Option: two buildings on the first land: 
                    We can set building size = 100x50: 
                        Condition: 100<=100 and 50<=100 -> satisfies the first condition? 
                    Actually, we have two buildings: each 100x50? 
                        Condition: 
                            A=100, B=50: 
                            Condition 1: 100*2<=100? -> no. Condition 2: 100*2<=100? -> no. Condition 3: 100<=100 and 50*2<=100 -> 100<=100 and 100<=100 -> yes.
                    So it is possible to have two buildings of 100x50? Then the area per building is 5000.0.

        So the answer 5000.0 is correct.

 33. However, what if we have two lands and one land is too small to hold even one building? 
        Example: 
            Land1: (10,10)
            Land2: (1,1)

        candidate_one: max(100,1)=100 -> candidate_one/2=50.
        candidate_two: 
            land1: set max_short=10.
            land2: candidate_ij = 1 * min(1,10)=1 -> candidate_two=1.
        Then we output 50.0.

        But can we build two buildings on land1? 
            We want two buildings of 10x5: 
                Condition: 10<=10 and 5*2<=10 -> yes. 
            So building area per building: 10*5=50.0 -> correct.

 34. Therefore, we write the code as described.

 Let's code accordingly.
