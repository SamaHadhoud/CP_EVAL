To solve this problem, we need to determine the largest possible rectangular building size (A × B) such that two identical buildings can be constructed on available lands. The buildings can be placed either on a single land or on two different lands, considering various orientation constraints.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: 
   - **Single Land Option**: Both buildings must fit on a single land. The building dimensions must satisfy one of four conditions related to doubling one dimension of the building. The maximum building area achievable on a single land is half the area of the land (i.e., (long_i × short_i) / 2).
   - **Two Lands Option**: Each building is placed on a separate land. The building dimensions must fit within each land's dimensions in either orientation. The maximum building area is determined by the minimum of the longer sides and the minimum of the shorter sides of the two lands.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - **Normalization**: For each land, represent its dimensions as (long_i, short_i), where long_i is the maximum of the land's dimensions and short_i is the minimum. This simplifies placement conditions.
   - **Candidate Calculation**:
     - **Single Land (candidate_one)**: The maximum value of (long_i × short_i) across all lands. The building area for this option is candidate_one / 2.
     - **Two Lands (candidate_two)**: For each land, pair it with another land (processed so far) to compute the maximum possible building area. The building area is min(long_i, long_j) × min(short_i, short_j).

3. **Algorithm Selection**:
   - **Sorting**: Sort lands by long_i in descending order to efficiently process pairs.
   - **Sweeping with Tracking**: Traverse the sorted list, maintaining the maximum short_i encountered. For each land, compute the best candidate area with previously processed lands (which have long_j ≥ current long_i) using long_i × min(short_i, max_short).

4. **Complexity Analysis**:
   - **Time Complexity**: O(N log N) due to sorting. The subsequent sweep is O(N).
   - **Space Complexity**: O(N) for storing land dimensions.

### Solution Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<pair<long long, long long>> lands;
    long long candidate_one = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        long long L, W;
        cin >> L >> W;
        long long long_i = max(L, W);
        long long short_i = min(L, W);
        lands.push_back({long_i, short_i});
        candidate_one = max(candidate_one, long_i * short_i);
    }

    sort(lands.begin(), lands.end(), [](const auto& a, const auto& b) {
        return a.first > b.first;
    });

    long long candidate_two = 0;
    long long max_short = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        long long long_i = lands[i].first;
        long long short_i = lands[i].second;
        if (max_short != 0) {
            long long temp = min(short_i, max_short);
            candidate_two = max(candidate_two, long_i * temp);
        }
        if (short_i > max_short) {
            max_short = short_i;
        }
    }

    if (candidate_one >= 2 * candidate_two) {
        long long half = candidate_one / 2;
        if (candidate_one % 2 == 0) {
            cout << half << ".0\n";
        } else {
            cout << half << ".5\n";
        }
    } else {
        cout << candidate_two << ".0\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into land dimensions. Each land is normalized to (long_i, short_i) for easier processing.
2. **Single Land Calculation (candidate_one)**: The maximum product (long_i × short_i) across all lands is stored. This represents the largest building area possible on a single land (when halved).
3. **Two Lands Calculation (candidate_two)**:
   - **Sorting**: Lands are sorted by long_i in descending order to process larger lands first.
   - **Sweeping**: For each land, the algorithm checks all previously processed lands (with long_j ≥ current long_i) to compute the best possible building area (long_i × min(short_i, max_short)). The maximum short_i encountered (max_short) is maintained for efficient computation.
4. **Result Determination**: The result is derived by comparing candidate_one and 2 × candidate_two:
   - If candidate_one is larger, it is halved and printed as either an integer (with ".0") or a half-integer (with ".5").
   - Otherwise, candidate_two is printed as an integer (with ".0").

This approach efficiently handles both placement options and leverages sorting and sweeping to maximize the building area within feasible constraints.
