 We are given R, C, Q and a grid of R x C, and Q strings.
 Constraints: R, C <= 500, Q up to 200,000, but total length of all Q strings <= 200,000.

 The problem: count the number of tuples (r, c, Δr, Δc) such that:
   - We start at (r, c), move right for i steps (so to (r, c+i)), then move down for j steps (to (r+j, c+i)).
   - The string formed is the horizontal segment (from (r,c) to (r, c+i)) and then the vertical segment (from (r+1, c+i) to (r+j, c+i)) [note: the vertical part starts at the next row so that the first character in the vertical part is at (r+1, c+i)].

 However, note that the sample: 
     3x3 grid: 
        ABC
        BCD
        DAB
     Query "ABC": 
        Option 1: start at (1,1): 
          Horizontal: i=2 -> "ABC" (but then we don't move down -> so the entire horizontal segment is "ABC", and no vertical) -> this is (r=1, c=1, Δr=0, Δc=2) -> so the string is grid[0][0..2] = "ABC".
        Option 2: start at (1,1): 
          Horizontal: i=0 -> just "A", then vertical: j=2 -> from (2,1) to (3,1) -> "BC" -> so the string is "A" + "BC" = "ABC". This is (r=1, c=1, Δr=2, Δc=0) -> but note: the vertical part starts at (r+1, c+i) = (2,1) and goes to (3,1). However, note that the problem says: 
          S = G_{r,c} G_{r,c+1} ... G_{r,c+Δc} G_{r+1,c+Δc} ... G_{r+Δr,c+Δc}
          In the second case: 
            Δc = 0, so we have G_{1,1} (which is 'A') and then the vertical part: from (2,1) to (3,1): which are 'B' and 'C'. So that is "ABC".

 But note: the problem states that we go right 0 or more times and then down 0 or more times. So the entire string can be:
   - Only horizontal: then Δr = 0 and Δc = L-1 (if the string has length L).
   - Only vertical: then Δc = 0 and Δr = L-1.
   - Both: then we have a horizontal segment of length i+1 (from index0 to index i) and then a vertical segment of length j (from index i+1 to index L-1) -> note the vertical segment has j characters, and j = L - i - 1.

 Therefore, for a string S of length L, we can split at index i (0 <= i < L) meaning:
   - The horizontal part is S[0:i+1] (length = i+1)
   - The vertical part is S[i+1:L] (length = L - i - 1)

 However, note that the vertical part starts at (r+1, c+i) and goes to (r+ (L-i-1), c+i). Therefore, the starting row r must be in [0, R - (L-i) ] and the starting column c must be in [0, C - (i+1)]? Actually, the starting column for the horizontal part is c, so the horizontal part goes from c to c+i (so we require c+i <= C-1 -> c <= C-1 - i). For the vertical part: we start at (r+1, c+i) and we go down for (L-i-1) steps, so the last row is r + (L-i-1) which must be <= R-1 -> r <= R-1 - (L-i-1) = R - (L-i).

 But note: we can also have the entire string as horizontal? That is when i = L-1 and then the vertical part is of length 0 -> then the constraint for r: r <= R-1 (which is always true) and for c: c <= C-1 - (L-1) -> so we require c <= C-L.

 Similarly, the entire string as vertical: then i = -1? But note our split: the horizontal part is 0 characters and the vertical part is the entire string. How do we represent that? We can also consider splitting at i = -1? But in the problem we have the horizontal part first (which can be 0 or more) and then the vertical part (which can be 0 or more). So we can have:

   Option: Let the horizontal part be of length h, and the vertical part of length v, where h>=0, v>=0 and h+v+1 = L? Actually, the entire string length is h + v, because:
        horizontal: h = i+1, and vertical: v = L - i - 1 -> so h+v = L.

   Therefore, we can let h be from 0 to L (and v = L - h). But note: if h=0, then we have no horizontal part? Then we start at (r, c) and then immediately go down? But then the first character is at (r, c) and then the next v characters are from (r+1, c) to (r+v, c). So the starting cell must have the first character, and then the vertical part of v characters.

   However, note the problem: "going right 0 or more times, and then going down 0 or more times". So the horizontal part can be zero: then we start at (r, c) and then we move down without moving right. So the entire string is the vertical part.

   How do we include the case h=0? We can let i = -1? Instead, we can let the horizontal part length h = i+1, and i from -1 to L-1? But we are indexing the string.

   Alternatively, we can split the string S into two parts: 
        horizontal: S[0:h] (h from 0 to L) and vertical: S[h:L] (which has length L-h).

   But note: when h=0, the horizontal part is empty, and the entire string is vertical. When h=L, the vertical part is empty.

   However, the problem states: the string is constructed by starting at (r,c), going right 0 or more (so we have the horizontal segment: from (r,c) to (r, c+h-1) for h>=1, or if h=0 then we don't go right) and then going down 0 or more (so from (r+1, c+h-1) to (r+v, c+h-1) for v>=1, but note: if we didn't go right then the starting point for vertical is (r+1, c) because h=0 -> so the horizontal part ended at (r, c-1) ??? That doesn't make sense.

   Actually, the problem says: 
        S = G_{r,c} G_{r,c+1} ... G_{r,c+Δc} G_{r+1,c+Δc} ... G_{r+Δr,c+Δc}

   So the horizontal part is from (r,c) to (r, c+Δc) -> that's Δc+1 characters? Then the vertical part is from (r+1, c+Δc) to (r+Δr, c+Δc) -> that's Δr characters? So total length = Δc+1 + Δr.

   Therefore, if we let:
        h = Δc+1   [the horizontal segment has length h, so h>=1? but note: we can have Δc=0 then h=1 -> at least one character? But what if we don't move right? Then Δc=0 -> we have one character in the horizontal part? Then we move down: from (r+1, c) to (r+Δr, c) -> that's Δr characters.

   However, note: we can also not move down? Then the entire string is the horizontal segment. Then Δr=0 -> then the string is from (r,c) to (r, c+Δc) -> length = Δc+1.

   Therefore, the entire string length L = (Δc+1) + (Δr)  [because the vertical part has Δr characters].

   But wait: the first character is at (r,c). Then the horizontal part: we move right Δc times: so we get Δc+1 characters. Then we move down Δr times: but the first row of the vertical part is the next row, so we get Δr characters. So total L = (Δc+1) + Δr.

   How does that split the string? 
        The first h = Δc+1 characters are the horizontal part.
        The next v = Δr characters are the vertical part.

   So we can split the string S at position i = h-1 (0-indexed) meaning the horizontal part is S[0:h] and the vertical part is S[h:L] (which is of length v = L - h).

   Therefore, for a fixed split: 
        h in the range [1, L] and then v = L - h? 
        But note: we can also have the entire string as the horizontal part? Then v=0 -> then h = L. 
        And the entire string as the vertical part? Then h=0? But according to the problem, we always start at a cell (r,c) and that is the first character. Then we go right 0 or more -> that horizontal part must include at least the first character? So h>=1? 

   However, what if the entire string is only one character? Then we don't move right and don't move down -> that is represented by h=1 and v=0.

   How do we represent a vertical only string? 
        For example: "A" -> we can do h=1 and v=0 -> that's the one character at (r,c). 
        But what if we have a string of two characters that is entirely vertical? 
            Example: "AB" -> then we start at (r,c): we don't move right (so h=1: we take the character at (r,c)=A) and then we move down one step: from (r+1,c) to (r+1,c) -> which is B. So we have h=1 and v=1.

        However, we cannot represent a vertical only string without the starting cell? The starting cell is always the first character and that is included in the horizontal part? So the horizontal part always has at least one character.

   Therefore, we do not have the possibility of h=0. So we split the string at positions i from 0 to L-1: 
        horizontal part: S[0:i+1] (so length = i+1, and i from 0 to L-1) and then the vertical part: S[i+1:L] (length = L - i - 1).

   But note: the entire string as horizontal: then i = L-1, and vertical part is empty -> then we require the horizontal part of length L, and the vertical part of length 0.

   The entire string as vertical? Actually, we cannot have the entire string as vertical without the first character being in the horizontal part? The problem states: we start at (r,c) and then we move down: the first character is at (r,c) and then the next is at (r+1,c). So the entire string as vertical would have the first character at (r,c) and then the rest below? But that is the same as having the horizontal part of length 1 and then the vertical part of length L-1? 

   However, note: the problem says: we go right 0 or more and then down 0 or more. So we can have a path that never moves right: then the entire path is a vertical segment? But the first character is at (r,c) and then we move down: so the string is S0 = grid[r][c], then S1 = grid[r+1][c], ... -> so the horizontal part is the starting cell only? Then the horizontal part has length 1? And the vertical part is the rest? 

   Therefore, we cannot represent a string that is entirely vertical without including the starting cell as the horizontal part of length 1? So what if the string has only one character? Then we have two representations?
        - Entirely horizontal: h=1, v=0 -> then we don't move down.
        - Entirely vertical? Actually, we can also represent it as h=1 and v=0? because we don't move down? 

   But note: we can also not move right? Then we start at (r,c) and then we don't move down -> so that is the same as the horizontal representation? 

   Actually, the two representations for a single character are the same: we start at (r,c) and then we move right 0 times and down 0 times. So we count the starting cell once.

   However, what about two characters? 
        We can have:
          Option1: h=2, v=0: then we move right once -> then the string is grid[r][c] and grid[r][c+1].
          Option2: h=1, v=1: then we start at (r,c) -> then we move down once: so the string is grid[r][c] and grid[r+1][c].

        And if we have a two character string that is entirely vertical? Then we represent it as h=1 and v=1.

        But note: we cannot represent a two character string with h=0? So we are missing nothing.

   Therefore, we can iterate over splits i from 0 to L-1? But wait: what if the string is empty? The problem says the string has positive length. So we are safe.

   However, note: we can have a string of length 1: then we must consider i=0: 
        horizontal: S[0:1] -> that is the entire string, and then vertical part: empty -> so we look for a horizontal segment of length 1 and then no vertical. 
        Also we can consider i=-1? That would be horizontal part of length 0? But we don't allow that.

   Actually, we must have the horizontal part at least one character. Therefore, we consider splits at i in [0, L-1] meaning the horizontal part is the prefix of length i+1 and the vertical part is the suffix of length L-i-1.

   But note: the vertical part can be zero? Then i = L-1: horizontal part is the entire string, and vertical part is empty.

   How about the constraints on the grid?
        For a split i (so horizontal part of length h = i+1, vertical part of length v = L - i - 1), we require:
          - The starting column c must satisfy: c + h - 1 < C -> c <= C - h = C - (i+1)
          - The starting row r must satisfy: 
                The horizontal part is in row r -> so r must be in [0, R-1] (always valid for the horizontal part? because we are only moving right in that row) 
                Then the vertical part: we start at (r+1, c+i) and go down for v steps -> so we require: r+1 + v - 1 <= R-1  -> r + v <= R-1 -> r <= R-1 - v = R-1 - (L-i-1) = R - (L-i)

        Therefore, the starting row r must be in [0, R - (L-i) - 1]? Actually, the last row of the vertical part is r+v = r + (L-i-1) and we require that to be at most R-1 -> so r <= R-1 - (L-i-1) = R - (L-i).

        Also note: we can have v=0 -> then the constraint on r is r <= R-0 -> so all rows.

   So for a fixed split i, we iterate:
        r from 0 to R - (L-i) [if L-i-1>0 then R-(L-i) is the maximum r, but if v=0 then r can go from 0 to R-1] -> so we set:
             max_r = (v==0) ? R-1 : R - (L-i) - 1? Actually, note: we defined R as the number of rows, and our grid rows are 0-indexed [0, R-1]. 
             The condition: r + (L-i-1) <= R-1  -> r <= R-1 - (L-i-1) = R - (L-i) -> but note: R - (L-i) might be negative? Then we skip.

        Similarly, for c: we require c <= C-1 - i -> because the horizontal segment goes from c to c+i (i+1 characters) -> so c in [0, C-1-i].

   How to check the grid segment? We can precompute row-wise and column-wise hashes.

   Steps:
        Precomputation:
          - Precompute base powers (for hashing) up to max_len = max(R, C) (or maybe max(R,C) and also up to 200000? but note the total length of all queries is 200000, but the grid is only 500x500 -> so we need up to 500? Actually, the horizontal segment can be at most C, and vertical at most R. But the query string can be up to 200000? However, we are going to skip any query with L>R+C-1, so the maximum segment we need to compare in the grid is at most max(R,C) which is 500. But we also need to compute the hash for the query string which can be long? However, the total length of all queries is 200000, so we can compute the hash for each query string.

        Precomputation for grid:
          - For each row, precompute the prefix hash for that row.
          - For each column, precompute the prefix hash for that column.

        For each query string S of length L:
          Step 1: if L > R+C-1, output 0 (because the maximum path length: starting at (r,c) and going right at most C-1 and then down at most R-1 -> total length = (C-1) + (R) [because the starting cell is shared] -> R+C-1? Actually: 
                  horizontal: up to C characters (if we go from c to c+C-1 -> that's C characters) and then vertical: we can have R-1 characters? so total = C + (R-1) = R+C-1. But note: the starting cell is counted in the horizontal part? So the entire path has at most R+C-1 characters? Yes.

          Step 2: Precompute the hash for the entire query string S (using the same base and modulus).

          Step 3: For each possible split i from max(0, L-R) to min(L-1, C-1) [because the horizontal part length is i+1, which must be at most C -> i<=C-1, and the vertical part length is L-i-1, which must be at most R-1 -> L-i-1 <= R-1 -> i>= L-R]? Actually: 
                vertical part length = L-i-1 <= R-1? -> i >= L - R.
                horizontal part length = i+1 <= C -> i <= C-1.

          Step 4: For each split i in [i0, i1] (where i0 = max(0, L-R) and i1 = min(L-1, C-1)):
                horizontal segment in the grid: we need to check that the horizontal part of the query (S[0:i+1]) matches a horizontal segment in the grid starting at (r, c) and of length i+1.
                vertical segment: then we need to check that the vertical part (S[i+1:L]) matches the vertical segment starting at (r+1, c+i) and of length L-i-1.

          Step 5: How to avoid iterating over every possible (r,c) in the grid? The grid is 500x500 -> 250000 cells. And the splits are at most min(L, C) - max(0, L-R) which in worst-case L=100, R=500, C=500 -> about 100 splits. Then for each split we iterate over r in [0, R-(L-i)] and c in [0, C-1-i]? The total number of cells per split is about (R - (L-i)) * (C - i) which in worst-case (when L-i is small) is about R * C -> 250000. And 100 * 250000 = 25e6 which might be borderline in C++ in 5 seconds? But worst-case total over all queries? The total length of all query strings is 200000, but note: the splits we do per query: the number of splits per query is (i1 - i0 + 1) which is at most min(L, C) - max(0, L-R) + 1. 

          However, note: the constraints on L: the total length of all queries is 200000, so the worst-case for a single query is 200000? Then the splits for that query: i0 = max(0, L-R) and i1 = min(L-1, C-1). Since R and C are at most 500, then:
                i0 = max(0, L-500) and i1 = min(L-1, 499). 
                The number of splits = min(L-1,499) - max(0, L-500) + 1.

          For L <= 500: 
                i0 = 0, i1 = L-1 -> splits: L, which is <=500.
          For L > 500:
                i0 = L-500, i1 = 499 -> so the number of splits = 499 - (L-500) + 1 = 1000 - L? 
                But if L>500, then L-500>0, and we require L-500 <= 499? -> L <= 999. 
                Actually: the condition for i0: we require i0 = L-500, and we also require i0<=i1 -> L-500 <= 499 -> L<=999.

          However, we skipped any L>R+C-1 = 500+500-1=999? So for L>999 we skip. For L in [501,999]: the number of splits = 499 - (L-500) + 1 = 1000 - L. 
          So the maximum splits for a query is 500 (for L<=500) or 1000-L (for L in [501,999]) which is at most 500.

          Therefore, per query we have at most 500 splits. Then for each split we iterate over at most (R - (L-i)) * (C - i) cells. 
          Worst-case: when L-i is as small as possible? 
                For a fixed L, and i in [i0, i1], the worst-case for the grid iteration is when (R - (L-i)) is large and (C-i) is large. 
                For example: when i is small -> then (C-i) is large (close to C) and (R - (L-i)) might be R - (L - i) = R - L + i. Since i is small, that might be negative? Then we skip. 

          Actually, we skip if R - (L-i) < 0? We have the condition: for a split i, we require r from 0 to R - (L-i) [if R-(L-i) is negative, we skip the split? But we already bounded i by i0 = max(0, L-R) so that L-i <= R? -> then R - (L-i) >= 0. 

          Therefore, the number of rows r: from 0 to R - (L-i) (inclusive) -> that's (R - (L-i) + 1) rows? 
          The number of columns c: from 0 to C-1-i -> that's (C - i) columns.

          Then the total for a split i: (R - (L-i) + 1) * (C - i).

          What is the worst-case? 
                Let L = 500, and i=0: then rows: R - 500 + 0 + 1? = R - 499 -> but if R=500, then 1 row. And columns: C. So 1 * 500 = 500.
                Let L=500, and i=499: then rows: R - (500-499) = R-1 -> 499 rows? and columns: C-499 -> 1 column. So 499*1 = 499.

          Now consider L=1000? -> we skip because L>R+C-1.

          But note: the maximum L we consider is 999. For L=999 and i=499: 
                rows: R - (999 - 499) = 500 - 500 = 0 -> then 1 row? Actually: r in [0, 0] -> 1 row? 
                columns: C-499 = 1 -> so 1*1 = 1.

          For L=999 and i=0: 
                rows: R - (999 - 0) = 500 - 999 -> negative? but we bounded i>= L-R = 999-500=499. So i0=499. So we only do i from 499 to 499.

          Therefore, the worst-case for a split is when i is in the middle? Actually, the product (R - (L-i) + 1) * (C - i) is bounded by R*C which is 250000 per split? But note: the values of i we consider are at the extremes? 

          Actually, we can compute the total over all splits for a fixed L:
                Total work = sum_{i=i0}^{i1} [ (R - (L-i) + 1) * (C - i) ]

          We can break it: 
                = sum_{i} [ (R - L + i + 1) * (C - i) ]
                = sum_{i} [ (a + i) * (b - i) ]   where a = R-L+1, b = C.

          But note: the range of i is from i0 to i1, which is about 500 values? Then we can iterate without worry? 

          However, worst-case total over all queries? 
                The total length of all queries is 200000. But the number of queries is up to 200000? And each query we do at most 500 splits? And for each split we do a double loop? The inner double loop would be the product (number of rows) * (number of columns) per split. 

          But note: the worst-case per split is 250000 (when R - (L-i) + 1 = R and C-i = C -> but that only happens when L-i is 0? and i=C-1? and then R - L + i+1 = R - L + C -> which might be negative? Actually, we have bounded i such that R - (L-i) >=0, so the product is at most (R) * (C) = 250000.

          Then worst-case per query: 500 splits * 250000 = 125e6 per query? 
          And we have up to 200000 queries? -> 200000 * 125e6 = 25e12 which is too high.

          We must optimize.

   Alternative approach for a fixed split i and query S:
        We want to count the number of (r, c) such that:
            (1) 0 <= r <= R - (L-i) 
            (2) 0 <= c <= C-1-i 
            (3) The horizontal segment: grid[r][c ... c+i] equals S[0:i+1]
            (4) The vertical segment: grid[r+1 ... r+(L-i-1)][c+i] equals S[i+1:L]

        How to check condition (3) and (4) without iterating over every (r,c)? We can precompute the row hashes and column hashes and then check by hashes.

        We can precompute:
            H_row[r][c1..c2] = hash for grid[r] from c1 to c2.
            H_col[c][r1..r2] = hash for column c from r1 to r2.

        Then for a fixed (r, c) and split i:
            Condition (3): 
                H_row[r] from c to c+i: 
                    = H_row[r][c+i+1] - H_row[r][c] * pow_base[i+1]
                We compare this to the hash for S[0:i+1] (which we precomputed for the query: let H_S1 = H_S[i+1] - H_S[0]*pow_base[i+1]? Actually, we precomputed H_S for the entire string: H_S[0]=0, H_S[1] = S0, H_S[2] = S0*131+S1, ... so the hash for S[0:i+1] is H_S[i+1].

            Condition (4):
                The vertical segment: from row r+1 to r+(L-i-1) in column c+i.
                The hash for this segment: 
                    = H_col[c+i][r+1 + (L-i-1)] - H_col[c+i][r+1] * pow_base[L-i-1]   [if we stored the column hash as prefix from row0 to row?]
                But our H_col[col] is defined for the entire column: 
                    H_col[col][r'] for r' from 0 to R (inclusive). 
                Then the segment from r1 to r2 (inclusive) has length = r2 - r1 + 1? 
                    Actually, we want from row r+1 to row r+(L-i-1) (inclusive) -> that's (L-i-1) characters? 
                    The starting index is r+1, and the ending index is r+(L-i-1) -> so the last row is r+(L-i-1). 
                    Then the hash is: 
                         H_col[col][r+(L-i-1)+1] - H_col[col][r+1] * pow_base[L-i-1]

                And we compare to the hash for S[i+1:L]: 
                    We have the entire string hash: H_S[L] - H_S[i+1] * pow_base[L-i-1]? 
                    But note: our hash for the query: 
                         H_S[k] = H_S[k-1]*131 + (S[k-1]-'A'+1)   [if we built it from 0-indexed?]
                    Then the hash for S[i+1:L] = H_S[L] - H_S[i+1] * pow_base[L-i-1]? 
                         Actually: 
                         H_S[L] = H_S[i+1] * pow_base[L-i-1] + H_rest, so H_rest = H_S[L] - H_S[i+1] * pow_base[L-i-1]? 

                But note: we precomputed the entire string S in an array H_S[0..L] where:
                         H_S[0] = 0
                         H_S[1] = s0
                         H_S[2] = s0*131 + s1
                         ...
                         H_S[L] = ... 

                Then the hash for S[i+1:L] = the substring starting at index i+1 of length L-i-1? 
                         = H_S[L] - H_S[i+1] * pow_base[L-i-1]

        Therefore, for a fixed split i, we can precompute:
            hash_horiz = H_S[i+1]   [because H_S[i+1] is the hash for S[0..i] (i+1 characters)? Actually, H_S[i+1] is the hash for the first i+1 characters? Yes.

            hash_vert = H_S[L] - H_S[i+1] * pow_base[L-i-1]   [for the part S[i+1:L]].

        Then we want to count the number of (r, c) in the ranges such that:
            (a) H_row[r][c+i+1] - H_row[r][c] * pow_base[i+1] == hash_horiz
            (b) If L-i-1>0: 
                   H_col[c+i][r+L-i] - H_col[c+i][r+1] * pow_base[L-i-1] == hash_vert
                If L-i-1==0, then condition (b) is automatically satisfied.

        Now, how to avoid iterating over every (r,c)? We note that the constraints on r and c are independent? But the condition (a) is per row and per starting column? 

        We can precompute for each row the starting columns that satisfy the horizontal condition? Then for each row, we can store the columns c that satisfy the horizontal condition for that row and that split i? Then for each row, we can iterate over those columns and then check the vertical condition? 

        But note: we are iterating over splits i per query. And we are iterating over rows r in [0, R-(L-i)] for each split.

        For a fixed split i and row r, we want to count the columns c in [0, C-1-i] such that:
            H_row[r][c+i+1] - H_row[r][c] * pow_base[i+1] == hash_horiz   ... (a)

        And then for each such (r,c) we also need to check the vertical condition? 

        But note: the vertical condition depends on r and c (via the column index = c+i and the starting row r+1) and the vertical part length = L-i-1.

        However, for a fixed row r and split i, the vertical condition for a column c (which determines the column index = c+i) and the row range [r+1, r+L-i-1] is independent of c? Actually, it depends on c only through the column index? And we have c+i? So if we let d = c+i, then d must be in [i, C-1]? Actually, c in [0, C-1-i] -> then d = c+i in [i, C-1].

        How to count without iterating? 
          For a fixed split i and row r, we can precompute the set of columns c that satisfy condition (a). Then for each such c, we check condition (b) by looking at the column d = c+i and the segment [r+1, r+L-i-1] in that column.

        But note: the total over all rows and splits might be heavy: worst-case for a split i, the number of rows is R - (L-i) (which is at least 1) and for each row we iterate over C-i columns? Then we are back to (R - (L-i)) * (C-i) per split.

        And we have at most 500 splits per query? Then worst-case total per query: 500 * (500*500) = 500 * 250000 = 125e6 per query? and then 200000 queries? -> 25e12 operations -> too slow.

        We need a better idea.

   Alternative: Precomputation for the entire grid? But we have Q up to 200000.

   How about: for each possible split i and for each row r and each column c, we cannot avoid iterating? 

   But note: the constraints: R, C <= 500 -> the grid has 250000 cells. The total work per query: 500 splits * (number of rows * number of columns per split) -> worst-case per split: (number of rows) * (number of columns) = (R) * (C) = 250000? Then per query: 500 * 250000 = 125e6 per query? 
   Then worst-case total over all queries: 200000 * 125e6 = 25e12 -> which is 25e12 operations -> too high.

   We must note: the total length of all queries is 200000, but the total work per query depends on the length L? Actually, the number of splits per query is at most 500, but the inner loop is O(R * C) per split? Then worst-case per query: 500 * 250000 = 125e6. And if we have 200000 queries, worst-case total operations: 200000 * 125e6 = 25e12 -> too high.

   We need to optimize the inner double loop.

   Idea: Precompute for each row r and each possible horizontal length h (from 1 to C) the hash of the segment starting at c? We can do that already: we have H_row[r] for the entire row. Similarly for columns.

   Then for a fixed split i and fixed row r, we want to count the columns c in [0, C-1-i] such that the horizontal hash for row r, from c to c+i, equals hash_horiz. We can precompute nothing for the entire grid for all queries? But note: the query string changes per query.

   However, we can do: for a fixed row r and split i (so horizontal segment length h = i+1), we want to quickly get all columns c such that:
        H_row[r][c+i+1] - H_row[r][c] * pow_base[i+1] == X   (where X = hash_horiz)

   And similarly, for the vertical part: for a fixed column d and fixed starting row r0 (which is r+1) and length v = L-i-1, we want to check:
        H_col[d][r0+v] - H_col[d][r0] * pow_base[v] == Y   (where Y = hash_vert)

   But note: we are iterating over r and then c. How to avoid iterating over every c?

   We can precompute for each row r and for each length h (from 1 to C) a mapping from hash value to the list of columns c that have that hash? But that would be O(C) per row and there are R rows -> 500*500 = 250000, and we do it for each length h? There are C lengths -> 500*250000 = 125e6 per query? -> too heavy.

   Alternatively, we can iterate over the columns c for a fixed row r and split i, but we break early if the horizontal part doesn't match? We compute the horizontal hash for (r, c) and compare to hash_horiz. That is O(1) per c. Then for the vertical part, we compute the vertical hash and compare? That is O(1) per (r,c).

   Then per split i, the work is (number of rows) * (number of columns) = (R - (L-i)) * (C - i). 

   And we do this for each split i in the set of splits for the query.

   How bad is that? 
        The worst-case for a query: 
            splits: i in [i0, i1] -> at most 500 splits.
            per split: (R - (L-i)) * (C - i) -> worst-case for a split: when L-i is minimized and i is minimized? 
                Actually, we want the maximum value of (R - (L-i)) * (C-i) over i in [i0, i1].

        Since R and C are 500, the maximum product is 500*500=250000 per split.

        Then worst-case per query: 500 * 250000 = 125e6.

        How many queries? The total length of all queries is 200000, but note: the total number of queries is 200000? And 200000 * 125e6 = 25e12 operations -> which is too high.

   But wait: the total length of all queries is 200000, meaning the sum of |S| over queries is 200000. How does that relate to the number of queries? 
        The problem: "The next Q lines each contains a string S ... The sum of the length of all Q strings combined is not more than 200,000."

        So Q can be up to 200000, but the total length is 200000 -> that means most queries are very short. 

        Specifically, the average length is 200000/200000 = 1.

        Therefore, the worst-case length of a query is 200000? But we skip any query with L>R+C-1=999, so the maximum L we process is 999. And the total length is 200000, so the maximum number of queries that have L>=500? might be limited.

        However, worst-case: we could have one query with L=999 and 199999 queries with L=1? 
            Then the total length = 999 + 199999 = 200998 -> acceptable.

        For the one query with L=999: the work is 125e6 (which is acceptable in C++ in 5 seconds? 125e6 operations might be around 1 second?).

        For the 199999 queries with L=1: 
            For a query of length 1: 
                splits: i0 = max(0, 1-R) = 0, i1 = min(0, C-1)=0 -> only one split: i=0.
                Then per split: 
                    rows: r from 0 to R - (1-0) = R-1 (which is 499) -> 500 rows? [if R=500, then r from 0 to 499 -> 500 rows]
                    columns: c from 0 to C-1-0 = C-1 -> 500 columns.
                Then the work for the split: 500*500 = 250000.

                Then the total for 199999 queries: 199999 * 250000 = 49999750000 -> about 50e9 -> too high.

        Therefore, we need to optimize the short queries.

   How to optimize? 
        We note that for a query of length 1: 
            We are counting every cell (r, c) such that grid[r][c] == S[0]. 
            We can precompute a global frequency of each letter? But note: we don't care about the letter? We care about the count.

        But wait: the answer for a query "A" is the number of cells that have 'A'. 
            We can precompute an array: 
                countChar[char] = number of cells with that char.

            Then for a query of length 1: output countChar[S[0]].

        Similarly, we can handle queries of length 1 separately.

        What about length 2? 
            We have two splits: i=0 and i=1? 
            But note: i from 0 to 1? Actually, the splits for L=2: 
                i0 = max(0, 2-R) and i1 = min(1, C-1). 
                Since R>=1, 2-R<=1 -> i0 = max(0,2-R). If R>=2, then i0=0. 
                Then splits: i=0 and i=1? 
            For i=0: 
                horizontal part: S[0:1] (1 char) and vertical part: S[1:2] (1 char).
                Conditions: 
                   r in [0, R- (2-0)] = [0, R-2] (if R>=2) 
                   c in [0, C-1]
                Then for each (r,c) we check:
                   (r,c): char must be S[0]
                   then (r+1, c): char must be S[1] -> so we are counting the number of (r,c) such that grid[r][c]==S[0] and grid[r+1][c]==S[1] and r in [0,R-2].

            For i=1: 
                horizontal part: S[0:2] (2 chars) -> then we require c in [0, C-2] and r in [0, R- (2-1)] = [0, R-1] (which is all rows) 
                Condition: the horizontal segment of length 2: grid[r][c] and grid[r][c+1] must be S[0] and S[1].

            So we are counting:
                i=0: count1 = number of (r,c) in [0,R-2] x [0,C-1] such that grid[r][c]==S[0] and grid[r+1][c]==S[1].
                i=1: count2 = number of (r,c) in [0,R-1] x [0,C-2] such that grid[r][c]==S[0] and grid[r][c+1]==S[1].

            Then total = count1 + count2.

        We can precompute:
            For vertical adjacent pairs: 
                vert_count[a][b] = number of r from 0 to R-2 and any c such that grid[r][c]=a and grid[r+1][c]=b.

            For horizontal adjacent pairs:
                hor_count[a][b] = number of c from 0 to C-2 and any r such that grid[r][c]=a and grid[r][c+1]=b.

        Then for a query of length 2: 
            if the string is "AB", then 
                count1 = vert_count['A']['B'] 
                count2 = hor_count['A']['B']
                total = count1+count2.

        Similarly, we can precompute for all adjacent pairs.

        But what about longer strings? The total length is 200000, so the maximum length of a string that we process is 999, but the majority are short. 

        We can do: 
          Precomputation for short strings? But note: the total length of all queries is 200000, and the maximum length is 999, but the frequency of long strings might be low.

        How about: 
          Precompute answers for all strings of length 1 and 2? 
          For strings of length>=3, use the double loop over splits? 

        But note: the worst-case for a query of length 3: 
            splits: i0 = max(0,3-R), i1 = min(2, C-1). 
            For R>=3: i0=0, i1 = min(2,499)=2 -> 3 splits.
            Per split: 
                For i=0: 
                   r in [0, R-3] -> 500-3 = 497 rows? and c in [0, C-1] -> 500 columns -> 497*500 = 248500.
                For i=1: 
                   r in [0, R-2] -> 498 rows, c in [0, C-2] -> 498 columns? -> 498*498 = 248004.
                For i=2:
                   r in [0, R-1] -> 500 rows, c in [0, C-3] -> 497 columns -> 500*497 = 248500.
            Total work: 248500+248004+248500 = ~745000 per query.

        And if we have 1000 queries of length 3: then 1000*745000 = 745e6 -> acceptable.

        But if we have 1000 queries of length 500: 
            splits: i0 = max(0,500-R)=max(0,500-500)=0, i1 = min(499,499)=499 -> 500 splits.
            Per split: 
                The work per split: (R - (500-i)) * (C - i) 
                For i=0: (500-500)*500 = 0 -> skip? because R-(500-0)=500-500=0 -> then the number of rows is 1? (r from 0 to 0) and columns 500 -> 1*500=500.
                For i=1: (500- (500-1)) = 1 row, and columns 499 -> 1*499=499.
                ...
                For i=499: (500 - (500-499)) = 500-1=499 rows, and columns 1 -> 499.

            Total work per query: sum_{i=0}^{499} (500-i) = 500+499+...+1 = 125250.

            Then 1000 queries: 1000 * 125250 = 125.25e6 -> acceptable.

        The worst-case is when the string length is around 1 or 2? But we are handling 1 and 2 by precomputation? 

        Actually, we are not handling 1 and 2 by precomputation in the above double loop? We can do:

          For queries with L=1: use a precomputed count for each char.
          For queries with L=2: use precomputed counts for adjacent pairs (both vertically and horizontally).

          For L>=3: use the double loop over splits.

        How many queries of length>=3? 
            The total length of all queries is 200000.
            Let n1 = number of queries of length 1, n2 = number of queries of length 2, n3 = number of queries of length>=3.
            Then: n1 + n2 + n3 = Q, and 1*n1 + 2*n2 + (lengths of the rest) = 200000.

            The worst-case for n3: 
                We want to maximize the work for n3, which is the sum_{query of length L>=3} [ (number of splits) * (max work per split) ]

            But note: the work per query of length L>=3: 
                number of splits = min(L-1, C-1) - max(0, L-R) + 1 <= min(L,500) - max(0, L-500) + 1.
                and the work per split is at most (R) * (C) = 250000.

            And the total work for n3: <= (number of queries in n3) * (500) * (250000) = n3 * 125e6.

            But n3 is bounded by 200000, so worst-case 200000 * 125e6 = 25e12 -> too high.

        However, note: the total length of all queries is 200000, so the sum of L for all queries is 200000.

        Therefore, the maximum number of queries of length>=3 is 200000/3 = about 66666.

        And the worst-case work per query of length L: 
            splits: at most 500 per query.
            work per split: at most 250000.

            Then total work for n3: <= 66666 * 500 * 250000 = 8.3325e12 -> too high.

        We need to optimize further.

   Let's reexamine the double loop for a fixed split i and query S:
        We iterate r from 0 to R - (L-i) (inclusive) and c from 0 to C-1-i (inclusive). For each (r,c), we do:
            if (get_row_hash(r, c, c+i) != hash_horiz) continue;
            if (L-i-1>0) {
                if (get_col_hash(c+i, r+1, r+L-i-1) != hash_vert) continue;
            }
            then ans++.

        The worst-case per split is the number of (r,c) pairs, which is (R - (L-i)) * (C - i). 

        But note: we are already bounded by the grid size (<=250000 per split), and the number of splits per query is at most 500, so per query: 500 * 250000 = 125e6.

        And the total length of all queries is 200000, but the total work over all queries is not bounded by the total string length, but by the number of queries times the worst-case work per query.

        However, the total length of all queries is 200000, so the number of queries is at most 200000 (if all are length1). But we are handling length1 and length2 separately.

        For length>=3, the number of such queries: let T = total length of queries of length>=3, and the number of queries n3, then T >= 3*n3, and T<=200000, so n3<=66666.

        Then total work = n3 * (work per query).

        What is the worst-case work per query? We said 125e6? Then 66666 * 125e6 = 8333250000000 operations -> 8.3e12 -> which is too high.

   We must try to optimize the inner double loop by breaking early or by using a more efficient method per row.

   Idea for a fixed split i and fixed row r:
        We want to find all c in [0, C-1-i] such that:
            H_row[r][c+i+1] - H_row[r][c] * pow_base[i+1] == hash_horiz.

        This is a string matching problem in a fixed string (the row) for the pattern of length i+1. We can do KMP for each row? That would be O(C) per row. Then for one row: O(C) and for all rows: O(R*C) per split? Then per split: 500*500=250000, and per query: 500 * 250000 = 125e6 -> same as before.

   Alternatively, we can precompute a global 2D table of hashes for the grid rows? Then for a fixed row r and fixed length h = i+1, we want to know the columns c where the hash equals hash_horiz. We could store for each row r and each length h a map from hash value to frequency? But then we would need to build a map for every row and every h? That is 500 rows * 500 lengths = 250000 maps. And we would build them at the beginning. Then for a query and a split i, for each row r in the valid range, we do a lookup in the map for row r and length=i+1 to get the number of c in [0, C-1-i] that have that hash. But then we also need to do the vertical part condition? 

        For each such (r,c) we still need to check the vertical part? So we cannot avoid iterating over the columns c that passed the horizontal condition? 

        But note: if we have the list of c for a fixed (r, i) from the map, then we iterate over those c and check the vertical part. The worst-case for a row r and length i+1: there could be O(C) columns c that match? Then we are back to O(C) per row.

   Given time constraints, and the fact that the grid is only 500x500, we might hope that the worst-case 125e6 per query is acceptable in C++ if optimized well? 

        Note: 125e6 operations per query -> and we have at most 66666 queries of length>=3? then total operations 66666 * 125e6 = 8.3e12, which is too high.

   Alternatively, we note that the total work over all queries might be bounded by the total length of the query strings times a constant factor? 

        Specifically, for a query string S of length L, the work is: 
             sum_{i in splits} ( (R - (L-i)) * (C - i) )

        We can write: 
             work(S) = sum_{i=i0}^{i1} ( (R - L + i + 1) * (C - i) )

        Let f(i) = (R-L+i+1) * (C-i) = (a+i)*(b-i) = a*b + i*(b-a) - i^2, where a = R-L+1, b=C.

        This is a quadratic in i, and we are summing over i in [i0, i1]. The number of terms is about min(L, C) - max(0, L-R) + 1, which is at most 500.

        But the value of the product for one i is (R - (L-i)) * (C-i) which might be as large as 250000.

        And we do this for each query.

        But note: the total work work(S) is not the total number of operations, because we are not iterating over the product, we are iterating over r and c and the product is the number of pairs (r,c) we iterate over.

        Therefore, the total number of iterations over all queries is:
            total_work = sum_{query S} [ sum_{i in splits of S} ( (R - (L-i)) * (C - i) ) ]

        How to bound total_work? 
            The total length of all query strings is 200000.

        We can try to bound by the total length? 
            For a query string S of length L, the inner sum is bounded by 500 * 250000 = 125e6.

            And the total work over queries: sum_{S} [work(S)] <= (number of queries) * 125e6.

            But the number of queries can be up to 200000, which would yield 25e12.

        Alternatively, we can note: 
            work(S) = sum_{i} ( (R - (L-i)) * (C - i) ) 
                   <= sum_{i} (R * C) 
                   <= 500 * 250000 = 125e6 per query.

        And the number of queries of length>=3 is at most 66666, then total work <= 66666 * 125e6 = 8.3e12.

        8.3e12 operations might be borderline in C++? 
            On a typical machine, 1e9 operations per second -> 8.3e12 / 1e9 = 8300 seconds.

        This is too high.

   We must try to avoid iterating over every (r,c) in the grid for every split.

   New idea: 
        For a fixed split i, we want to count the number of (r,c) in the valid ranges such that:
            (1) The horizontal segment (r, c, i) matches the pattern P = S[0:i+1].
            (2) The vertical segment (r, c+i, L-i-1) matches the pattern Q = S[i+1:L].

        Condition (1) is: a fixed string P in row r starting at c for length i+1.
        Condition (2) is: a fixed string Q in column (c+i) starting at row r+1 for length L-i-1.

        We can precompute a 2D boolean array for the grid for the horizontal condition? But the pattern P changes per query.

        Alternatively, we can for the entire grid and for the given split i and pattern P, mark the cells (r,c) where the horizontal segment matches. Similarly for the vertical part. But then we want to count the pairs (r,c) that satisfy the horizontal condition and then the vertical condition for the column c+i.

        Specifically, let A[r][c] = 1 if the horizontal segment at (r,c) of length i+1 equals P.
        Let B[r][d] = 1 if the vertical segment in column d starting at row r+1 of length L-i-1 equals Q.

        Then we want to count:
            for r in [0, R-(L-i)] and c in [0, C-1-i]:
                if A[r][c] and B[r][c+i] then count++.

        This is a 2D counting: for each r, we want to count the number of c such that A[r][c] is true and B[r][c+i] is true.

        We can precompute for each row r an array for A[r] and B[r]? But note: the arrays A and B depend on the query and the split i.

        However, if we had A and B for the current split i, then for a fixed row r, we can use a sliding window or prefix sum on B[r] to quickly count: 
            We want to count for c in [0, C-1-i]: 
                A[r][c] and B[r][c+i] 

            = for c in [0, C-1-i]: 
                we care about B[r][c+i] only if A[r][c] is true.

            So for fixed r, let F(c) = A[r][c] and we want to sum_{c} B[r][c+i] * A[r][c] = sum_{c} [ if A[r][c] then B[r][c+i] ]

        How to compute this quickly? 
            We can precompute for each row r an array for B[r] (which is indexed by column).

        Then for a fixed row r and fixed i, we can do:
            count_row = 0;
            for c such that A[r][c] is true, then if c+i is within the bounds of the column array for B[r] and B[r][c+i] is true, then count_row++.

        But then we iterate over c in [0, C-1-i] for which A[r][c] is true. The number of true in A[r] might be O(C). And we do this for every row r. So per split i, the work is O(R*C) -> 250000.

        Then for a query: number of splits * 250000, which is 500 * 250000 = 125e6 per query -> same as before.

        Therefore, we cannot avoid O(R*C) per split.

   Given the complexity and the constraints on the total length of queries (200000) and the fact that only queries of length>=3 use this method, and the number of such queries is at most 66666, we note that 66666 * 125e6 = 8.3e12 might be too high.

   We must seek to bound the work per query in terms of L and grid size more tightly.

   Observing that the valid (r,c) for a split i might be sparse in the sense that the horizontal condition might fail for most c. We can iterate over r and then only over the c that are starts of the horizontal pattern in row r? 

        How to get the starts of the horizontal pattern in a row? -> string matching.

        For a fixed row r and fixed pattern P = S[0:i+1], we can do a KMP in the row string and find all occurrences. The length of P is i+1, and the row length is C. The number of occurrences might be O(C) in the worst-case (every c matches) -> then we are back to O(C) per row.

        Alternatively, we can use hashing to quickly check the horizontal condition for a given (r,c) in O(1), and then iterate over c in the valid range. This is what we are already doing.

   Given the time, we decide to implement the double loop and hope that in practice the grid is not adversarial.

   Alternatively, we note that the worst-case product (R - (L-i)) * (C-i) might be very small for many splits. In particular, when i is close to L-R or close to C-1, the product might be small.

   For example, when i is close to C-1, then C-i is small. When i is close to L-R, then R - (L-i) is small.

   In fact, the summation over i of (R - (L-i)) * (C-i) might be bounded by O(R*C) per query? 

        We note: 
          sum_{i} ( (R - L + i + 1) * (C - i) ) 
          = sum_{i} [ (R-L+1) * C - (R-L+1)*i + C*i - i^2 + C - i ??? ] -> let's expand: 
          = (R-L+1)*C * (number of terms) + [ - (R-L+1) + C ] * sum i - sum i^2 + ... 

        Actually, we can try to bound by the grid cell count: 
          Each grid cell (r,c) might be the starting cell for a path that uses split i such that the horizontal part length = i+1 and the vertical part length = L-i-1. 
          But note: a fixed (r,c) and a fixed split i: then the horizontal part must be in row r from c to c+i, and the vertical part in column c+i from r+1 to r+(L-i-1).

          For a fixed (r,c), how many splits i would consider this (r,c)? 
             We require:
                 i+1 = horizontal length, and c+i < C -> i < C - c.
                 and the vertical part length = L-i-1, and r+(L-i-1) < R -> L-i-1 < R - r -> i > L - (R - r) - 1.

             So i in [ max(0, L - (R-r) - 1), min(L-1, C-c-1) ].

          Therefore, the cell (r,c) is considered in a number of splits = the length of the interval [ max(0, L - (R-r) - 1), min(L-1, C-c-1) ].

          Then total work = sum_{r,c} [ number of splits that use (r,c) ]

          = sum_{r,c} [ min(L-1, C-c-1) - max(0, L - (R-r) - 1) + 1 ]  [if the interval is nonempty]

          How to bound this? 
             = (number of grid cells) * (number of splits per cell) in the worst-case might be O(R*C*L) -> which is too high.

        Alternatively, the worst-case might be O(R*C) per query? because the summation over r and c is over the grid, and the term per cell is at most O(L) -> then total work O(R*C*L) -> 500*500*1000 = 250e6 per query, and then 66666 queries -> 66666 * 250e6 = 16.665e12.

        This is similar to our previous bound.

   Given the complexity, we must hope that the worst-case does not happen.

   But note: the intended solution might be: iterate over the starting cell (r,c) and then over the split i that are valid for (r,c)? 
        for r in range(R):
          for c in range(C):
             for i in range( max(0, L - (R-r) - 1), min(L-1, C-c-1) + 1 ):
                 check if the horizontal part [r][c..c+i] equals the first i+1 chars and the vertical part [r+1..r+(L-i-1)][c+i] equals the next L-i-1 chars.

        This is O(R*C* (number of splits per cell)).

        The number of splits per cell is at most O(L) -> then total work O(R*C*L) per query -> which is 500*500*1000 = 250e6 per query.

        Then for 66666 queries: 66666 * 250e6 = 16.665e12.

   So both methods are O(R*C*(number of splits per cell)) per query.

   Given the time constraints, we implement the first double loop (over splits then over r and c) and hope that in practice the (R - (L-i)) * (C-i) is small.

   Or we try to optimize by 
        - Only iterating over the valid range for r and c.
        - Using a break if the horizontal part doesn't match (continue to next c) and similarly for vertical.

   We also note that for very short 
        For the sample: R=C=3, and a query of length 2: 
            splits: i0=0, i1=1.
            For i=0: 
                r in [0, R- (2-0)] = [0, 1] (if 0-indexed: 2-0=2, R=3, then r in [0, 3-2] = [0,1] -> 2 rows)
                c in [0, C-1-0] = [0,2] (3 columns) -> 6 iterations.
                For each (r,c), we do two hash computations.

            For i=1: 
                r in [0, R- (2-1)] = [0, 3-1] = [0,2] -> 3 rows.
                c in [0, C-1-1] = [0,1] -> 2 columns -> 6 iterations.

            total 12 iterations.

        This is efficient.

   Therefore, we will implement:
        - For L=1: use a precomputed count of each letter.
        - For L=2: use precomputed counts for adjacent pairs (both horizontally and vertically).
        - For L>=3: iterate over splits i from i0 to i1, and for each split iterate over r and c in the valid ranges, and use hashes to check.

   But note: the worst-case for L>=3 might be too slow, but note that the total work over all queries might be not the worst-case because the total length of queries is 200000 and the actual work depends on the grid size and the split ranges.

   We hope that in practice either the grid is not too large (500x500) and the number of queries of length>=3 is not too large, or the valid ranges for r and c are small.

   Let's do worst-case analysis for a query of length L=3 on a grid of 500x500:
        i0 = max(0,3-500)=0, i1 = min(2,499)=2.
        i=0: r in [0,500-3] = [0,497] -> 498 rows, c in [0,499] -> 500 columns -> 498*500 = 249000.
        i=1: r in [0,500-2] = [0,498] -> 499 rows, c in [0,499-1]= [0,498] -> 499*499 = 249001.
        i=2: r in [0,500-1] = [0,499] -> 500 rows, c in [0,499-2]= [0,497] -> 500*498 = 249000.
        total iterations = 249000+249001+249000 = 747001.

   For a query of length L=500:
        i0 = max(0,500-500)=0, i1 = min(499,499)=499.
        i=0: (500-500+0+1)=1 * (500-0)=500 -> 500.
        i=1: (500-500+1+1)=2 * (500-1)=2*499=998.
        i=2: 3 * 498 = 1494.
        ...
        i=k: (k+1) * (500-k)
        This is a quadratic: f(k) = (k+1)*(500-k) = 500k -k^2 + 500 -k = -k^2 + 499k + 500.
        The summation from k=0 to 499: 
           sum_{k=0}^{499} (k+1)(500-k) = sum_{k=0}^{499} (500+499k -k^2) 
           = 500*500 + 499 * sum_{k=0}^{499} k - sum_{k=0}^{499} k^2
           = 250000 + 499 * (499*500/2) - (499*500*999/6)
        We can compute:
           sum_{k=0}^{499} k = 499*500/2 = 124750
           sum_{k=0}^{499} k^2 = 499*500*999/6 = ?

        Actually, we can use formulas:
           sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k = n(n-1)/2.
           sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k^2 = (n-1)n(2n-1)/6.

        Here n=500.
           sum_{k=0}^{499} k = 499*500/2 = 124750.
           sum_{k=0}^{499} k^2 = (499 * 500 * 999) / 6 = let's compute: 
               499/3 = 166.333, so better: 499*500*999 / 6 = (499 * 500 * 999) / 6
               = (499 * 999) * 500 / 6
               499*999 = 499*(1000-1)=499000-499=498501
               498501 * 500 = 249250500
               249250500 / 6 = 41541750.

           Then total = 250000 + 499 * 124750 - 41541750.

        This is a big number, but note: we are only summing 500 terms. We can compute by code or bound: 
            maximum term is when k=249 or 250: (250+1)*(500-250)=251*250=62750.
            summation: 500 * 62750 = 31.375e6? -> actually not, because the terms are not constant.

        Alternatively, note that the summation is the same as the total work for the query.

        We can write a program to compute: 
            s = 0;
            for (int i=0; i<500; i++) {
                int term = (i+1) * (500-i);
                s += term;
            }
        -> s = 41925000? 

        Let me compute: 
          i=0: 1*500 = 500
          i=1: 2*499 = 998
          i=2: 3*498 = 1494
          ...
          i=499: 500*1 = 500.

        This is not linear. The sum is sum_{i=0}^{499} (i+1)*(500-i) = sum_{j=1}^{500} j*(500+1-j) = sum_{j=1}^{500} (501j - j^2)

        = 501 * sum_{j=1}^{500} j - sum_{j=1}^{500} j^2
        = 501 * (500*501/2) - (500*501*1001/6)
        = 501 * 125250 - (500*501*1001/6)

        Let's compute:
          501 * 125250 = 62750250.
          500*501 = 250500, then 250500 * 1001 = 250500*1000 + 250500 = 250500000+250500=250750500, then /6 = 41791750.
          Then s = 62750250 - 41791750 = 20958500.

        So total work for a query of length 500: 20958500.

        Then for 100 such queries: 100 * 20958500 = 2095850000, which is 2e9 -> acceptable in 5 seconds.

        Therefore, the work for a query of length L is bounded by about 20e6 for L=500, and for L=3 it is about 747000.

        Now, what is the total work for all queries of length>=3? 
            Let F(L) = work for a query of length L.
            We have: 
               F(L) = sum_{i=i0}^{i1} ( (R - (L-i)) * (C - i) )
                      = sum_{i=i0}^{i1} ( (500 - L + i + 1) * (500 - i) )

            We want to bound the sum_{query S of length>=3} F(|S|).

            Let the total length of these queries be T (<=200000).

            How to bound the sum_{S} F(|S|) in terms of T? 

            Note: the function F(L) might be large for L around 500, and small for small L.

            Example: 
               L=3: F(3) = 747001.
               L=4: 
                   i0 = max(0,4-500)=0, i1=min(3,499)=3.
                   i=0: (500-4+0+1)*(500-0)=497*500 = 248500.
                   i=1: (500-4+1+1)*(500-1)=498*499 = 248502.
                   i=2: 499*498 = 248502.
                   i=3: 500*497 = 248500.
                   total = 248500*2 + 248502*2 = about 994004.

               L=500: F(500)=20958500.

            The worst-case is to have as many as possible queries of length 500.

            The total length T=200000, so the number of queries of length 500: floor(200000/500)=400.

            Then total work = 400 * 20958500 = 8383400000.

            Queries of length 499: similarly, F(499) = ? 
                   i0 = max(0,499-500)=0, i1=min(498,499)=498.
                   then F(499) = sum_{i=0}^{498} ( (500 - 499 + i + 1) * (500-i) ) = sum_{i=0}^{498} ( (1+i+1) * (500-i) ) = sum_{i=0}^{498} ( (i+2) * (500-i) )
                   = sum_{i=0}^{498} (500(i+2) - i(i+2)) = ... 
                   = use the same method: 
                         = sum_{i=0}^{498} ( (500-i)*(i+2) )
                         = sum_{j=0}^{498} (500-j)*(j+2)   [j=i]
                         = sum_{j=0}^{498} [ 500j + 1000 - j^2 -2j ]
                         = sum_{j=0}^{498} [ -j^2 + 498j + 1000 ]

                   = - sum j^2 (0..498) + 498 * sum j (0..498) + 1000 * 499.

                   sum_{j=0}^{498} j = 498*499/2 = 124251.
                   sum_{j=0}^{498} j^2 = 498*499*997/6 = ? 

                   = (498*499*997)/6 = let's compute:
                         498/6 = 83, so 83 * 499 * 997 = 83 * (499*997)

                   We can compute: 499*997 = 499*(1000-3)=499000-1497=497503.
                   then 83 * 497503 = 41292749.

                   Then total = -41292749 + 498 * 124251 + 1000*499
                   = -41292749 + 498*124251 = 498*124251 = let's compute: 500*124251=62125500, then subtract 2*124251=248502 -> 62125500-248502=61876998.
                   = 61876998 - 41292749 = 20584249.
                   then + 499000 = 21083249.

                   So F(499) = 21083249.

            Then if we have floor(200000/499)= floor(400.8)=400 queries of length 499, total work = 400 * 21083249 = 8433299600.

            This is about 8.4e9.

        Therefore, the total work for the queries of length>=3 is bounded by about 8.4e9, which is acceptable in 5 seconds.

   Why? 
        Because 8.4e9 operations might be around 8 seconds in C++ if each operation is a few instructions.

   But note: we have to do hashing for each (r,c) in the valid range: 
        For each (r,c) in the valid range for a split i, we do:
            hash1 = get_row_hash(r, c, c+i)   -> which is O(1) using the precomputed row hash.
            if (hash1 != hash_horiz) continue;
            if (vertical length>0) {
                hash2 = get_col_hash(c+i, r+1, r+ (L-i-1)) -> O(1)
                if (hash2 != hash_vert) continue;
            }
            then ans++.

        So per (r,c) we do O(1) work.

   Therefore, the total work per query is the sum_{i} ( (R - (L-i)) * (C - i) ), and we just computed that the worst-case total work for all queries of length>=3 is about 8.4e9.

   Additionally, we have to do the hashing for the query string: O(L) per query, and the total length of queries is 200000, so that's 200000.

   And for queries of length 1 and 2, we do O(1) per query.

   Therefore, the solution is:
        Precomputation:
          - Precompute the base powers up to max_len = max(R, C) (which is 500).
          - Precompute row hashes for the grid.
          - Precompute column hashes for the grid.
          - Precompute a global frequency for each letter for the entire grid (for queries of length1).
          - Precompute two 2D arrays (or 2D tables) for adjacent pairs:
                hor_pairs: a 26x26 array, hor_pairs[i][j] = number of times that letter i is followed by letter j horizontally in the grid.
                ver_pairs: similarly for vertically.

        For each query:
          if L==1: 
               ans = freq[S[0]]
          else if L==2:
               if S[0] and S[1] are uppercase letters:
                   a = S[0]-'A', b = S[1]-'A'
                   ans = hor_pairs[a][b] + ver_pairs[a][b]
          else:
               if L > R+C-1: 
                   ans = 0
               else:
                   // Precompute the hash for the entire query string.
                   vector<ull> H_S(L+1, 0);
                   for j=0 to L-1: 
                         H_S[j+1] = H_S[j]*131 + (S[j]-'A'+1)

                   i0 = max(0, L-R);
                   i1 = min(L-1, C-1);
                   ans = 0;
                   for i = i0 to i1:
                         h_len = i+1;
                         v_len = L - i - 1;

                         // Compute the two hashes for the query string for this split.
                         ull hash_horiz = H_S[i+1];   // first i+1 chars.
                         ull hash_vert = 0;
                         if (v_len > 0) {
                             hash_vert = H_S[L] - H_S[i+1] * pow_base[v_len];
                         }

                         // Range for r: [0, R - (L-i) - 1]? 
                         //   Actually: r from 0 to R - (L-i) [inclusive] -> because the last row index: r + v_len = r + (L-i-1) must be <= R-1 -> r <= R-1 - (L-i-1) = R - (L-i)
                         //   So r in [0, R - (L-i)].
                         int max_r = R - (L-i);   // r from 0 to max_r-1? -> if we use 0-indexed and grid rows 0..R-1, then r in [0, max_r-1] if we require r+v_len < R? 
                         //   Actually, the vertical part goes from row r+1 to row r+v_len = r+1 + v_len - 1 = r+v_len.
                         //   We require r+v_len <= R-1 -> r <= R-1 - v_len = R-1 - (L-i-1) = R - (L-i)
                         //   So r in [0, R - (L-i)) -> integers: r = 0,1,..., R - (L-i) - 1? 
                         //   But note: if v_len==0, then we don't require any vertical move, then r can be from 0 to R-1.
                         //   However, our formula: if v_len==0, then R - (L-i) = R - (L-i) = R - (L-i) [L-i = L-i, even if v_len=0] -> but L-i = i+1? -> no: L-i = (i+1) + v_len - (i+1)? -> actually: L = h_len+v_len = (i+1) + v_len, so L-i = 1+v_len.
                         //   So R - (L-i) = R - (1+v_len). 
                         //   But if v_len=0, then R - (1+0)=R-1 -> so r in [0, R-1] -> which is correct.

                         // Therefore, we let:
                         int r_low = 0;
                         int r_high = R - (L-i);   // r_high is the exclusive upper bound? -> no, we want r_high inclusive: r_high = R - (L-i) - 1? 
                         //   But note: the condition is r <= R - (L-i) - 1? -> no, the condition is r <= R - (L-i). Actually, we allow r = R - (L-i) only if that makes the vertical part go out of bounds? 

                         //   The vertical part starts at r+1 and goes down for v_len steps: the last row is r+v_len = r + (L-i-1).
                         //   We require: r + (L-i-1) <= R-1  -> r <= R-1 - (L-i-1) = R - (L-i)   [exactly]
                         //   So r can be R - (L-i) if that is an integer? 
                         //   But note: R - (L-i) might be fractional? no, integer.
                         //   And if r = R - (L-i), then the last row = (R - (L-i)) + (L-i-1) = R-1 -> valid.

                         //   Therefore, r in [0, R - (L-i)] inclusive.

                         // But note: R - (L-i) might be negative -> then skip this split. But we have i>= L-R, so R - (L-i) = R - L + i >=0.

                         int nr = R - (L-i);   // if nr<0, skip the split -> but we have i>=L-R so nr>=0.
                         if (nr < 0) continue;
                         int nc = C - i - 1;    // c in [0, nc]? -> because c+i <= C-1 -> c <= C-1-i.

                         for (int r=0; r<=nr; r++) {

                                 if (h1 != hash_horiz) 
                                     continue;

                                         continue;
                                 }
                                 ans++;
                             }
                         }
                   }

   Let's test with the sample: "ABC" in the sample grid.

   Sample grid:
        grid[0] = "ABC"
        grid[1] = "BCD"
        grid[2] = "DAB"

   Query "ABC": L=3.
        i0 = max(0,3-3)=0, i1 = min(2,2)=2.
        i=0:
            h_len=1, v_len=2.
            hash_horiz = H_S[1] = 'A' in the query: 'A' -> 'A'-'A'+1=1 -> so 1.
            hash_vert = H_S[3] - H_S[1]*pow_base[2] 
                       = hash("ABC") - hash("A")*pow_base[2]
                       = (1*131^2 + 2*131 + 3) - (1)*131^2 = 2*131+3 = 262+3=265.

            r in [0, R - (3-0)] = [0, 3-3]=[0,0] -> r=0.
            c in [0, C-1-0]=[0,2] (C=3, so 3-1=2).

            r=0, c=0: 
                horizontal: row0 from c=0 to c=0: "A" -> hash = 1 -> matches.
                vertical: column0 (c+i=0) from row1 to row2: that is "B" and "D" -> 
                    H_col[0][1..3] = H_col[0][3] - H_col[0][1] * pow_base[2]
                    How did we precompute H_col[0]?
                       H_col[0][0]=0
                       H_col[0][1]= grid[0][0] = 'A' -> 1.
                       H_col[0][2]= 1*131 + grid[1][0] = 1*131 + 'B' (which is 2) = 131+2=133.
                       H_col[0][3]= 133*131 + grid[2][0] = 133*131 + 'D' (4) = 17423+4=17427.
                    Then the vertical part: from row1 to row2: rows 1 and 2 -> 
                         = H_col[0][3] - H_col[0][1] * 131^2 = 17427 - 1* (131^2) = 17427 - 17161 = 266.
                    But we want 265? -> doesn't match.

                So skip.

            c=1: 
                horizontal: row0, c=1: only "B" -> hash = 2.
                but hash_horiz=1 -> skip.

            c=2: 
                horizontal: "C" -> 3, skip.

            no count for i=0.

        i=1:
            h_len=2, v_len=1.
            hash_horiz = H_S[2] = hash("AB") = 1*131+2 = 133.
            hash_vert = H_S[3]-H_S[2]*pow_base[1] = (1*131^2+2*131+3) - (1*131+2)*131 = (17161+262+3) - (133*131) = 17426 - 17423 = 3.

            r in [0, R - (3-1)] = [0, 3-2] = [0,1].
            c in [0, C-1-1] = [0,1].

            r=0, c=0:
                horizontal: "AB" -> 
                    H_row[0][0+2] - H_row[0][0] * pow_base[2] = (H_row[0][2]) - 0? 
                    How we did row0: 
                         H_row[0][0]=0
                         H_row[0][1]=1
                         H_row[0][2]=1*131+2=133
                         H_row[0][3]=133*131+3=17426+3=17429.
                    Then for [0,2): from index0 to 1: length=2 -> 
                         = H_row[0][2] - H_row[0][0]*pow_base[2] = 133 - 0 = 133 -> matches.
                vertical: column c+i = 0+1=1, from row1: 
                    grid[1][1] = 'C'? 
                    But wait: the vertical part should be from row1 (r+1) to row1 (v_len=1) -> one character: grid[1][1]='C' -> which is 3.
                    H_col[1] for column1: 
                         H_col[1][0]=0
                         H_col[1][1]= grid[0][1]='B'=2.
                         H_col[1][2]= 2*131+grid[1][1]='C'=3 -> 2*131+3=262+3=265.
                         H_col[1][3]= 265*131+grid[2][1]='A'=1 -> 265*131+1 = 34715+1=34716.
                    The segment: row1: from index1 to 1 (length1) -> 
                         = H_col[1][2] - H_col[1][1] * pow_base[1] = 265 - 2*131 = 265-262=3 -> matches.

                So count++.

            r=0, c=1:
                horizontal: "BC" -> 
                    H_row[0][1+2] - H_row[0][1] * pow_base[2] = H_row[0][3] - H_row[0][1] * 131^2 = 17429 - 1*17161 = 17429-17161=268.
                    but hash_horiz=133 -> skip.

            r=1, c=0:
                horizontal: row1: "BC" -> 
                    H_row[1][0+2] - H_row[1][0] * pow_base[2] 
                         We compute row1: 
                             H_row[1][0]=0
                             H_row[1][1]='B'=2
                             H_row[1][2]=2*131+'C'=262+3=265
                             H_row[1][3]=265*131+'D'=  265*131=34715+4=34719.
                         Then = 265 - 0 = 265 -> not 133.

            r=1, c=1: 
                horizontal: row1, c=1 to c+1=2: "CD" -> 
                    H_row[1][3] - H_row[1][1] * 131^2 = 34719 - 2 * 17161 = 34719-34322=397.

            no more for i=1.

        i=2:
            h_len=3, v_len=0.
            hash_horiz = H_S[3] = 1*131^2+2*131+3 = 17161+262+3=17426.
            r in [0, R - (3-2)] = [0, 3-1]=[0,2] -> 3 rows.
            c in [0, C-1-2]= [0,0] -> only c=0.

            r=0, c=0: 
                horizontal: "ABC" -> 
                    H_row[0][3] - H_row[0][0] * 131^3 = 17429 - 0 = 17429 -> but we want 17426? -> doesn't match.

            Why? 
                Our computation for the query: 
                    H_S[3] = 1*131^2 + 2*131 + 3 = 17161+262+3=17426.
                But the grid row0: 
                    'A'=1, 'B'=2, 'C'=3.
                    H_row[0][3] = 1*131^2 + 2*131 + 3 = 17426? 
                    But we computed 17429 above? 

            We did: 
                H_row[0][0]=0
                H_row[0][1]=1
                H_row[0][2]=1*131+2=133
                H_row[0][3]=133*131+3=  133*131 = 17423? then +3=17426? 
                I see: 133*131 = let me compute: 130*131 = 17030, 3*131=393 -> total 17423, then +3=17426.

            So it matches.

            So for r=0, c=0: horizontal matches -> count++.

            r=1, c=0: 
                horizontal: "BCD" -> 
                    H_row[1][3] = 34719, and we want 17426? -> doesn't match.

            r=2, c=0:
                horizontal: "DAB" -> 
                    We compute: 
                         H_row[2][0]=0
                         H_row[2][1]='D'=4
                         H_row[2][2]=4*131+'A'=524+1=525
                         H_row[2][3]=525*131+'B'=525*131=68775+2=68777.
                    -> not 17426.

            So for i=2: we get one count.

        Total ans = 1 (from i=1) + 1 (from i=2) = 2.

        This matches.

   Therefore, we will implement accordingly.

   Let's code accordingly.

   Note: We must be cautious about the bounds for the vertical part: 
        In the column hash: 
            H_col[col][0]=0
            H_col[col][1]= grid[0][col]
            H_col[col][2]= grid[0][col]*131+grid[1][col]
            ...

        Then the segment from row r1 to row r2 (inclusive) in column col has:
            start_index = r1, end_index = r2 (inclusive), length = len = r2 - r1 + 1.
            But in our vertical part: 
                we want the segment from row r+1 to row r+v_len (which is r+v_len, because we go down v_len steps: from row r+1 to row r+v_len, inclusive) -> 
                    the number of rows = v_len.
            Therefore, the hash = H_col[col][r+v_len+1] - H_col[col][r+1] * pow_base[v_len]

   We'll implement accordingly.

   Summary of the code:

        Precomputation for grid rows and columns hashes.

        Precomputation for base powers.

        Precomputation for the frequency of each letter.

        Precomputation for adjacent pairs (horizontal and vertical) for length2.

        For each query:
            if L==1: use freq.
            if L==2: use hor_pairs and ver_pairs.
            else if L>R+C-1: 0.
            else:
                Precompute H_S for the entire string.
                ans = 0
                i0 = max(0, L-R);
                i1 = min(L-1, C-1);
                if (i0>i1) output 0.
                For i in [i0, i1]:
                    h_len = i+1;
                    v_len = L-i-1;
                    // Compute the required hashes for the query
                    ull hash_horiz = H_S[h_len];
                    ull hash_vert = 0;
                    if (v_len>0) {
                        hash_vert = H_S[h_len+v_len] - H_S[h_len] * pow_base[v_len];
                    }
                    int max_r = R - (L-i);   // r from 0 to max_r (inclusive)
                    int max_c = C - h_len;    // c from 0 to max_c (inclusive) [because c+h_len-1 <= C-1 -> c<=C-1 - (h_len-1) = C - h_len]

                    // If either dimension is negative, skip.
                    if (max_r < 0 || max_c < 0) 
                         continue;

                    for (int r=0; r<=max_r; r++) {
                         for (int c=0; c<=max_c; c++) {
                              ull h_row_val = H_row[r][c+h_len] - H_row[r][c] * pow_base[h_len];
                              if (h_row_val != hash_horiz) continue;

                              if (v_len>0) {
                                  ull h_col_val = H_col[c+i][r+1+v_len] - H_col[c+i][r+1] * pow_base[v_len];
                                  if (h_col_val != hash_vert) continue;
                              }
                              ans++;
                         }
                    }
                output ans.

   Let's test with the sample "BC" (L=2) to see if we get 3.

   We are handling L=2 separately: 
        hor_pairs: 
            row0: "ABC": pairs: ('A','B') and ('B','C')
            row1: "BCD": ('B','C'), ('C','D')
            row2: "DAB": ('D','A'), ('A','B')
            So hor_pairs: 
                'A'->'B': 2 times? (row0 and row2)
                'B'->'C': 1 time? (row0) -> actually row0: 'B' is at (0,1) and then 'C' at (0,2) -> one occurrence? 
                         row1: 'B'->'C' at (1,0)->(1,1) -> one occurrence? 
                Actually: 
                    row0: two horizontal pairs of length2: 
                         starting at c=0: "AB"
                         starting at c=1: "BC"
                    row1: 
                         c=0: "BC", c=1: "CD"
                    row2:
                         c=0: "DA", c=1: "AB"
                So:
                    "AB": 2 times? (row0 and row2) -> but row0: "AB", row2: "AB" at c=1? 
                    Actually: row0: 
                         c=0: "AB" -> yes.
                         c=1: "BC" -> yes.
                    row1: 
                         c=0: "BC" -> yes.
                         c=1: "CD" -> no for "BC"?
                    row2:
                         c=0: "DA" -> no.
                         c=1: "AB" -> yes.

                So for "AB": row0: c=0 and row2: c=1 -> 2.
                    "BC": row0: c=1 and row1: c=0 -> 2.

            But wait, the query "BC" has two parts: 
                split i=0: horizontal part="B", vertical part="C" -> one occurrence: (0,1,0,0) and (1,0,0,0) -> but also (0,1,1,0) -> that's the vertical part starting at (0,1) and going down to (1,1) -> but that is not allowed? 
                Actually, the grid for "BC" can be:
                    (0,1,0,1) -> no, that would be "BC" horizontally? -> but we have i=1 for horizontal part of length2? 
                For a length2 string, we have two splits: 
                    i=0: horizontal part="B", vertical part="C": 
                         This means: start at (r,c), then don't move right? then move down one step? 
                         So we are looking for a 'B' and then below it a 'C'. 
                         In the grid: 
                              (0,1): 'B', and below (1,1) is 'C'? -> so that's one occurrence.
                              (1,0): 'B', and below (2,0) is 'D'? -> not 'C'.
                              (0,1) and (1,1) is one occurrence? -> and (1,0) and (2,0) is not.
                    i=1: horizontal part="BC", vertical part="" -> so we look for a horizontal "BC". 
                         (0,1): "BC" -> one occurrence.
                         (1,0): "BC" -> one occurrence.

                         total = 1 (from i=0) + 2 (from i=1) = 3.

            So in our length2 separate part, we have:
                hor_pairs for "BC" = 2  (from the horizontal segments of length2: (0,1) and (1,0))
                ver_pairs for "BC" = 1  (from the vertical segment: (0,1) has below 'C', but (1,0) has below 'D', so only one vertical occurrence)

                Then total = 2+1 = 3.

            So we need to precompute for vertical pairs: 
                In the grid, we want to count the pairs (r,c) such that grid[r][c] is the first char and grid[r+1][c] is the second char.

                For "BC": 
                    (0,1): 'B' and then (1,1)='C' -> count=1.
                    (1,0): 'B' and (2,0)='D' -> not.
                    (0,0): 'A' and (1,0)='B' -> not.
                    (1,1): 'C' and (2,1)='A' -> not.
                    (0,2): 'C' and (1,2)='D' -> not.

                So only one.

            Therefore, ver_pairs['B']['C'] = 1.

            Then total = hor_pairs['B']['C'] + ver_pairs['B']['C'] = 2+1=3.

   We'll do that.

   Let's code accordingly.

   Note: The grid has R rows and C columns.

   Precomputation for hor_pairs and ver_pairs:
        hor_pairs = a 2D array of size 26x26, initialized to 0.
        for r from 0 to R-1:
            for c from 0 to C-2:
                a = grid[r][c] - 'A'
                b = grid[r][c+1] - 'A'
                hor_pairs[a][b]++

        ver_pairs = similarly:
            for r from 0 to R-2:
                for c from 0 to C-1:
                    a = grid[r][c] - 'A'
                    b = grid[r+1][c] - 'A'
                    ver_pairs[a][b]++

   Finally, note: the grid characters are uppercase.

   Let's hope.

   We'll run the sample inputs.

   Sample Input #1: 
        "ABC" -> 2 (as above)
        "BC" -> 3
        "BD" -> 1
        "AC" -> 0
        "A" -> 2.

   Sample Input #2:
        2 3 3
        AAA
        AAA
        A -> 6? because there are 6 'A's? 
        AAA: 
            Occurrences: 
                horizontal: 
                   row0: two: c=0 and c=1? 
                   row1: two: c=0 and c=1.
                vertical: 
                   with split i=0: 
                       (0,0): horizontal 'A', then vertical "AA" (from (1,0) and (2,0))? -> but wait the grid has only 2 rows? 
                   Actually, the grid: 2 rows, so a vertical part of length2 is not possible? 
            How many for "AAA": 
                splits: 
                   i0 = max(0,3-2)=1, i1 = min(2,2)=2.
                i=1: horizontal part of length2: "AA", then vertical part of length1: "A". 
                    We require: 
                         r in [0, R - (3-1)] = [0,2-2]=0 -> r=0.
                         c in [0, C-1-1]=[0,1] (because C=3, so 3-2=1? wait: i=1 -> h_len=2, so c in [0, C-2] = [0,1]).
                    r=0, c=0: 
                         horizontal: "AA" (from (0,0) and (0,1)): 
                             H_row[0][2] - H_row[0][0] * 131^2 = (hash for "AAA" for the first two?) 
                             Actually, we only have "AAA" in row0? -> "AA" at (0,0) and (0,1) -> 
                                 H_row[0][0]=0
                                 H_row[0][1]='A'=1
                                 H_row[0][2]=1*131+1=132
                                 Then hash for "AA" = 132 - 0 = 132.
                         The query "AAA": 
                             H_S[2] = hash for "AA" = 1*131+1=132 -> matches.
                         vertical: column c+i = 0+1=1, from row1: only one char: grid[1][1] should be 'A'. 
                             H_col[1][2] - H_col[1][1] * 131 = 
                                 H_col[1][0]=0
                                 H_col[1][1]= grid[0][1]='A'=1
                                 H_col[1][2]=1*131+grid[1][1] -> but grid[1][1] is 'A'=1 -> 132.
                             Then hash_vert = 132 - 1*131 = 1.
                         The vertical part of the query: S[2:3] = "A" -> hash = 1 -> matches.

                         count++.

                    r=0, c=1: 
                         horizontal: from (0,1) to (0,2): "AA" -> 
                                 H_row[0][3] - H_row[0][1]*131^2 = (1*131^2+1*131+1) - 1*131^2 = 131+1=132 -> matches.
                         vertical: column 1+1=2, row1: grid[1][2]='A'. 
                                 H_col[2][2] - H_col[2][1]*131 = (0 then 1 then 131+1=132) -> 132 - 1*131=1 -> matches.

                         count++ -> total=2.

                i=2: horizontal part of length3: "AAA", vertical part empty.
                    r in [0, R - (3-2)] = [0,2-1]=[0,1] (both rows)
                    c in [0, C-3] = [0,0] (only c=0)

                    r=0, c=0: 
                         horizontal: "AAA" -> 
                                 H_row[0][3] - H_row[0][0] * 131^3 = (1*131^2+1*131+1) - 0 = 17161+131+1=17293.
                         The query: "AAA" -> H_S[3] = 1*131^2+1*131+1=17293? 
                                 = 131^2 = 17161, 131, 1 -> 17161+131+1=17293 -> matches.

                         count++.

                    r=1, c=0: 
                         horizontal: row1: "AAA" -> 
                                 H_row[1][3] = same as row0? -> yes, because the row is "AAA". 
                                 so 17293 -> matches.

                         count++.

                    total for i=2: 2.

                So total = 2 (from i=1) + 2 (from i=2) = 4.

            Therefore, the second sample: 
                A: 6
                AAA: 4
                AAAAA: 0.

   But the sample output is:
        6
        4
        0

   So we match.

   We'll code accordingly.

   Note: The base and modulus: we use base=131 and unsigned long long (natural modulo 2^64).

   Let's code accordingly.

   IMPORTANT: The grid is provided as R lines of C characters.

   We assume R and C as given.

   We'll precompute:
        vector<ull> pow_base(max_len+1); // max_len = max(R,C) (since the maximum exponent we need is up to max(R,C))

   Steps:

        Read R, C, Q.
        Read grid.

        Precomputation for pow_base: 
            max_len = max(R, C);
            pow_base[0]=1;
            for i=1 to max_len: pow_base[i] = pow_base[i-1] * 131;

        Precompute H_row: R x (C+1)
            for r=0 to R-1:
                H_row[r][0]=0;
                for c=0 to C-1:
                    H_row[r][c+1] = H_row[r][c]*131 + (grid[r][c]-'A'+1);

        Precompute H_col: C x (R+1)
            for c=0 to C-1:
                H_col[c][0]=0;
                for r=0 to R-1:
                    H_col[c][r+1] = H_col[c][r]*131 + (grid[r][c]-'A'+1);

        Precompute freq: 
            vector<ull> freq(26,0);
            for each cell: freq[grid[r][c]-'A']++;

        Precompute hor_pairs and ver_pairs: 
            vector<vector<int>> hor_pairs(26, vector<int>(26,0));
            for r=0 to R-1:
                for c=0 to C-2:
                    int a = grid[r][c] - 'A';
                    int b = grid[r][c+1] - 'A';
                    hor_pairs[a][b]++;

            vector<vector<int>> ver_pairs(26, vector<int>(26,0));
            for r=0 to R-2:
                for c=0 to C-1:
                    int a = grid[r][c] - 'A';
                    int b = grid[r+1][c] - 'A';
                    ver_pairs[a][b]++;

        Then process Q queries.

   Note: The grid is stored with R rows and C columns.

   Let's code accordingly.

   Note: The constraints on the total length of queries (200000) and the grid size (500x500) should be manageable.

   We hope.

   We'll run the sample tests.

   Note: The base is 131, and we use (char-'A'+1) to avoid 0.

   Let's go.
