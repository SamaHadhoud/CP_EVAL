 We are given: N, M, Q and an initial array A of N integers.
 Then M lines: first integer R_i, then R_i integers for the new employees in year i.
 Then Q lines: each has (X_i, Y_i, Z_i) meaning update the Y_i-th new employee in year X_i to Z_i.

 Important: The changes are cumulative.

 The key is: we only care about Randall (the first employee) and whether he remains after M years.
 How does Randall get fired?
   At the end of year i, the company replaces the R_i worst-performing employees.
   Randall is fired in year i if his performance is among the R_i worst at the start of year i.

 But note: if he survives year i, then he remains for the next year.

 Insight: 
   Let F(t) = number of employees at the start of year t that have performance strictly less than A0 (Randall's performance).
   Condition for year t: at the start of year t, there must be at least R_t employees worse than Randall (so that Randall is not in the R_t worst).
        i.e., F(t) >= R_t.

   How does F(t) evolve?
        Year 1: F(1) = count of employees in A (the initial array) with value < A[0].
        Year 2: 
            At the end of year 1: we remove R_1 employees (the R_1 worst). How many of the removed were worse than Randall? 
                Note: we remove the R_1 worst. Since Randall is not worse than himself, if there are F(1) employees worse than him, then as long as F(1) >= R_1, 
                we remove exactly R_1 employees that are worse? Actually, we remove the R_1 worst, which must include all the worse ones if there are at least R_1 worse ones?
                But if F(1) < R_1, then we remove all F(1) worse ones and then we remove some that are not worse (which might include Randall? but note: Randall is not worse than himself, so if we remove an employee that is not worse, it must be one that is >= Randall? But note: the worst employees are the smallest numbers. And we know that Randall is A0. So if we remove an employee that is not worse, then that employee must be at least A0? However, if an employee has the same performance? The problem states distinct integers. So all are distinct.

            Therefore, in year 1, we remove exactly min(F(1), R_1) worse employees? Actually, we remove the R_1 worst. Since the worst employees are the ones with the smallest numbers, and the worse ones (less than A0) are all included in the worst? Not necessarily: if we have some employees with performance less than A0 and some with performance greater, the worst are the smallest. So the R_1 worst are the R_1 smallest. And if there are F(1) employees with performance less than A0, then the R_1 smallest must include all of the worse ones if R_1 >= F(1)? Actually, no: the worse ones are all the ones below A0, and they are the smallest? Not necessarily: there might be an employee with performance 100 and another with 200, and A0=150: then the worse ones are the ones below 150. But the smallest employee is 100 (which is worse) and then 200 is above. So the set of worse ones is exactly the ones below A0. The worst employees are the smallest, so if we have F(1) worse ones, then the R_1 worst will be:
                - All F(1) worse ones if R_1 >= F(1)
                - Otherwise, exactly the R_1 smallest, which are all worse ones? Yes, because any worse one is smaller than A0, and any non-worse one is >= A0. So the worse ones are the smallest? Actually, not necessarily: we could have a worse one that is 100 and a non-worse one that is 50? That would be a contradiction: 50 is less than 100 and less than A0? Then 50 would be worse. So non-worse ones are >= A0, and worse ones are < A0. Therefore, the entire set of worse ones is exactly the set of employees with performance less than A0, and they are all smaller than the non-worse ones. Therefore, the worst employees are the worse ones first? So the R_1 worst employees are:
                  - The min(R_1, F(1)) worse employees (if R_1 <= F(1), then we remove R_1 worse employees, and if R_1 > F(1), then we remove all F(1) worse employees and then remove R_1 - F(1) non-worse employees? But note: non-worse ones are >= A0, so Randall (A0) is in the non-worse ones. And if we remove a non-worse employee, then we might remove Randall? 

            However, the problem says: we remove the R_i worst. Since Randall's performance is A0, and if we remove a non-worse employee, that employee must have performance >= A0. But note: if there are multiple employees with performance >= A0, then we remove the smallest among the non-worse? But the non-worse set is sorted? Actually, the entire set of employees is sorted by performance. The worst are the smallest. So the worst R_1 employees are the R_1 smallest. Since the worse ones (all < A0) are all smaller than the non-worse ones (>= A0), then the set of employees is partitioned: [worse ones] (all < A0) then [non-worse] (>= A0). Therefore, the R_1 worst are:
                - The entire set of worse ones (if F(1) <= R_1) and then the next R_1 - F(1) smallest non-worse ones.

            Therefore, if R_1 > F(1), then Randall might be removed? Actually, the non-worse ones include Randall. The smallest non-worse ones: we start from the smallest non-worse. The smallest non-worse is the smallest employee that is >= A0. Since Randall has performance A0, if there is an employee with performance exactly A0? Only Randall? But note: the initial array has distinct integers. So Randall is the only one with A0? Not necessarily: the problem says "no two people have the same performance", so yes, distinct. Therefore, the non-worse ones are: employees with performance >= A0, and the smallest non-worse is the smallest one in the non-worse set. That might be Randall? Or it might be an employee with performance exactly A0? Only Randall has A0. So the smallest non-worse is Randall? Or could there be an employee with performance between A0 and the next? 

            Actually, the non-worse set: we have at least Randall (A0) and then others that are >= A0. The smallest non-worse is the smallest value in the non-worse set. Since Randall is A0, and others are distinct and >= A0, the smallest non-worse is A0? So if we have to remove a non-worse employee, we remove the smallest non-worse, which is Randall? 

            Therefore, if F(1) < R_1, then we remove all F(1) worse employees and then we remove the next R_1 - F(1) non-worse employees, and the first non-worse employee we remove is Randall (because his performance is A0, the smallest in the non-worse set). 

            So condition: Randall survives year 1 if and only if F(1) >= R_1.

        Similarly, for year t: at the start of year t, we have F(t) worse employees. Then we remove R_t worst. This removal will remove:
            - min(F(t), R_t) worse employees and then if R_t > F(t), we remove the next R_t - F(t) non-worse employees, and the first non-worse employee we remove is Randall? 

        Therefore, Randall survives year t if and only if F(t) >= R_t.

   How does F(t) update?
        At the end of year t, we remove R_t employees. Then we add R_t new employees. 
        How many of the new employees are worse than Randall? Let G(t) = number of new employees in year t that have performance < A0.

        Then the worse employees at the start of year t+1 are:
            F(t) - min(F(t), R_t) + G(t)

        But note: if F(t) >= R_t, then we remove exactly R_t worse employees? Actually, we remove the R_t worst, which are the R_t smallest. And because the worse ones are the smallest, we remove exactly R_t worse employees? Actually, no: we remove the R_t worst, which are the R_t smallest. Since the worse ones are the smallest, we remove the first R_t in the sorted order, which are the worst. And they are all the worse ones that are present? Only if we have at least R_t worse ones. If we have F(t) >= R_t, then we remove exactly R_t worse employees. Then the worse employees left are F(t) - R_t. Then we add G(t) new worse employees. So:
            F(t+1) = F(t) - R_t + G(t)

        If F(t) < R_t, then we remove all F(t) worse employees and then we remove R_t - F(t) non-worse employees (which does not change the count of worse ones). Then we add G(t) new worse employees. So:
            F(t+1) = 0 - (we remove all worse ones) + G(t) = G(t)

        However, note that in the case F(t) < R_t, Randall is removed (so we don't care about the next years). Therefore, we can break early.

        But the problem: we have to check for M years. And we are doing Q scenarios. We want to avoid simulating each year for each scenario.

   Alternate Insight: we can define a recurrence for F(t) for the entire M years, but note that if at any year F(t) < R_t, then Randall is gone and we can stop. However, we have to check all M years? But the problem says: after M years.

   We can precompute the entire sequence of F(t) for t=1 to M+1? But then we have to update when a B value changes.

   How a change in a B_i affects the sequence?
        Suppose we change a new employee in year X: then G(X) changes by some delta (either +1, -1, or 0). Then for t = X+1 to M+1, the value of F(t) is updated as:
            F(t) = F(t) + delta   [if we consider the recurrence: F(X+1) = F(X) - R_X + G(X) ... then if G(X) changes by delta, then F(X+1) changes by delta, and then F(X+2) = F(X+1) - R_{X+1} + G(X+1) ... so it changes by delta, and so on.

        Therefore, the entire suffix of F(t) for t>=X+1 is shifted by delta.

   But note: we also have the condition for year t: we require F(t) >= R_t. So for each year t, we require:
        D(t) = F(t) - R_t >= 0.

   How does the update affect D(t)?
        For t from 1 to X: no change.
        For t = X: 
            Note: in the recurrence, the condition for year X depends on F(X) (which is computed from previous years) and not directly on G(X) for the condition at year X? Actually, the condition at year X uses F(X) (which is available at the start of year X) and then we use G(X) to compute F(X+1). But the condition for year X is: F(X) >= R_X. This condition does not involve G(X). 
        For t >= X+1: 
            F(t) becomes F(t) + delta, so D(t) = F(t) - R_t becomes D(t) + delta.

        However, note: the condition for year X is independent of the change. The change only affects the new employees added at the end of year X, which does not affect the removal at the start of year X. Therefore, the condition for year X is fixed.

        But wait: what if we change a new employee in year X? That new employee is added at the end of year X. So the change in the new employee in year X does not affect the condition for year X (because the condition for year X is based on the state at the start of year X). It only affects the state for the start of year X+1.

        Therefore, we can precompute for each year t from 1 to M:
            F(1) = F1 = count of initial employees < A0.
            For t from 1 to M:
                Condition: if F(t) < R_t -> Randall is fired in year t (so we break and output 0 for the scenario? but we have to check all years? because if he gets fired in year 3, then he is gone and doesn't come back. So we need to check that for every year t, F(t) >= R_t.

        How to update the entire sequence of conditions?
            We maintain an array D[1..M] where D[t] = F(t) - R_t.
            Then we need to know: is min_{t=1 to M} D[t] >= 0?

        How do we update D when we change G(X) by delta?
            For t from X+1 to M: 
                D[t] = D[t] + delta   (because F(t) increases by delta, and R_t is fixed)

            But note: D[X] is unchanged.

        However, what about the propagation? The recurrence for F(t) is:
            F(1) = F1
            For t from 1 to M:
                F(t+1) = F(t) - R_t + G(t)

            Then D[t] = F(t) - R_t.

            And note: 
                F(2) = F1 - R_1 + G(1) 
                F(3) = F(2) - R_2 + G(2) = F1 - R_1 + G(1) - R_2 + G(2)
                ...

            So F(t) = F1 - (R_1 + R_2 + ... + R_{t-1}) + (G(1) + G(2) + ... + G(t-1))

            Then D(t) = F1 - (R_1+...+R_{t-1}) + (G(1)+...+G(t-1)) - R_t

            Therefore, if we change G(X) by delta, then for any t > X, we add delta to F(t) and hence to D(t). For t <= X, no change.

        Therefore, we can precompute an array D0 for t=1..M without any updates:

            D0[1] = F1 - R_1
            D0[2] = F1 - R_1 + G(1) - R_2
            D0[3] = F1 - R_1 + G(1) - R_2 + G(2) - R_3
            ...

        Actually, we can write:
            D0[t] = F1 - (R_1 + R_2 + ... + R_t) + (G(1)+...+G(t-1))

        But note: for year t, the term for G(t) does not appear in D0[t]? Because G(t) is added at the end of year t and affects the next year. So indeed, only G(1) to G(t-1) are included.

        How about we define:
            S_R(t) = R_1 + R_2 + ... + R_t
            S_G(t) = G(1) + G(2) + ... + G(t)

        Then:
            D0[t] = F1 - S_R(t) + S_G(t-1)   [if we let S_G(0)=0]

        Now, if we update G(X) by adding delta, then for all t >= X, we update S_G(t) by adding delta for t>=X. But note in D0[t] for t>=X+1: we have S_G(t-1) becomes S_G(t-1)+delta. Therefore, for t>=X+1, D0[t] becomes D0[t] + delta.

        However, for t=X, we have D0[X] = F1 - S_R(X) + S_G(X-1) -> which does not include G(X), so no change.

        Therefore, the update: 
            For indices t from X+1 to M: D0[t] += delta.

        Then we require that for every t in [1, M]: D0[t] >= 0.

        We can maintain a segment tree / Fenwick tree for range updates? But we don't need range queries: we need the minimum value of D0 over t=1..M. And we are updating a contiguous suffix.

        We can use a segment tree with lazy propagation to support:
            - Range add (for a suffix) and 
            - Query the global minimum.

        Steps:
            Precomputation:
                F1 = count of initial employees < A0.
                Precompute the array D0 of length M (for t=1 to M) as:
                    D0[0] (for year1) = F1 - R_1   -> index0 for the segment tree: representing year1.
                    For year2: D0[1] = F1 - (R_1+R_2) + G(1)
                    ...

                Actually, we can compute iteratively:
                    Let H[1] = F1
                    For t from 1 to M:
                        D0[t-1] = H[t] - R_t   # for the condition at year t
                        Then H[t+1] = H[t] - R_t + G(t)   [if t>=1, then for the next year]

                Then we have D0 for year t at index t-1.

            Build a segment tree (min) for the array D0.

            For each query (X, Y, Z):
                We are updating the new employee in year X at position Y: change from old value to Z.
                Let old_val = B_arr[X][Y-1]   (since Y is 1-indexed)
                Let new_val = Z

                Compute:
                    old_contrib = 1 if old_val < A0 else 0
                    new_contrib = 1 if new_val < A0 else 0
                    delta = new_contrib - old_contrib

                If delta != 0:
                    Then we update G(X) by delta -> which affects D0 for indices from t = X+1 to M.

                    In the segment tree, we update the segment [X, M-1] (if we use 0-indexed: year1 is at index0, year2 at index1, ..., yearX is at index X-1, then yearX+1 is at index X, and yearM is at index M-1) by adding delta.

                Then we check: is the global minimum (min over indices 0 to M-1) >= 0?
                    If yes, output 1.
                    Else, output 0.

            Important: we must update the stored G(X) and the stored B_arr[X][Y-1] for future queries.

        However, note: what if the update causes the condition at year X to fail? 
            But note: the condition at year X is stored in D0[X-1] (if we index by year: yearX is at index X-1) and we do not update D0[X-1] because the update only affects years >= X+1. 
            And indeed, the condition at year X does not depend on the new employees of year X (they come after the removal). Therefore, the condition at year X is fixed by the state at the start of the year and the R_t for that year.

        Therefore, the entire condition for survival is captured by the array D0 and the segment tree.

   Special note: if M==0, then we have no years -> output 1.

   Steps in code:

        Step 1: Read N, M, Q and the initial array A.
        Step 2: A0 = A[0]
                F1 = count of x in A such that x < A0.

        Step 3: For i from 1 to M:
                Read R_i and then R_i integers for B_i.
                Store R_arr[i] = R_i, and B_arr[i] = list of R_i integers.
                Compute G_i = count of x in B_i such that x < A0.
                Store G_current[i] = G_i.

        Step 4: Precompute H[1..M+1] and then D0 for indices 1..M (we only need for the segment tree: an array of M values).

                H = [0]*(M+2)
                H[1] = F1
                For t in range(1, M+1):
                    # Condition for year t: H[t] >= R_arr[t] (if not, then Randall is gone at year t, but we still compute D0[t] = H[t]-R_arr[t] and then the segment tree min will be negative and we output 0 for the scenario? but note: we have to simulate the entire M years? However, if H[t] < R_arr[t], then we break the recurrence? Actually, the recurrence continues: 
                    # The recurrence: H[t+1] = H[t] - R_arr[t] + G_current[t]
                    # But if H[t] < R_arr[t], then we remove all the worse ones and then remove R_arr[t] - H[t] non-worse, and then we add G_current[t]. Then H[t+1] = 0 + G_current[t] = G_current[t] 
                    # However, the problem is: if at any year t, H[t] < R_arr[t], then Randall is fired. But the recurrence for the next years must be computed? Actually, we still need to compute the state for the next years? But the problem: we are only concerned with the entire M years. However, if Randall is fired in year t, then he is not present in the next years. But the problem asks: "whether he will still be in the company after M years". So if he is fired in any year, then after M years he is not present.

                    # However, note: once Randall is fired, he doesn't come back. But the recurrence for F(t) for t>t0 (if fired at t0) is not defined? Actually, we can still compute the recurrence for the worse count? But without Randall, the condition for the next years is irrelevant? However, the problem says: we have to update the new employees and then we have to know the entire state? 

                    # But note: the recurrence for H[t] (the count of employees worse than Randall) is defined only if Randall is still present? Actually, if Randall is fired in year t0, then for t>=t0+1, the count of employees worse than Randall is not meaningful? However, we are only using the recurrence to compute the conditions for each year? Actually, the condition for year t0: H[t0] < R_arr[t0] -> so we know that D0[t0] = H[t0] - R_arr[t0] < 0. Then the global min will be negative. So we output 0.

                    # Therefore, we can still compute H[t] for all t? Because the recurrence does not require Randall to be present? Actually, the recurrence is defined as the count of employees with performance < A0 (even if Randall is gone). But if Randall is gone, then the condition for the next years is irrelevant? However, the problem: we are only asked whether Randall is present at the end. So we don't actually care about the recurrence beyond the first year in which he is fired? But we have to compute the entire array D0? Actually, we don't: we only need the minimum of D0 over the M years.

                    # Therefore, we can compute:
                         D0[t-1] = H[t] - R_arr[t]   for t from 1 to M.

                    And then we update with the segment tree: the updates are additive to the suffix. Then we check the global min.

                How to compute H and D0 for the base case?
                    H[1] = F1
                    For t in [1, M]:
                        D0[t-1] = H[t] - R_arr[t]   # for year t (index t-1)
                        H[t+1] = H[t] - R_arr[t] + G_current[t]

                Then we build the segment tree for D0 (which has M elements).

        Step 5: Build a segment tree that supports:
                - Range update (adding a delta to a contiguous segment) and 
                - Query the global minimum.

        Step 6: For each query (X, Y, Z):
                Let the year = X, position = Y-1 in the B_arr[X] array.
                old_val = B_arr[X][Y-1]
                new_val = Z

                old_contrib = 1 if old_val < A0 else 0
                new_contrib = 1 if new_val < A0 else 0
                delta = new_contrib - old_contrib

                If delta is not zero:
                    Then we update the segment tree: 
                         update the segment [X, M-1] (0-indexed: because year X+1 is at index X, year X+2 at index X+1, ... year M at index M-1) by adding delta.

                    Also update G_current[X] by adding delta, and update the stored B_arr[X][Y-1] to Z.

                Then we query the global minimum of the entire segment tree (over the M elements).

                If the global minimum >= 0, then output 1.
                Else, output 0.

   But note: what if the update affects a year that is beyond M? We only have M years. So we update from index = X (which corresponds to year X+1) to M-1 (which is the last year M). If X==M, then we update [M, M-1] -> which is an empty range? So we skip.

        Therefore, we update from index = X to M-1 (0-indexed) if X <= M-1? 
            Actually, in the segment tree we have indices 0 to M-1 for the M years (year1 at index0, year2 at index1, ..., yearM at index M-1).
            How does a change in G(X) affect?
                It affects D0 for years from X+1 to M? 
                In the array D0, the element at index t-1 corresponds to year t.

                So for a change in G(X), we update the D0 values for years t from X+1 to M, which correspond to indices from (X+1-1) to (M-1) = index X to index M-1.

            Therefore, we update the segment tree from index X to M-1.

        However, if X == M, then we update from index M to M-1 -> which is an empty set. So we do nothing? That is correct: because the condition for year M is stored at index M-1, and it does not involve G(M). Then after year M, we don't have a condition? Actually, the condition for year M is computed as D0[M-1] = H[M] - R_arr[M]. Then the recurrence for H[M+1] is computed but we don't have a condition for year M+1? We only care up to year M.

        Therefore, the update for year M only affects the state after year M? but we don't have a condition for that. So we don't update anything? Correct.

        But note: the condition for year M is stored at index M-1, and we do not update it (because the update only affects the next year). So we are safe.

   However, one more issue: the recurrence for H[t] for t>X is updated? But we precomputed H and D0 without the update. Then we built the segment tree for D0. Then we update the segment tree by adding delta to the suffix. But note: the recurrence is linear and additive. So the update we are doing to the segment tree exactly corresponds to the change in the formula: for year t (with t>=X+1) we add delta to D0[t-1]. And that matches.

   Therefore, we can proceed.

   Implementation of the segment tree: 
        We'll create a segment tree that supports:
            - Range add (lazy propagation)
            - Query the global min.

   Note: the array D0 can be negative initially.

   Steps for the segment tree:

        We have an array D of M elements (D0 for the base case).

        We build a segment tree that stores the minimum value in the array and supports adding a value to a contiguous range.

   Complexity: 
        Each update: O(log M)
        Each query: O(1) if we store the global min? Actually, we can store the global min at the root and update with lazy propagation. But we are going to do a global min query? Then we can just return the root.

        Actually, we can design the segment tree to support:
            __init__(data): builds the tree in O(n)
            update(l, r, delta): update the segment [l, r] by adding delta, in O(log n)
            global_min(): return the root value? Actually, the root value might be outdated if there are lazy updates. So we design with lazy propagation that pushes when necessary? Actually, we don't need to do arbitrary queries: we only need the global min. So we can design:

            We maintain:
                tree: size 2*size, and lazy: same.

            We do:
                update_range: recursively with lazy propagation.

            Then the root stores the min of the entire array? But note: we update a contiguous suffix, and we only care about the global min. So we can do:

                We design the segment tree to support:
                    def __init__(self, data, n): ... 
                    def update(self, l, r, delta): ...   [0-indexed, inclusive of l and r]
                    def query_global(self): ...  which returns the root? But actually we have to push all? Or we can avoid by storing the lazy at the root? 

            Alternatively, we can do: 
                The root stores the min of the entire array, but we have lazy at the root? Actually, we don't push the lazy if we are not going to the children? But if we update the entire segment? Then we can update the root by adding the lazy and then the delta? 

            Actually, we design with a recursive update that pushes when necessary. Then at the end the root is updated.

            Then we can get the root value? Actually, the root is stored in tree[1] and we have lazy[1] that might be non-zero? So we must push? Alternatively, we avoid storing lazy for the root? 

            We design: 
                We do a recursive update that pushes the lazy to the children. Then we update the current node by the min of the children? 

            However, we don't need to do arbitrary queries: we only need the global min. So we can store the global min separately? That might be inefficient. Instead, we can just query the entire array? But that would be O(log n). Alternatively, we can store the root value and update it during the lazy propagation? 

            Actually, we can write a method that returns the root value? But the root value is tree[1] and we have lazy[1]? We have to account for the lazy at the root? 

            Alternatively, we can write the segment tree so that the root is always the min of the entire array? But lazy propagation requires pushing? 

            We design the segment tree with lazy propagation for range updates and then we can query the entire array in O(1) by returning tree[1]? But note: the root node might have lazy? Then we haven't applied it. So we must push the lazy? 

            Actually, we can avoid by: we don't push the lazy when we update? We push only when we break the segment? 

            How about we design the segment tree so that the update_range function returns the min for the entire segment? No, we want to update and then the global min might change.

            We can do: 
                After every update, we can do a global query that runs in O(1) if we store the global min? 

            Actually, we can store a separate variable for the global min? But that won't work because the update might be to a suffix and the global min might be in the updated part? 

            Alternatively, we can store the entire array? That is M up to 100,000, but we are building a segment tree anyway.

            We'll build a standard segment tree with lazy propagation that supports:
                update(l, r, delta) -> O(log M)
                query(l, r) -> we don't need arbitrary queries, we only need the global min. So we can have a method that returns the root value? But the root value is the min of the entire array? 

            Actually, we can have a method that returns tree[1]? But we must ensure that the lazy at the root is applied? 

            We can do: 
                We don't store lazy at the root? Actually, we do: we have lazy propagation that pushes the lazy to the children? Then the root is always updated? 

            However, in the update_range function, we update the current node by the lazy and then push to children? 

            Actually, we design:

                In the update_range function, if the current segment is entirely within [l, r]:
                    We apply the delta to the current node: tree[node] += delta
                    And we set lazy[node] += delta   (if the node has children, we don't update the children now)

                Then when we do a query, we push the lazy? But we don't have queries? We only need the global min? 

            We can have a method to get the global min without pushing? It's stored at the root? But the root might have lazy? 

            Actually, the root might have lazy? Then the value at the root is already updated? Because in our update_range, when we update the entire segment (the root segment) we update tree[1] by adding delta, and we set lazy[1] for the children? But then the root value is the min for the entire array? 

            However, the root value is updated: we did tree[node] += delta. So the root value is correct? 

            But then the children? They are not updated, but we don't need them until we do a query that breaks? 

            But we are only going to do a global min query: so we return tree[1]? 

            However, if we update a suffix that is the entire array? Then we update the root and the root value is the min of the entire array? 

            But if we update a suffix that is not the entire array, then we break the segment and push? Then the root value is updated by the min of the two children? 

            Therefore, the root value is always the min of the entire array? 

            How? 
                After we update a segment that is not the entire array, we push the lazy to the children and then update the children, and then the root becomes min(left, right). 

            Therefore, after update_range, the root value is the min of the entire array? 

            So we can have:
                seg_tree = SegmentTree(D0, M)
                Then for each update: 
                    seg_tree.update(X, M-1, delta)   # 0-indexed: from index X to M-1.
                Then min_val = seg_tree.tree[1]   ? 

            However, the lazy propagation: the root might have lazy? Actually, we do not store lazy at the root? We store lazy at every node. And the root value is updated? 

            Actually, in the update_range function, we do:
                if the current segment is entirely in [l, r]:
                    tree[node] += delta
                    lazy[node] += delta   (if node is not leaf, then we set lazy for the children to be applied later? Actually, we set lazy for the node? Then when we query the children, we push? 

            But if we only care about the root, then after update_range we don't push? 

            However, the root value is updated: we added delta to the entire segment, so the min of the entire segment is increased by delta? Then we set tree[node] += delta and we set lazy[node] = ...? Actually, we set lazy[node] for the children? But the root value is the min of the entire segment? And we just added delta to the entire segment, so the min becomes min_old + delta? Then we update the root value by adding delta? 

            Then the root value is correct? 

            But if the segment is not the entire segment? Then we break the segment and update the children? Then the root value is updated as min(left.tree, right.tree) after we push? 

            Therefore, after the update_range function, the root value is the min of the entire array? 

            Actually, the segment tree is built so that the root value is the min of the entire array? 

            So we can store the root value? 

            However, we have a method: 
                seg_tree.global_min() -> return seg_tree.tree[1]

            But note: we have lazy in the root? Actually, we don't store lazy for the root? 

            In our update_range function, we do:

                if l <= segL and segR <= r:
                    self.apply(node, delta)   # which does: tree[node] += delta, and if node < size (i.e., not leaf) then lazy[node] += delta? 

            Then the root is node 1, which is not a leaf? Then we set lazy[1] += delta? 

            Then the root value tree[1] = old_tree[1] + delta? That is correct for the entire array? 

            But then the children? They are not updated. But we don't need to update them until we update a sub-segment? 

            However, when we do a subsequent update that breaks the root? Then we push the lazy? 

            But if we only care about the root value? Then we have to know that the root value is the min of the entire array? It is: because the entire array was updated by adding delta? So the min of the entire array is the old min plus delta? 

            Therefore, we can simply return tree[1] for the global min? 

            However, if we do multiple updates? Then the lazy at the root might accumulate? 

            Example: 
                First update: entire array: we set tree[1] += delta1, and lazy[1] = delta1 (because it's not a leaf? but we don't push the lazy to the children? Then the children are outdated? 

            Then if we do a second update that is only a part? Then we break the root: we push the lazy to the children? Then the root value becomes min( left_child+delta1, right_child+delta1 )? 

            Actually, we don't? 

            We design the update_range:

                We start at the root. We see the current segment [0, size-1] is entirely in [l, r]? Then we update the root: 
                    tree[1] += delta
                    lazy[1] += delta   (if we are going to update the children later, we don't update now)

                Then we do nothing to the children? 

            Then if we do a subsequent update that is a sub-segment? We break the root: we push the lazy to the children? 

                push(node):
                    apply(2*node, lazy[node])
                    apply(2*node+1, lazy[node])
                    lazy[node] = 0

            Then the children are updated? 

            Then we update the sub-segment? 

            Then the root value is updated as min(tree[2], tree[3])? 

            So the root value is the min? 

            Therefore, after every update_range, the root value (tree[1]) is the min of the entire array? 

            Therefore, we can have:

                class SegmentTree:
                    ... 
                    def global_min(self):
                        return self.tree[1]

            However, note: we are updating the tree with lazy propagation, and the root value is always updated? 

            But if we never break the root? Then the children are not updated? But the root value is updated? 

            Actually, the root value is updated by the delta for the entire array? So the min of the entire array is the old min plus the total delta we have applied to the entire array? 

            Therefore, we can use tree[1] as the global min? 

            But caution: the segment tree we built is for the entire array? 

            Therefore, we design the segment tree as above.

   Let's code accordingly.

   Special case: M=0 -> then we have no years, so we output 1 for every scenario.

   Let's run the sample:

        Sample: "5 3 3" and initial array [50,40,30,20,10] -> A0=50, F1 = count of <50: 4 (40,30,20,10).

        Year1: R1=4, B1=[1,2,3,100] -> G1 = count of <50: 3 (1,2,3) -> then H[1]=4 -> D0[0] = 4-4 = 0.
        Then H[2] = 4-4+3 = 3.
        Year2: R2=1, B2=[4] -> G2 = 1 (4<50) -> D0[1] = 3-1 = 2.
        Then H[3] = 3-1+1 = 3.
        Year3: R3=2, B3=[6,7] -> G3 = 0 -> D0[2] = 3-2 = 1.

        Then D0 = [0,2,1] -> global min=0 -> condition holds? Then Randall survives? 

        But the sample first scenario: update (1,3,300) -> change B1[3] (which is the 4th element? but note: the list B1 is [1,2,3,100] -> index3 (0-indexed) from 100 to 300.
            old_contrib: 100<50? false -> 0.
            new_contrib: 300<50? false -> 0 -> delta=0 -> no update.

        Then output: 1.

        Second scenario: update (2,1,400) -> change B2[0] from 4 to 400.
            old_contrib: 4<50 -> 1
            new_contrib: 400<50 -> 0 -> delta = -1.
            Then we update the segment tree for indices from X=2 to M-1 (which is index2? because M=3, so indices: 0,1,2) -> update index2? 
            Then D0 becomes: [0, 2, 1-1 = 0] -> global min=0 -> output 1? But sample output is 0.

        Why? 

        Let me recompute for the second scenario:

            After the first scenario, we have the base D0 = [0,2,1] and we did no update for the first scenario (because delta=0). 

            Then we update the second year: 
                Year2: G2 becomes 0 (because we changed 4 to 400, which is not <50). Then we update the suffix: year3 (index2) by -1 -> D0[2] becomes 0.

            Then the D0 array: [0,2,0] -> min=0 -> we output 1? 

        But the sample output for the second scenario is 0? 

        What's happening? 

        Actually, in the sample explanation for the second scenario:

            After year1: employees = [300,100,50,2,1] -> Randall (50) is still there.
            Year2: we replace the worst employee? The worst is 1? Then we remove 1 and add 400? Then the employees become: [300,100,50,400,2]? 
                    But wait: the worst is 1, then the next worst is 2? Then we remove one employee: the worst one? Then we add 400? 
                    Then the new set: we remove 1, then add 400 -> then we have [300,100,50,2,400]? Then we sort: [2,50,100,300,400]? 

            Actually, the problem: the worst employees are the smallest. After year1: the employees are: 
                    [300, 100, 50, 2, 1] -> sorted: [1,2,50,100,300]
            Then we remove the worst 1 employee: remove 1 -> then we add 400 -> then we have [2,50,100,300,400]. 
            Then year3: we remove the worst 2 employees: 2 and 50 -> so Randall (50) is removed.

            Therefore, Randall is removed in year3? 

            How does this show in our D0 array?

            For year3: 
                At the start of year3: we have employees: [2,50,100,300,400] -> worse than Randall (50): only 2 -> so H[3]=1.
                Then D0[2] = H[3] - R3 = 1 - 2 = -1.

            How did we compute H[3] in our base? 
                H[1]=4
                Year1: H[2]=4-4+3=3
                Year2: H[3]=3-1+? 
                    We originally had G2=1 (for the employee 4) -> but we updated to 400 -> so G2 becomes 0.
                Then H[3]=3-1+0=2 -> then D0[2]=2-2=0? 

            Why the discrepancy? 

            The issue: the recurrence for H[t] is defined as the count of employees worse than Randall at the start of year t. 

            After year1: we have [300,100,50,2,1] -> worse than 50: 2 and 1 -> so F(2)=2? 

            But we computed H[2]=3? 

            How did we get 3? 
                H[2] = H[1] - R1 + G1 = 4 - 4 + 3 = 3.

            Why 3? 
                We removed 4 worst: which were [1,2,50?] -> wait, no: the initial set: [50,40,30,20,10] -> sorted: [10,20,30,40,50]. 
                Then we remove the worst 4: [10,20,30,40] -> then we add [1,2,3,100] -> then the new set: [1,2,3,100,50] -> sorted: [1,2,3,50,100]. 
                Then the worse than 50: 1,2,3 -> 3. 

            But the sample explanation for the first scenario says: 
                "At the end of the first year, 4 worst-performing employees are replaced by employees with performance [300,100,2,1]. Therefore, the performance of the employees is [300,100,50,2,1]."

            Why did we get [1,2,3,50,100] in our calculation? 

            The problem: the initial array: [50,40,30,20,10] -> the worst are 10,20,30,40 -> remove these and add [1,2,3,100] -> then the new set: 
                We have the remaining: 50 and then the new ones: 1,2,3,100 -> then we have [50,1,2,3,100] -> but then we must sort? The problem does not say we sort? 

            Actually, the company has a set of employees. The worst employees are the smallest. So when we remove the worst 4, we remove the 4 smallest: 10,20,30,40. Then we add the new employees: [1,2,3,100]. Then the new set is the remaining employee (50) and the new ones: {1,2,3,100}. Then the entire set: {50,1,2,3,100}. Then sorted: [1,2,3,50,100]. 

            But the sample explanation: [300,100,50,2,1] -> which is the same as [1,2,50,100,300]? 

            Why 300? 

            The sample input for the first year: "4 1 2 3 100" -> then the sample explanation changed the third element to 300: so becomes [1,2,300,100]? 

            Actually, the sample input: 
                "4 1 2 3 100" -> then the update: "1 3 300" -> so the new B1 becomes [1,2,300,100]? 

            Then the new set: remove [10,20,30,40] and add [1,2,300,100] -> then the set is [50,1,2,300,100] -> sorted: [1,2,50,100,300]. 

            Then the count of worse than 50: 1 and 2 -> 2.

            Therefore, G1 = 2 (not 3).

            Then H[2] = 4 - 4 + 2 = 2.

            Then D0[0] = 4-4=0 -> condition holds for year1.
            Then year2: R2=1 -> D0[1] = H[2]-R2 = 2-1=1 -> condition holds.
            Then H[3]=2-1+? 
                Year2: we remove the worst 1 employee from [1,2,50,100,300] -> the worst is 1 -> remove 1 -> then we add 4 (in the base) -> but then the new set: [2,50,100,300,4] -> sorted: [2,4,50,100,300] -> then worse than 50: 2 and 4 -> 2? 
                But we originally computed G2=1? 

            Then after update: we change the new employee in year2 from 4 to 400 -> then we add 400 -> then the new set: [2,50,100,300,400] -> sorted: [2,50,100,300,400] -> worse than 50: only 2 -> so G2 becomes 0.

            Then H[3]=2-1+0=1.

            Then D0[2] = 1-2 = -1 -> condition fails.

            Therefore, our base for the sample:

                F1=4
                Year1: R1=4, B1=[1,2,300,100] -> G1 = 2 (because 1 and 2 are <50, 300 and 100 are not)
                Year2: R2=1, B2=[400] -> G2 = 0 (because 400>=50)   [after update in the second scenario]
                Year3: R3=2, B3=[6,7] -> G3=0.

                Then we compute:
                    H[1]=4
                    D0[0]=4-4=0
                    H[2]=4-4+2=2
                    D0[1]=2-1=1
                    H[3]=2-1+0=1
                    D0[2]=1-2=-1.

            Then global min = -1 -> output 0.

            How did we get the base in our code? 
                We read the initial B1=[1,2,3,100] -> then we computed G1 = count of <50: 1,2,3 -> 3? 
                Then we updated the first scenario: which changed the third element (which is 3) to 300 -> then we update: 
                    old_val=3 -> old_contrib=1 (because 3<50)
                    new_val=300 -> new_contrib=0 -> delta=-1.
                Then we update the segment tree for years from X=1 to M-1 (indices 0 to 2) by adding -1? 
                Then the base D0 we precomputed was [0, (4-4+3=3 -> then 3-1=2, then 3-1+? ...] 

            We must precompute the base without the updates? Then we apply the updates as we go? 

            Actually, we precomputed the base D0 with the initial B_arr. Then the first update (first scenario) is applied: 
                For the first query: (X=1, Y=3, Z=300) -> we update B_arr[1][2] from 3 to 300 -> then we compute delta = (300<50?0) - (3<50?1) = -1.
                Then we update the segment tree: indices from 1 to M-1? (0-indexed: index0 for year1, index1 for year2, index2 for year3) -> but we don't update index0? 
                    We update indices from X=1 (meaning index1 and index2) -> because the update is for year1, so it affects years 2 and 3? 

                Then the base D0 was: 
                    D0_base = [0, 2, 1]   (from the initial precomputation: 
                        year1: D0[0]=4-4=0
                        year2: D0[1]= (4-4+3) - 1 = 3-1=2
                        year3: D0[2]= (3-1+1) - 2 = 3-2=1
                    Then we update: add -1 to indices1 and 2 -> then D0 becomes [0, 2-1=1, 1-1=0] -> global min=0 -> output 1.

            Then the second scenario: 
                (X=2, Y=1, Z=400) -> update B_arr[2][0] from 4 to 400 -> delta = (400<50?0) - (4<50?1) = -1.
                Then we update: from X=2 to M-1 (which is index2) -> add -1 to index2 -> then D0 becomes [0,1,0-1=-1] -> global min=-1 -> output 0.

            This matches.

        Therefore, the algorithm:

            Precomputation:
                F1 = count of initial employees < A0.

                R_arr[1..M] and B_arr[1..M] (as lists) and G_current[1..M] = [ count for B_i ]

                Then compute an array H of length M+1: 
                    H[1] = F1
                    For t from 1 to M:
                        H[t+1] = H[t] - R_arr[t] + G_current[t]

                Then D0 (for years 1..M) is an array of M elements: 
                    D0[t-1] = H[t] - R_arr[t]   for t in [1, M]

            Build a segment tree (min) that supports:
                update(l, r, delta): update the segment [l, r] (0-indexed) by adding delta.
                global_min(): return the min value of the entire array.

            Then for each query:
                (X, Y, Z):
                    old_val = B_arr[X][Y-1]
                    new_val = Z
                    old_contrib = 1 if old_val < A0 else 0
                    new_contrib = 1 if new_val < A0 else 0
                    delta = new_contrib - old_contrib

                    if delta != 0:
                         update the segment tree: 
                             l_index = X   (because we update years from X+1 to M, which correspond to indices X to M-1) -> so update [X, M-1] by delta.
                         update G_current[X] += delta
                         update B_arr[X][Y-1] = Z

                    min_val = seg_tree.global_min()

                    if min_val >= 0:
                         print(1)
                    else:
                         print(0)

        Note: if M==0, then we skip building the segment tree and for every query output 1.

   Let's test the sample step-by-step:

        Initial base for D0: 
            Year1: H1=4 -> D0[0]=4-4=0.
            Year2: H2=4-4+3=3 -> D0[1]=3-1=2.
            Year3: H3=3-1+0=2? -> but wait, the new employees in year3: [6,7] -> G3=0? -> H3=3-1+0=2 -> then D0[2]=2-2=0? 
            Actually, we have the initial B3: [6,7] -> both are above 50? so G3=0.

            Then D0_base = [0,2,0] -> but the sample base after the first update becomes [0,2,1]? 

            Why? 

            The initial B1 was [1,2,3,100] -> then we updated the third element to 300 -> so G1 becomes 2? Then we update the segment tree: indices [1,2] (because X=1) by -1 -> so D0_base becomes:
                index0: 0
                index1: 2-1=1
                index2: 0-1=-1? 

            But then the second update: for year2, we update the first element of B2 from 4 to 400 -> then we update the segment tree for indices [2,2] by -1 -> then index2 becomes -1-1=-2.

            Then the global min=-2 -> output 0? 

            But the sample output for the first scenario is 1 and for the second is 0? 

            How do we get the first scenario to be 1? 

            After the first update (changing the third element of year1 from 3 to 300), we have:
                G1: originally 3, then becomes 3-1=2? 
                Then we recompute H for the base? We don't, we use the segment tree update: we subtract 1 from the suffix starting at index1 (year2 and year3) -> so D0_base becomes:
                    D0_base = [0, 2-1=1, 0-1=-1] -> then global min=-1 -> output 0? 

            But expected first scenario output is 1.

            What is the correct D0 for the first scenario?

                After updating the first scenario, we have:
                    Year1: H1=4 -> D0[0]=4-4=0 -> condition holds.
                    Then we compute H2: 4-4+2 (because now G1=2) = 2.
                    Then D0[1]=2-1=1 -> condition holds.
                    Then H3=2-1+? 
                         Year2: we remove 1 employee -> worst employee in the set at the start of year2: the set is [1,2,50,100,300] -> the worst is 1 -> remove 1 -> then we add 4 (which is <50) -> so the new set: [2,50,100,300,4] -> worse than 50: 2 and 4 -> 2.
                    Then H3=2-1+? -> but the new employees in year2: we added one employee: 4 -> so G2=1? 
                    Then H3=2-1+1=2.
                    Then D0[2]=2-2=0 -> condition holds.

                Then D0 = [0,1,0] -> min=0 -> output 1.

            How do we get this in the segment tree? 
                We start with base D0 (with the initial B1=[1,2,3,100] -> G1=3, then base D0: 
                    D0[0]=0
                    D0[1]= (4-4+3) - 1 = 3-1=2
                    D0[2]= (3-1+? ) -> for year2: we have G2=1 (because the initial B2=[4] -> so 4<50 ->1) -> then H3=3-1+1=3 -> then D0[2]=3-2=1.

                Then we update the first scenario: 
                    We update year1: change the third element to 300 -> then G1 becomes 2 -> so we update the segment tree for years from 1 to 2 (indices1 to 2) by delta = (0-1) = -1.
                    Then D0 becomes: 
                         index0: 0
                         index1: 2-1=1
                         index2: 1-1=0.

                Then global min=0 -> output 1.

            Then the second scenario: 
                We update year2: change the first element from 4 to 400 -> then G2 becomes 0 -> so we update the segment tree for years from 2 to 2 (index2) by delta = (0-1) = -1.
                Then D0 becomes: 
                         index0: 0
                         index1: 1
                         index2: 0-1=-1.
                Then global min=-1 -> output 0.

            Therefore, we must precompute the base D0 with the initial B_arr (without the updates) and then apply the updates as they come (each query) by updating the segment tree.

        Therefore, the base D0 in the sample is computed as:
            H[1]=4
            D0[0] = 4-4 = 0
            H[2] = 4-4+3 = 3
            D0[1] = 3-1 = 2
            H[3] = 3-1+1 = 3   # because the initial B2 is [4] -> G2=1
            D0[2] = 3-2 = 1

        Then the segment tree is built on [0,2,1].

        Then the first query: (1,3,300) -> 
            old_val = 3 -> old_contrib=1
            new_val=300 -> new_contrib=0 -> delta=-1
            Update segment [1,2] (0-indexed: indices1 and 2) by -1 -> then the array becomes [0, 1, 0] -> global_min=0 -> output 1.

        Then update the stored arrays: 
            B_arr[1] becomes [1,2,300,100] 
            G_current[1] becomes 3-1=2.

        Then second query: (2,1,400) ->
            old_val = 4 -> old_contrib=1
            new_val=400 -> new_contrib=0 -> delta=-1
            Update segment [2,2] by -1 -> then the array becomes [0,1,0-1=-1] -> global_min=-1 -> output 0.

        Then third query: (2,1,5) -> 
            old_val=400 -> but we updated to 400? Actually, we stored 400? 
            Then we update: old_val=400 -> old_contrib=0
            new_val=5 -> new_contrib=1 -> delta=1
            Then update segment [2,2] by 1 -> then the array becomes [0,1,-1+1=0] -> global_min=0 -> output 1.

        But the sample output is:
            1
            0
            (and then the third one is not provided? The sample output only has two lines? Actually, the sample input has 3 queries? But the sample output has two outputs? 

        Actually, the sample input:

            "5 3 3"
            ... 
            "1 3 300"
            "2 1 400"
            "2 1 5"

        and the sample output:

            "1"
            "0"

        But we have three queries? The problem says: "For each scenario in the same order as input, output in a line ..."

        So we output three lines? 

        The sample output has two lines? 

        Actually, the sample input/output #1 is:

            Input:
                5 3 3
                50 40 30 20 10
                4 1 2 3 100
                1 4
                2 6 7
                1 3 300
                2 1 400
                2 1 5

            Output:
                1
                0

        So only two outputs? But wait, the problem says: "the next Q lines each contains ...", and Q=3, but the output has two integers? 

        Actually, the sample output has two integers? 

        Looking at the sample input: 
            After the initial data, we have 3 lines of updates.

        Then the output has two integers? 

        But the problem says: "For each scenario" -> so 3 scenarios? 

        The sample output: 
            1
            0

        And the explanation only explains two scenarios.

        Actually, the sample input has:

            Q=3, then the next 3 lines are:
                "1 3 300"
                "2 1 400"
                "2 1 5"

        Then we output:

            First scenario: 1
            Second scenario: 0
            Third scenario: ?

        But the sample output has two lines? 

        The problem statement says: "Sample Output #1: 1 0" -> meaning two lines? 

        Actually, the problem sample output is:

            1
            0

        and that's two lines? 

        And the problem says: "For each scenario in the same order as input, output in a line"

        So we output 3 lines? 

        However, the sample output only shows two? 

        But note: the problem statement says: "Sample Output #1" and then shows two lines. 

        And the explanation says: "Therefore, Randall will still be in the company after 3 years." for the first scenario and then "Therefore, Randall will not be in the company after 3 years." for the second scenario. It does not mention the third.

        But the third scenario: 
            We change (B2)_1 from 400 to 5? 
            Then we have:
                After the first scenario: we have the state after the first two queries: 
                    After the first query: we updated year1: so the base D0 was [0,2,1] and then we updated to [0,1,0] -> output 1.
                    Then the second query: updated to [0,1,-1] -> output 0.
                Then the third query: 
                    old_val=400 (from the second update) -> old_contrib=0
                    new_val=5 -> new_contrib=1 -> delta=1.
                    Then we update the segment tree: for year2 -> update indices from 2 to 2 (0-indexed index2) by 1 -> then D0[2] = -1+1=0.
                    Then the array: [0,1,0] -> min=0 -> output 1.

        Therefore, we output:
            1
            0
            1

        But the sample output is:
            1
            0

        Why? 

        The problem statement says: "Sample Input #1" and then the input, and "Sample Output #1" and then two integers.

        And the constraints: Q=3? 

        Actually, the sample input has Q=3, but the sample output only has two outputs? 

        This is a mistake? Or the problem intended to output two? 

        But the problem says: "For each scenario" -> so we output Q lines.

        Therefore, the sample should have three outputs.

        However, the problem statement says: "Sample Output #1: 1 0" -> meaning two? 

        Let me check the sample input:

            "5 3 3"
            "50 40 30 20 10"
            then the next 3 lines (M=3) for the years:
                "4 1 2 3 100"
                "1 4"
                "2 6 7"
            then the next 3 lines (Q=3) for the scenarios:
                "1 3 300"
                "2 1 400"
                "2 1 5"

        Then we output 3 lines.

        But the problem sample output is written as:

            1
            0

        which is two lines? 

        Actually, the problem says: "Sample Output #1" and then:

            ```
            1
            0
            ```

        That is two lines? 

        But wait, the problem says: "Sample Input #1" has:

            "5 3 3
            50 40 30 20 10
            4 1 2 3 100
            1 4
            2 6 7
            1 3 300
            2 1 400
            2 1 5"

        That is 7 lines. Then the output should be 3 lines? 

        The problem says: "Sample Output #1" and then two lines? 

        This is a discrepancy. 

        I see: the problem says: "Sample Input #1" and then:

            "5 3 3
            50 40 30 20 10
            4 1 2 3 100
            1 4
            2 6 7
            1 3 300
            2 1 400
            2 1 5"

        and then "Sample Output #1" and then:

            "1"
            "0"

        and then it says "Explanation for the sample input/output #1" and explains two scenarios.

        But there are three scenarios? 

        The problem says: "He will consider Q scenarios", and Q=3.

        Therefore, we output three lines.

        However, the sample output only provided two? 

        But the problem statement says: "Sample Output #1" and then two lines. 

        And the problem constraints: Q can be up to 100000, so we output Q lines.

        Therefore, for the sample, we output:
            1
            0
            1

        But the sample output in the problem is two lines? 

        This might be a typo in the problem. 

        But the problem says: "Sample Output #1" and then two integers. 

        I will output three lines for the sample.

        However, the problem sample input has three queries? 

        Therefore, we output three lines.

   Code implementation:

        We note: the total sum of R_i is <= 10^6, so reading the B arrays is efficient.

        We'll code accordingly.

        Let's code the segment tree as described.

        Note: the segment tree update: we update a contiguous segment [l, r] (0-indexed) by adding a delta.

        We use a segment tree with lazy propagation that supports range add and global min query.

        We assume M can be 0.

        Steps:

            Read N, M, Q.
            Read A (N integers)
            A0 = A[0]
            F1 = number of x in A such that x < A0.

            R_arr = [0]*(M+1)   # 1-indexed: index from 1 to M
            B_arr = [None]*(M+1) # 1-indexed
            G_current = [0]*(M+1) # 1-indexed: G_current[i] for year i

            for i in range(1, M+1):
                Read R_i = next int
                Then read R_i integers for B_i.
                G_current[i] = count of x in B_i that are < A0.

            Precomputation for H and D0 (if M>0, we do; if M==0, skip)
                H = [0]*(M+2)
                H[1] = F1
                D0 = [0]*M   # 0-indexed: D0[i] for year i+1? Actually, we want D0[0] for year1, D0[1] for year2, etc.

                For t in range(1, M+1):
                    # D0 for year t: at index t-1
                    D0[t-1] = H[t] - R_arr[t]
                    H[t+1] = H[t] - R_arr[t] + G_current[t]

            If M>0:
                seg_tree = SegmentTree(D0, M)   # builds a segment tree for an array of size M
            else:
                seg_tree = None

            Then for each of the Q queries:
                Read X, Y, Z.

                year = X, index in the B_arr[X] = Y-1.

                old_val = B_arr[X][Y-1]
                new_val = Z

                old_contrib = 1 if old_val < A0 else 0
                new_contrib = 1 if new_val < A0 else 0
                delta = new_contrib - old_contrib

                if delta != 0:
                    # update the segment tree: for years from X+1 to M -> which correspond to indices [X, M-1] (0-indexed)
                    if X <= M-1 and M>0:   # if there is any index to update: from index = X to M-1
                        seg_tree.update(X, M-1, delta)

                    # update G_current[X] and the B_arr[X][Y-1]
                    G_current[X] += delta
                    B_arr[X][Y-1] = Z

                if M == 0:
                    # no years -> Randall survives
                    out_lines.append("1")
                else:
                    min_val = seg_tree.global_min()
                    if min_val >= 0:
                        out_lines.append("1")
                    else:
                        out_lines.append("0")

        We'll implement the segment tree as described above.

        The segment tree:

            class SegmentTree:
                def __init__(self, data, n):
                    # data: list of n elements
                    self.n = n
                    self.size = 1
                    while self.size < n:
                        self.size *= 2
                    self.tree = [10**18] * (2 * self.size)
                    self.lazy = [0] * (2 * self.size)
                    # build: put data in the leaves
                    for i in range(n):
                        self.tree[self.size+i] = data[i]
                    for i in range(n, self.size):
                        self.tree[self.size+i] = 10**18
                    for i in range(self.size-1, 0, -1):
                        self.tree[i] = min(self.tree[2*i], self.tree[2*i+1])

                def apply(self, node, delta):
                    self.tree[node] += delta
                    if node < self.size:
                        self.lazy[node] += delta

                def push(self, node):
                    # push lazy to children
                    if self.lazy[node] != 0:
                        self.apply(2*node, self.lazy[node])
                        self.apply(2*node+1, self.lazy[node])
                        self.lazy[node] = 0

                def update_range(self, l, r, delta, node, segL, segR):
                    if r < segL or segR < l:
                        return
                    if l <= segL and segR <= r:
                        self.apply(node, delta)
                        return
                    self.push(node)
                    mid = (segL+segR)//2
                    self.update_range(l, r, delta, 2*node, segL, mid)
                    self.update_range(l, r, delta, 2*node+1, mid+1, segR)
                    self.tree[node] = min(self.tree[2*node], self.tree[2*node+1])

                def update(self, l, r, delta):
                    # update the segment [l, r] (0-indexed, inclusive) by adding delta
                    self.update_range(l, r, delta, 1, 0, self.size-1)

                def global_min(self):
                    return self.tree[1]

            However, note: our tree is built on the segment [0, size-1] for the entire array? 
                The leaves: indices 0 to size-1, but our actual data is only n elements, the rest are set to a big number (10**18). 

            Then the root (tree[1]) is the min of the entire array? 

            But what if the entire array is updated? Then we update the root and the root value is updated? 

            But if we update a segment that is not the entire array? Then we break and update the children? Then the root value is updated as the min of the children? 

            Therefore, after every update, the root value is the min of the entire array? 

            We can return tree[1] for global_min.

        However, we must be cautious: the segment tree covers an array of size self.size (which is at least n). The indices beyond n-1 are set to 10**18, so they won't affect the min? 

        Therefore, the global_min() returns the min of the entire array of n elements? 

        We'll test the segment tree with a small example.

        Alternatively, we can write a query function that queries the entire array? But we only need the global min, and we have the root. 

        We'll rely on the root.

   Let's run a small test for the segment tree:

        data = [1, 2, 3] -> n=3, size=4.
        tree = [0]*8
        lazy = [0]*8

        Build:
            leaves: 
                tree[4]=1, tree[5]=2, tree[6]=3, tree[7]=10**18.
            Then build the tree from the leaves:
                tree[2] = min(1,2)=1
                tree[3] = min(3,10**18)=3
                tree[1]=min(1,3)=1.

        Then update [0,1] (indices0 and 1) by 1:
            We call update_range(0,1,1,1,0,3)   # segL=0, segR=3 (the root covers [0,3])
            The root segment [0,3] is not entirely in [0,1]? 
            Then push: lazy[1] is 0 -> skip.
            Then mid=(0+3)//2=1.
            Left child: [0,1] -> which is entirely in [0,1]? 
                So we apply to node2: 
                    tree[2] = 1+1=2
                    lazy[2] = 1 (because node2 is not a leaf? node2=2, which is less than size=4 -> so set lazy[2]=1)
            Then right child: [2,3] -> not entirely in [0,1] -> 
                Then push? but the root push is done, now we are at node2? 
                Then we do the left child of node2? 

            Actually, we break the root and then update the left child and then the right child of the root? 

            Then after updating the left child (node2) and then the right child (node3) we update the root? 
                tree[1] = min(tree[2], tree[3]) = min(2,3)=2.

            Then the array becomes [2,3,3,10**18]? 

            But we updated [0,1] by 1: so [1+1,2+1,3,10**18] = [2,3,3,10**18] -> min=2.

            Then global_min returns 2.

        But we can also update [1,2] by 1: 
            Then the array becomes [2,4,4,10**18] -> min=2.

            How? 
                We start at root [0,3] -> not entirely covered -> push the root? lazy[1]=0 -> skip.
                mid=1.
                Left child: [0,1]: 
                    We update the left child? [0,1] is not entirely in [1,2] -> so break: 
                        push node2: 
                            apply to children: 
                                node4: tree[4]=tree[4]+lazy[2]=2+1=3, and set lazy[4] += lazy[2]? but node4 is a leaf -> so just update tree[4]=2+1=3? and then lazy[2]=0.
                        Then update: 
                            mid of [0,1] is 0.
                            Left child of node2: [0,0] -> not in [1,2]? skip.
                            Right child: [1,1] -> in [1,2]? 
                                Then apply to node5: tree[5]=3+1=4, and set lazy[5]? but node5 is a leaf? then we don't set lazy? 
                        Then update node2: tree[2]=min(3,4)=3.

                Then right child of root: [2,3] -> 
                    We update the left part: [2,2] -> 
                        apply to node6: tree[6]=3+1=4? 
                    Then update node3: tree[3]=min(4,10**18)=4.

                Then update root: tree[1]=min(3,4)=3.

            Then global_min=3? 

            But the min should be 3? 

            However, the array: 
                index0: 2 -> then we updated [0,1] by 1: becomes 3? 
                index1: 3 -> then we updated by 1? becomes 4? 
                index2: 3 -> then we updated by 1? becomes 4? 
                Then min=3.

            So the segment tree returns 3.

        It's correct.

   We'll run the sample in the code.

   Note: we use 10**18 as a big number? But the values in D0: 
        Initially, D0[t] = H[t]-R_t: 
            H[t] is at most: 
                H[1] = F1 <= N <= 100000.
                Then H[t+1] = H[t] - R_t + G_t, and G_t <= R_t (because it's the count of new employees that are worse, and there are R_t new employees). 
                So H[t+1] <= H[t] - R_t + R_t = H[t] -> so H[t] is nonincreasing? 
                Actually, it can be: 
                    H[1] = F1
                    H[2] = F1 - R1 + G1 -> and G1<=R1, so H[2] <= F1 -> but it could be F1 - (R1 - G1) which is nonnegative? 

            Then D0[t] = H[t] - R_t: 
                H[t] is at most 100000, and R_t at least 1, so D0[t] can be negative? 

            We set the initial tree for indices beyond n to 10**18? Then when we update, we are adding a delta (which is -1,0,1) to the values? 

            The min value we care about is the min over the actual data. 

   We'll code accordingly.

   Let's run the sample input with the code.

   We'll hope it passes.

   Note: the constraints: M, Q up to 100000, but the segment tree update is O(log M) per update, so total O(Q * log M) which is 100000*log2(100000) ~ 100000*17 = 1.7e6, which is acceptable.

   And the initial building: O(M) for the segment tree.

   We go.

   Note: the segment tree update_range function: we use recursion. We should set the recursion limit? But M up to 100000 -> the depth is about 17, so recursion is safe.

   Alternatively, we can use iterative? But recursion with depth 17 is safe.

   We'll code as above.

   Let me write the entire code accordingly.

   Note: the problem says: all integers in A, B, and Z are distinct.

   We don't need to worry about duplicates.

   We'll run the sample.

   We hope: 
        First query: output 1
        Second query: output 0
        Third query: output 1

   But the sample output only has two? 

   We'll output three.

   However, the problem sample output is two? 

   We'll assume the problem intended to output for every scenario.

   We submit the code as described.

   Note: we use sys.stdin and sys.stdout for speed.

   We hope it's efficient.

   Let's code.
