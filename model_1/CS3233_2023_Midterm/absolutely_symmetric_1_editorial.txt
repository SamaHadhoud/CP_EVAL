### Editorial
The problem requires decomposing a given \(n \times n\) matrix \(A\) into the sum of \(k\) absolutely symmetric matrices (where a matrix \(T\) is absolutely symmetric if \(|T_{i,j}| = |T_{j,i}|\) for all \(i, j\)) while minimizing \(k\). If no such decomposition exists, we should output \(-1\).

#### Key Insight
1. **Necessary Condition for Existence**: For every pair of indices \(i < j\), the sum \(A_{i,j} + A_{j,i}\) must be even. This is because each absolutely symmetric matrix contributes equally to the sums of pairs \((i,j)\) and \((j,i)\) in terms of parity. If any pair violates this condition, decomposition is impossible.
2. **Minimizing \(k\)**:
   - If the matrix \(A\) is already absolutely symmetric (i.e., \(|A_{i,j}| = |A_{j,i}|\) for all \(i, j\)), then \(k = 1\) suffices (use \(A\) itself).
   - Otherwise, \(k = 2\) is sufficient and minimal. We can decompose \(A\) into two absolutely symmetric matrices.

#### Algorithmic Approach
1. **Check for Even Sums**: For every off-diagonal pair \((i, j)\) with \(i < j\), verify that \(A_{i,j} + A_{j,i}\) is even. If any pair fails this check, output \(-1\).
2. **Check for Absolute Symmetry**: If for all \(i, j\), \(|A_{i,j}| = |A_{j,i}|\), then \(A\) is absolutely symmetric. Output \(k = 1\) and the matrix \(A\).
3. **Decompose into Two Matrices**: If \(A\) is not absolutely symmetric, output \(k = 2\) and construct two matrices \(X_1\) and \(X_2\) as follows:
   - **Matrix \(X_1\) (Antisymmetric for Off-Diagonals)**:
     - For diagonal entries (\(i = j\)): Set to \(0\).
     - For off-diagonal entries (\(i \neq j\)): Set \(X_{1_{i,j}} = (A_{i,j} - A_{j,i}) / 2\).
   - **Matrix \(X_2\) (Symmetric for Off-Diagonals)**:
     - For diagonal entries (\(i = j\)): Set to \(A_{i,j}\).
     - For off-diagonal entries (\(i \neq j\)): Set \(X_{2_{i,j}} = (A_{i,j} + A_{j,i}) / 2\).
   - **Validity**: Both \(X_1\) and \(X_2\) are absolutely symmetric, and their sum equals \(A\).

#### Why This Works?
- **Existence Condition**: The even-sum condition ensures the differences and sums used in \(X_1\) and \(X_2\) are integers.
- **Minimal \(k\)**: When \(A\) is not absolutely symmetric, \(k = 1\) is impossible (since \(A\) would need to satisfy the condition itself), and \(k = 2\) is achievable with the given decomposition.
- **Handling Diagonal Entries**: The diagonal entries in \(X_1\) and \(X_2\) are set to \(0\) and \(A_{i,j}\) respectively, ensuring they sum to \(A_{i,j}\) without affecting off-diagonals.
- **Absolute Symmetry of \(X_1\) and \(X_2\)**:
  - For \(X_1\), off-diagonal entries satisfy \(|X_{1_{i,j}}| = |X_{1_{j,i}}|\) because \(X_{1_{j,i}} = -X_{1_{i,j}}\).
  - For \(X_2\), off-diagonal entries are symmetric (\(X_{2_{i,j}} = X_{2_{j,i}}\)), so the condition holds.

#### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\) for checking the even-sum condition and absolute symmetry, and constructing the output matrices. Given \(n \leq 50\), this is efficient.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\) for storing the matrices, which is within the 1024 MB limit.

#### Sample Explanations
- **Sample Input 1 (Zero Matrix)**: The matrix is absolutely symmetric, so \(k = 1\) and output the matrix itself.
- **Sample Input 2 (Non-even Sum)**: The pair \((0,1)\) has sum \(1\) (odd), so output \(-1\).
- **Sample Input 3 (Non-absolutely Symmetric)**: The matrix is not absolutely symmetric, so decompose into two matrices as described.
