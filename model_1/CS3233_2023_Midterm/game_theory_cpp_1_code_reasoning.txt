 Okay, we are going to solve the problem as described in the editorial guidelines.
 The key idea is to use dynamic programming from right to left (i.e., from cell n down to cell 1).
 We maintain two DP arrays:
   dp0[i]: the optimal score when starting at cell i and it is the maximizer's turn (the first move at cell i is by the maximizer).
   dp1[i]: the optimal score when starting at cell i and it is the minimizer's turn.

 However, note: in the problem, the starting player (when the token is placed at s) is the maximizer (you). 
 So for each starting cell s, we are interested in dp0[s].

 How do we compute?
   At cell i:
      We add a_i to the score.
      Then we choose a positive integer k that is a multiple of p_i.
      If there is a valid move (i+k <= n), then we move to cell i+k, and then the turn flips.

      Therefore, if the current state is a maximizer state (dp0[i]), then we have:
          dp0[i] = max( a_i,  a_i + (minimizer's result from the next state) )
          But note: we can choose to end the game immediately by picking k such that i+k>n, which gives a_i.
          Alternatively, we can move to j = i+k (<=n) and then the game continues from j, but now it's the minimizer's turn (so we get dp1[j]).

          So: dp0[i] = max( a_i, a_i + max_{j in moves from i} { dp1[j] } )   ??? 

      However, wait: the maximizer wants to maximize the total score. They have multiple moves. For each move j, the resulting game state j will yield a total additional score of dp1[j] (because the next move is by the minimizer). Then the entire score becomes a_i + dp1[j]. But note: the maximizer chooses the move that leads to the maximum total score. So:

          candidate = maximum value of dp1[j] for j = i + k (with k multiple of p_i) OR if there is no move then candidate doesn't exist.

          Then if there is at least one candidate move: 
              dp0[i] = max(a_i, a_i + candidate)
          But note: the maximizer might prefer to end immediately (if a_i is greater than a_i + candidate) or take the move if the candidate is positive? Actually, we have to compare the two options.

      Similarly, for the minimizer at state i (dp1[i]):

          candidate = minimum value of dp0[j] for j in moves from i.

          Then: dp1[i] = min(a_i, a_i + candidate)

      Why? The minimizer can choose to end the game and get a_i, or move to j and then the game continues as a maximizer state (so we get a_i + dp0[j]). The minimizer chooses the move that minimizes the total score.

 However, note: the problem states that after adding a_x, we choose k. Then if we can move, we move and the game continues. If we cannot (because k would take us beyond n), we end. So ending is forced if no valid move? Actually, the player can choose any k that is a multiple of p_i. They can choose a k that is too large to end the game, or a k that is within bounds to move.

      Therefore, the player has two types of moves:
          Type 1: choose k such that i+k>n -> then the game ends and the score is a_i.
          Type 2: choose k such that i+k<=n -> then the score becomes a_i + (the result from state i+k, which is of the opposite type).

      So for state i (maximizer):
          Options: all Type 1 moves yield a_i, and Type 2 moves yield a_i + dp1[j] (where j is the next state).

          Then the maximizer will choose the maximum between:
             Option 1: a_i   (by choosing a k that ends the game)
             Option 2: the maximum value of (a_i + dp1[j]) for any valid j.

          Therefore: dp0[i] = max( a_i, max_{j in moves} (a_i + dp1[j]) )

      Similarly, for state i (minimizer):
          dp1[i] = min( a_i, min_{j in moves} (a_i + dp0[j]) )

 But note: the problem says that the player first adds a_x, then chooses k. Then if k moves beyond n, the game ends. So the Type 1 move (ending) is always available? Actually, yes: the player can choose any multiple, including a huge one that makes i+k>n.

 Implementation challenge: 
   We need to efficiently, for each i, consider all j = i + k where k is a multiple of p_i and j<=n.

 How to do this without O(n) per state? 

 We note:
   The total n over test cases is 300,000, but we cannot do an O(n) for each state -> worst-case O(n^2).

 Instead, we use sqrt decomposition by step size:

   Let S = sqrt(n) (around 550 for n=300000).

   For a state i with step size d = p[i]:
      If d <= S (small step):
          We want to update and query residue classes modulo d. Specifically, we want to know the maximum dp1[j] and minimum dp0[j] for all j that are in the same residue class as i modulo d, and j>i? Actually, we traverse from right to left so j>i are already computed.

          We maintain for each modulus d (from 1 to S) and for each residue r (0<=r<d) a data structure that holds the best value for states j with j mod d = r.

          Specifically, for modulus d, we have:
             max1[d][r] = maximum dp1[j] for all j (>= current i) such that j mod d = r.
             min0[d][r] = minimum dp0[j] for all j (>= current i) such that j mod d = r.

          Then for state i, we have residue r = i mod d. Then we can get:
             candidate0 = max1[d][r]   for the maximizer: because we are looking for the best dp1[j] in the same residue? Actually, note: j must be i+k, and k is multiple of d -> then j mod d = i mod d. So indeed we are interested in the same residue.

          But note: we must only consider j that are >= i+d? Actually, our array for residue r in modulus d holds all j (to the right of i) that are in that residue. Since we traverse from n down to 1, when we are at i, we have updated j>i. So we can use the current max1[d][r] and min0[d][r] which are the best from the states j>=i (but note: j>i) in residue r.

      However, what if there is no j? Then we would have max1[d][r] = -infinity? Then we know there are no moves.

      If d > S (large step):
          Then the number of multiples is at most n/d <= sqrt(n). So we can iterate over j: j = i+d, i+2d, ... until <= n.

          Then we can iterate over these j and take:
             candidate0 = max{ dp1[j] for j = i+k (k multiple of d) and j<=n }
             candidate1 = min{ dp0[j] for j = i+k (k multiple of d) and j<=n }

          Since the number of j is O(n/d) = O(sqrt(n)), the total cost for all large steps is O(n * sqrt(n))? But note: the sum of n over test cases is 300000, but the total n is 300000? Actually, the constraint says: the sum of n over test cases <= 300000.

          However, note: worst-case, if we have many states with large d, we might do for each state i with d>S: about n/d iterations. The total cost would be: sum_{i=1}^{n} [if d_i > S then (number of multiples) ].

          The worst-case total cost for large steps: 
              = sum_{d=S+1}^{n} (number of i with p_i = d) * (n/d)

          Since the array p is a permutation? Actually, the problem states: "p_i ≠ p_j if i ≠ j" -> so p is a permutation? Actually, the problem says: "The i-th cell from the left has the number p_i written on it. ... (1<=p_i<=n; p_i ≠ p_j if i≠j)" -> so p is a permutation of [1, n].

          Therefore, each d from 1 to n appears exactly once.

          Then the total cost for large steps: 
             = sum_{d=S+1}^{n} (n/d)   [because for each d, there is exactly one i with p_i=d]

          And the harmonic sum: sum_{d=S+1}^{n} (n/d) ≈ n * (H_n - H_S) ≈ n * (ln(n) - ln(S)) = n * ln(n/S) = n * ln(sqrt(n)) = n * (0.5 * ln(n)) = O(n log n).

          But note: the total n over test cases is 300000. However, worst-case one test case n=300000, then the harmonic sum for d from 551 to 300000: 
             ≈ 300000 * (ln(300000) - ln(550)) ≈ 300000 * (12.6 - 6.3) ≈ 300000 * 6.3 ≈ 1.89e6, which is acceptable.

          But note: we have two arrays: we are going to iterate for each large step and for each state with large step we do O(sqrt(n)) iterations. Since there are about n - S ≈ 300000 states with large step? Actually, no: there is exactly one state per d. And d from S+1 to n: about 300000 - 550 states? That is about 299450 states? Then the total operations would be about 1.89e6? But note: we are iterating for each large step value (each d) only once? Actually, no: we are iterating for each cell i that has p_i = d (which is one per d). And for each such cell i, we iterate over j = i+d, i+2d, ... until exceeding n.

          However, note: the total work for large steps is: 
             total_work = 0
             for d from S+1 to n:
                 for j = i0 + d, i0+2d, ... <= n:   [where i0 is the index i for which p_i = d]
                 the number of iterations is floor((n - i0) / d) <= n/d.

          And then we sum over d: total_work <= sum_{d=S+1}^{n} (n/d) = n * (H_n - H_S) ≈ 300000 * (ln(300000) - ln(550)) ≈ 300000 * (12.6 - 6.3) = 300000 * 6.3 = 1,890,000, which is acceptable.

   Therefore, we design:

      Precomputation:
          Let S = ceil(sqrt(300000)) -> we set S=550.

      For each test case:
          n, p[0..n-1], a[0..n-1]

          We create:
             dp0[1..n] and dp1[1..n] (indexed from 1 to n)

          We create two global arrays for small moduli (d from 1 to S):
             max1[d]: an array of length d, initialized to -10**18 (a very small number) for each residue 0..d-1.
             min0[d]: an array of length d, initialized to 10**18 (a very big number) for each residue 0..d-1.

          Then we iterate i from n down to 1:

             Let d = p[i-1] (since the cell i has value p[i-1] in the input)

             If d <= S:
                 residue = i % d   [but note: we index from 1: so for modulus d, residue r from 0 to d-1. However, i mod d might be 0? Then we use r = i % d, but if that is 0, we use residue 0? Actually, in modulo, 0 is the residue class for multiples. But note: we are going to consider j such that j mod d = i mod d. So we use r = i % d, and if it is 0 we set residue=0? Actually, modulo operation in programming: i % d gives the residue in [0, d-1].]

                 Then we look at max1[d][residue] and min0[d][residue]:
                    If max1[d][residue] is still -10**18, then there is no state j>i with j mod d = residue? Then we have no move? Actually, we might have updated some states, but if we haven't then we treat as no candidate.

                 So:
                    candidate0 = max1[d][residue]   [if max1[d][residue] is -inf, then no move?]
                    candidate1 = min0[d][residue]   [if min0[d][residue] is inf, then no move?]

                 But note: we have updated states j>i? And we are processing from n down to 1, so when at i, we have updated states j>i. So if max1[d][residue] is -inf, then there is no state j>i in that residue? Then we have no valid move.

                 Then:
                    if candidate0 is -inf (meaning no candidate found): then we set:
                         dp0[i] = a_i
                         dp1[i] = a_i
                    else:
                         dp0[i] = max(a_i, a_i + candidate0)   [because maximizer: either end (a_i) or take the best move (a_i + candidate0) if that is bigger]
                         dp1[i] = min(a_i, a_i + candidate1)

             Else (d > S):
                 We iterate j = i+d, i+2d, ... until j<=n.

                 We want:
                    candidate0 = max{ dp1[j] for j in the multiples }   [if any exists]
                    candidate1 = min{ dp0[j] for j in the multiples }   [if any exists]

                 If we found at least one j:
                    dp0[i] = max(a_i, a_i + candidate0)
                    dp1[i] = min(a_i, a_i + candidate1)
                 Else (no j found, meaning no moves):
                    dp0[i] = a_i
                    dp1[i] = a_i

             Then, regardless of d, we update the small modulus arrays for every modulus d' from 1 to S:

                 For each modulus d' in [1, S]:
                     residue = i % d'
                     Then update:
                         max1[d'][residue] = max(max1[d'][residue], dp1[i])
                         min0[d'][residue] = min(min0[d'][residue], dp0[i])

          However, note: updating every modulus d' from 1 to S for every i would be O(S) per state -> total O(n*S) ≈ 300000 * 550 = 165e6, which might be borderline in Pyton but in C++ it should be acceptable? But the problem says the total n over test cases is 300000. Actually, the constraint: "the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 300000", meaning we have one test case with n=300000? Actually, no: it says the sum of n. So worst-case: one test case with n=300000. Then the total operations for updating the small modulus arrays would be 300000 * 550 = 165e6, which in C++ is acceptable? Actually, 165e6 operations is acceptable in C++ (about 0.5 seconds?).

          But note: we are iterating over d' from 1 to S (which is 550) for each i -> 300000 * 550 = 165,000,000 operations per test case. And the constraint says the total n over test cases <= 300000, meaning the worst-case is one test case with n=300000. Then 165e6 operations is acceptable? Actually, we must be cautious: the constant might be heavy.

          Alternatively, we note: we only update for d' from 1 to S (550) per state, and we have n=300000 states -> 300000 * 550 = 165e6, which is acceptable in C++ (if we use fast loops and no heavy operations). We are just doing two comparisons per modulus.

          But note: we have to initialize the arrays for each test case? The arrays for modulus d from 1 to S: we can preallocate for each d in [1, S] an array of length d. Since S=550, the total memory is about 1+2+...+550 ≈ 550*551/2 ≈ 150000 integers per test case? And we have at most 300000 total n, but the test cases: the number of test cases C is at most 300000? But the constraint: the sum of n over test cases is 300000, so the maximum n per test case is 300000, and the number of test cases C can be up to 300000? Actually, the constraint: C>=1 and the sum of n<=300000. So worst-case: 300000 test cases each with n=1 -> then n_total=300000. Then we would do 300000 test cases, each with n=1.

          How do we handle the arrays for small moduli? We can have a global structure? But each test case must be independent.

          Alternatively, we can precompute for each modulus d in [1, S] an array of length d for the entire program? But then we must reset for each test case.

          We can do:

             For each test case, we create:
                 max1 = vector of vectors: for d in [1, S], we have a vector of d elements, initialized to a very small number (like -10**18) for each residue.
                 min0 = similarly, a vector of vectors: for d in [1, S], vector of d elements, initialized to a very big number.

          However, the total memory for the small modulus arrays is about 150000 integers per test case? But if we have 300000 test cases (each n=1) then the total memory for small modulus arrays would be 300000 * (number of vectors for d=1..S) * (each vector size) -> but note: the vectors are of fixed sizes (d for each d in [1, S]) and the total memory for one test case is about 150000 integers. Then 300000 test cases would use 300000 * 150000 * sizeof(long long) = 300000 * 150000 * 8 bytes? That is 360,000,000,000 bytes (360 GB) which is too much.

          Therefore, we must avoid creating the small modulus arrays for each test case independently if we have many test cases.

          Instead, we note: the constraint says the sum of n over test cases <= 300000. So the total number of states (over all test cases) is <= 300000. However, we are iterating over each state and updating the small modulus arrays for d' from 1 to S. And the total number of states is 300000. Then the total operations for updating small modulus arrays over all test cases is 300000 * S = 300000 * 550 = 165e6, which is acceptable.

          But the problem: we must initialize the arrays for small moduli for each test case. How to do that without using too much memory?

          We can precompute the total memory needed for the small modulus arrays for one test case: about (1+2+...+S) integers. Since S=550, that is 550*551/2 = 151525 integers. Then for 300000 test cases? That would be 300000 * 151525 integers = 45,457,500,000 integers -> which is 45.5 billion integers? That is 45.5 * 4 bytes? Actually, no: we have two arrays (max1 and min0) so that doubles? And we are storing long long? Then 45.5 billion * 2 * 8 = 728 GB? That is too much.

          We must avoid creating the arrays for each test case if there are many test cases.

          Instead, we note: the constraint says the sum of n over test cases <= 300000, so the maximum n per test case might be large but the total n is 300000. And the number of test cases C can be up to 300000? Actually, the first integer C is the number of test cases, and the constraint says 1<=C<=300000 and the sum of n over test cases <=300000. So worst-case: 300000 test cases, each with n=1. Then we have 300000 test cases.

          How to handle the small modulus arrays? We cannot create 300000 * 151525 integers.

          Alternative: we do not preallocate the arrays for each test case? Instead, we create a single set of arrays for the entire test case? And we reuse the same arrays for the entire test case? But we must reset the arrays for each test case.

          We can have a global array for max1 and min0 for each modulus d? But we have to reset them for each test case. The total memory for one test case for small moduli is about 150000 integers. Then if we have 300000 test cases, we cannot store 300000 copies.

          Instead, we can avoid storing the arrays per test case and reset them without reallocating? We can create the arrays for small moduli once (for the entire program) and then for each test case, we reset them to -inf and inf? But note: the sizes of the arrays for each modulus d are fixed (d elements). So we can have:

             vector<vector<long long>> global_max1(S+1); // index from 1 to S
             vector<vector<long long>> global_min0(S+1); // index from 1 to S

          Then for each test case, we reset each vector for d in [1, S] to have d elements, each set to -10**18 for max1 and 10**18 for min0.

          How to reset? We can do:

             for d in range(1, S+1):
                 global_max1[d].assign(d, NEG_INF);
                 global_min0[d].assign(d, POS_INF);

          The cost of resetting: for d from 1 to S, we assign d elements -> total cost per test case: 1+2+...+S = S*(S+1)/2 ≈ 550*551/2 = 151525 per test case.

          Then for 300000 test cases, the total reset cost would be 300000 * 151525 = 45,457,500,000 assignments? That is 45.5 billion assignments -> too slow.

          We need a better way.

          How about we do not preallocate the arrays for each test case? Instead, we note that the total n over test cases is 300000. And we are going to iterate over states from n down to 1 for each test case. The total states is 300000. Then the total operations for the entire program (over all test cases) for updating the small modulus arrays is 300000 * 550 = 165e6? Actually, no: each state in each test case we update for d' from 1 to S (550 moduli) -> the total operations is (total states) * S = 300000 * 550 = 165e6.

          But we must initialize the arrays for small moduli for each test case. How to do it without resetting the entire array (which is 151525 per test case) for each test case?

          Instead, we can avoid resetting the entire array? We can use a lazy technique? Or we can use a timestamp? 

          Alternatively, we note: we are iterating the states from n down to 1. The arrays for small moduli are used only for the current test case. Then we can create the arrays once at the beginning of the test case and then destroy them at the end? But the problem is that if we have 300000 test cases, we create and destroy 300000 times an array of 151525 integers? The creation cost per test case is 151525, which for 300000 test cases is 45.5 billion integers? That is 45.5e9 integers, which is 364 GB for long long? That is too much.

          We must optimize the memory.

          Idea: We note that the total states over test cases is 300000. Therefore, we can avoid storing the arrays for small moduli per test case? Instead, we can simulate without the arrays? Actually, no.

          Alternatively, we can avoid updating the arrays for small moduli for the entire test case? Actually, we need the arrays for the current test case to store the best values for residues for each modulus d in [1, S] for the states j that have been processed (which are to the right of the current state i).

          How about we do:

             We create two arrays: 
                 max1_arr = vector of vectors of size (S+1) -> for d in [1, S] we have a vector of length d, initialized to NEG_INF (for max1) and INF for min0.

             Then we process the states in the test case from n down to 1.

             After processing a state i, we update for every modulus d in [1, S]:
                 residue = i % d
                 max1_arr[d][residue] = max(max1_arr[d][residue], dp1[i])
                 min0_arr[d][residue] = min(min0_arr[d][residue], dp0[i])

          And at the beginning of the test case, we initialize the arrays for d in [1, S] to the initial values (NEG_INF and INF).

          Then the memory per test case is about 151525 * 2 * sizeof(long long) = 151525 * 16 bytes? = about 2.4 MB per test case.

          Then for 300000 test cases, worst-case 300000 test cases, the total memory would be 300000 * 2.4 MB = 720,000 MB = 720 GB -> too much.

          Therefore, we cannot store the arrays per test case if we have 300000 test cases.

          We must note: the constraint says the total n (over test cases) is 300000. So worst-case: 300000 test cases each with n=1. Then we can avoid creating the arrays for small moduli for test cases that have n=1? Actually, we need the arrays for the entire test case? But note: we are processing one test case at a time. We can create the arrays for small moduli for the current test case and then destroy them at the end of the test case.

          However, the memory for one test case: 2.4 MB. The total memory over test cases: 300000 * 2.4 MB = 720 GB -> too high.

          Alternative: we do not use the arrays for small moduli if the test case has n=1? Actually, we need them for every test case.

          How about we avoid storing the arrays for small moduli for test cases that do not have any state? Actually, we have to create them for each test case.

          We need a different approach: we note that the total n (the number of states) over test cases is 300000. Then the total number of states we process is 300000. Therefore, we can avoid the sqrt decomposition by step size? 

          Actually, we can use a different technique for the entire problem: use a Fenwick tree or segment tree? But the moves are not contiguous.

          Alternatively, we can avoid storing the entire arrays for small moduli per test case by using a different representation: we store a global array for each modulus d? But then we must reset for the next test case? 

          We can create the arrays for small moduli once (for the entire program) and then for each test case we reset only the necessary residues? How?

          We note: during the processing of a test case, we update the arrays for small moduli for every state. Then at the end of the test case, we need to reset the arrays to the initial state (NEG_INF and INF) for the next test case.

          How to reset quickly? We can store for each modulus d and residue r the last test case that updated it? Then we don't know. 

          Alternatively, we can store the arrays and then reset by iterating over every residue? The total residues is about 151525 per test case? Then the total reset cost over all test cases is 300000 * 151525 = 45.5e9, which is about 45.5 billion operations? That is too slow.

          We need a solution that does not use per-test-case arrays for small moduli.

          Another idea: we do not precompute the arrays for small moduli? Instead, for each state i, we iterate over divisors of i? Actually, that is not the direction.

          Alternatively, we can use a different technique: use offline queries? 

          Actually, we can avoid the small modulus arrays by processing the large steps and then for small steps we use direct iteration? But then the small steps (d<=S) would be iterated over the multiples? Then the cost per state with small step: O(n/d) which is O(n) worst-case -> worst-case total cost O(n^2) which is too high.

          Therefore, we must use the residue arrays for small steps.

          Considering the constraints: the total n over test cases is 300000, and the worst-case one test case with n=300000, then we can create the arrays for small moduli for that test case: 2.4 MB. Then if there are multiple test cases, the total memory is the number of test cases * 2.4 MB. But the total n is 300000, so the number of test cases C is at most 300000? Actually, worst-case: 300000 test cases, each with n=1 -> then the total memory would be 300000 * 2.4 MB = 720 GB -> too high.

          But note: the constraint says the sum of n over test cases <= 300000. Therefore, the total number of test cases C might be 300000, but the memory per test case for the small moduli arrays is 151525 * 2 * 8 = 2424400 bytes ≈ 2.4 MB. Then 300000 * 2.4 MB = 720 GB, which is too high.

          How about we not create the arrays for small moduli for test cases that have n=0? Actually, n>=1.

          Alternatively, we can avoid the arrays for small moduli by using a global array that is reused? 

          We create the arrays for small moduli once (at the beginning of the program) and then for each test case we reset them. But the reset must be efficient. We can reset the arrays for small moduli by iterating over every residue? That is 151525 per test case. Then the total reset cost over all test cases is (number of test cases) * 151525. For 300000 test cases: 300000 * 151525 = 45.5e9, which is about 45.5 billion iterations -> in C++ we hope that 45.5e9 iterations might be borderline? But 45.5e9 iterations of simple assignment might take about 45.5 seconds? (assuming 1e9 iterations per second). But the entire program must run in 1 second? Actually, the time limit is 1.0s per test case? Or overall? The problem says time limit: 1.0s -> meaning per test case? Actually, the constraint says: the sum of n over test cases is 300000, but the number of test cases can be 300000. Then 45.5 seconds is too slow.

          We need a faster reset method.

          We can use a "version" technique: we maintain a global version number and for each residue we store the last version that updated it. Then we don't need to reset? How would that work?

          We maintain for each modulus d and residue r:
             value_max1[d][r] = the current best value for residue r in modulus d for the current test case.
             timestamp_max1[d][r] = the version (test case id) when this residue was last updated.

          Then at the beginning of a test case, we do nothing. When we update a residue r in modulus d, we check the timestamp: if the timestamp is not the current test case, then we reset the value to NEG_INF and set the timestamp to the current test case, then update.

          But then we are doing lazy reset: we reset only when we access. The total number of updates over the entire program is the total number of states * S = 300000 * 550 = 165e6. And each update we do one check and possibly one reset. The reset would be done only once per residue per test case? Actually, we would reset the first time we access that residue in this test case.

          How to implement:

             We have:
                 global vector<vector<long long>> max1_value; // size: S+1, and for each d: vector of size d
                 global vector<vector<int>> timestamp; // same dimensions, stores the last test case index that updated this residue
                 int current_test_case_index = 0;

             For each test case:
                 current_test_case_index++;
                 Then when updating residue r in modulus d for state i:
                     if (timestamp[d][r] != current_test_case_index) {
                         max1_value[d][r] = NEG_INF;
                         min0_value[d][r] = INF;
                         timestamp[d][r] = current_test_case_index;
                     }
                     then update.

          But the memory: we need to store for each residue: the value and the timestamp. The total residues is about 151525. The memory is fixed per modulus, so total memory for small moduli: 151525 * (sizeof(long long)*2 + sizeof(int))? Actually, we have two arrays: max1_value and min0_value, and one timestamp array. Then total memory: 151525 * (8*2+4) = 151525 * 20 = 3,030,500 bytes per test case? Actually, no: we store globally one set of arrays. Then we need 151525 * (8+8+4) = 20 * 151525 = 3,030,500 bytes = about 3 MB -> acceptable.

          And we only create one set of arrays globally.

          Steps:

             Precompute S = 550.

             Global:
                 max1_value = vector of vectors: for d in [1, S]: vector of d elements, initialized to NEG_INF.
                 min0_value = similarly, for d in [1, S]: vector of d elements, initialized to INF.
                 timestamp = for d in [1, S]: vector of d integers, initialized to 0.

             Then for each test case (indexed from 1 to C):
                 current_test_case_index = test_case_id (we can use a global counter that increments)

                 Then we process the test case: states from n down to 1.

                 For a state i:
                    d = p[i-1]

                    If d <= S:
                         residue = i % d
                         // Check and reset the residue if not updated in this test case?
                         if (timestamp[d][residue] != current_test_case_index) {
                             max1_value[d][residue] = NEG_INF;
                             min0_value[d][residue] = INF;
                             timestamp[d][residue] = current_test_case_index;
                         }
                         candidate0 = max1_value[d][residue]   // if there is any state j>i in the same residue, we have updated this to the best dp1[j] for j>i and same residue.
                         candidate1 = min0_value[d][residue]

                         Then compute dp0[i] and dp1[i] as above.

                    Else: iterate over multiples.

                    Then, update for every modulus d' in [1, S]:
                         residue = i % d'
                         if (timestamp[d'][residue] != current_test_case_index) {
                             max1_value[d'][residue] = NEG_INF;
                             min0_value[d'][residue] = INF;
                             timestamp[d'][residue] = current_test_case_index;
                         }
                         max1_value[d'][residue] = max(max1_value[d'][residue], dp1[i])
                         min0_value[d'][residue] = min(min0_value[d'][residue], dp0[i])

          However, note: when we update for modulus d', we might reset the entire residue class for d' and residue? But we are about to update it with the current state i. But we want to keep the best value from the states j>=i. And we process from n down to 1. So when we update, we are adding state i to the residue class. But we have already processed states j>i and updated the residue class. 

          Actually, the above update for residue class d' and residue r = i % d' is done for every state i. But we reset the residue class when we first access it in the test case? Then the state i is the first state in the test case that we update in this residue class? That would be wrong: because states j>i might have updated it already? 

          How do we handle the residue class update? 

          We want for a residue class (d', r) to store the best value (max of dp1, min of dp0) for states j in the residue class that have been processed (i.e., j>=i).

          We are processing i from n down to 1. When we start the test case, the arrays are not set. Then we reset a residue class the first time we access it (either in a query or an update). 

          But when we update, we do:

             if the residue class (d', r) has not been touched in this test case, we reset it to NEG_INF for max1 and INF for min0.

          Then we update it with the current state i: 
             max1_value[d'][r] = max( current_value, dp1[i] )
             min0_value[d'][r] = min( current_value, dp0[i] )

          But note: we want to store the best among states j>=i that have been processed. Since we process from high index to low, we update with the current state i and then later with a lower state? Actually, no: we update when we process the state. And when we process a state i, we update the residue class for every modulus d'? 

          How about a state j>i might have already updated the residue class? Then when we update the residue class for state i, we want to combine with the previous value from j>i. But if we reset the residue class when we first access it, then the first state j (the highest index) that falls into this residue class will reset it and then set it. Then the next state i (with i<j) that falls into the same residue class will access it and find the timestamp is current_test_case_index, so it doesn't reset, and then it updates by taking the best of the current state and the stored state (which is the best from j>i). That is what we want.

          But note: we have two kinds of accesses: 
             (1) when we are at a state i and we want to query for a modulus d (if d<=S) -> then we might access a residue class that has not been accessed in this test case -> we reset it. But then we have not updated it with any state j>i? So we get NEG_INF -> which means no state j>i in that residue class? That is correct.

             (2) when we update, we access the residue class: we reset if necessary and then update.

          However, the update for a residue class might be done by a state j>i already? Then when we get to state i, we don't reset (because the residue class has been accessed by j) and then we update with state i -> then the residue class holds the best value over states from j and i.

          Therefore, the procedure:

             Let S = 550.

             Preallocate globally:
                 max1_value: a 2D vector for d=1..S, with max1_value[d] being a vector of d elements (each initialized to NEG_INF).
                 min0_value: similarly, a 2D vector for d=1..S, each vector of d elements (initialized to INF).
                 timestamp: a 2D vector for d=1..S, each vector of d integers (initialized to 0).

             Let test_case_id = 0.

             For each test case:
                 test_case_id++

                 Read n, p, a.

                 Create dp0 and dp1 arrays of length n+1 (indexed 1..n).

                 For i from n down to 1:

                    d = p[i-1]
                    a_i = a[i-1]

                    // Step 1: Compute candidate for the current state i (if there are moves)
                    candidate0 = NEG_INF; // for maximizer: best dp1[j] for j in moves
                    candidate1 = INF;      // for minimizer: best dp0[j] for j in moves

                    if d <= S:
                         r = i % d;
                         // Check the residue class (d, r) for max1_value and min0_value: but note: we are going to use it for query? 
                         if (timestamp[d][r] == test_case_id) {
                             // already updated -> then the value stored is the best from states j>i in the same residue class? 
                             candidate0 = max1_value[d][r];
                             candidate1 = min0_value[d][r];
                         }
                         else {
                             // not updated in this test case -> then no state j>i in residue class (d, r) has been processed? 
                             candidate0 = NEG_INF;
                             candidate1 = INF;
                         }
                    else:
                         // large step: iterate over multiples
                         long long temp0 = NEG_INF;
                         long long temp1 = INF;

                         // else, candidate0 and candidate1 remain as NEG_INF and INF -> meaning no moves.

                    // Step 2: Compute dp0[i] and dp1[i]
                    if (candidate0 == NEG_INF) { // no valid move
                         dp0[i] = a_i;
                         dp1[i] = a_i;
                    }
                    else {
                         dp0[i] = max(a_i, a_i + candidate0);
                         dp1[i] = min(a_i, a_i + candidate1);
                    }

                    // Step 3: Update the residue classes for every modulus d' in [1, S]
                    for (int d_prime = 1; d_prime <= S; d_prime++) {
                         r = i % d_prime;
                         if (timestamp[d_prime][r] != test_case_id) {
                             // reset this residue class for the current test case
                             timestamp[d_prime][r] = test_case_id;
                             max1_value[d_prime][r] = NEG_INF;
                             min0_value[d_prime][r] = INF;
                         }
                         // update with the current state i
                         if (dp1[i] > max1_value[d_prime][r]) {
                             max1_value[d_prime][r] = dp1[i];
                         }
                         if (dp0[i] < min0_value[d_prime][r]) {
                             min0_value[d_prime][r] = dp0[i];
                         }
                    }

                 // End for i

                 Then output dp0[1..n]

          However, note: when we update the residue classes, we are updating for every modulus d' (from 1 to S). That is 550 updates per state. Then the total cost per test case is 550 * n, and the total over test cases is 550 * (sum of n) = 550 * 300000 = 165e6, which is acceptable.

          But note: the large step part: the total cost for large steps is the sum over states i with d> S of (number of multiples) = sum_{d=S+1}^{n} (n/d) per test case? Actually, we are doing one test case at a time, and the total n over test cases is 300000. And the harmonic sum: for each state i with d> S, the cost is O(n/d). And the total number of states with d> S is the number of distinct d in the permutation that are > S, which is n - S. But note: the permutation is over the entire range, so there are n - S such states. Then the total cost for large steps per test case is the harmonic sum: sum_{d=S+1}^{n} (n/d) = n * (H_n - H_S). For n=300000, that is about 300000 * (12.6 - 6.3) = 1.89e6 per test case. But the total over test cases: the sum of n over test cases is 300000, so the worst-case is one test case with n=300000 -> then the large steps cost 1.89e6, which is acceptable.

          However, the total cost for the entire program:

             Small step: 550 * (sum of n) = 550 * 300000 = 165e6.
             Large step: for each test case, we do the harmonic sum for the large steps. The total over test cases: the harmonic sum is done per test case? Actually, the harmonic sum in one test case of size n is about n * (H_n - H_S). But the total n over test cases is 300000, but if we have multiple test cases, we do the harmonic sum for each test case separately.

          Example: worst-case: one test case with n=300000: then large steps cost 1.89e6.

          But if we have many test cases? The total n over test cases is 300000, so the largest test case might be 300000, and the others are small. Then the total large steps cost:

             = sum_{test case} [ n * (H_{n} - H_S) ]   [for each state i with d>S: actually no, we do for each state i with d>S: the cost is n/d, but note: the state i is one per d? Actually, no: the state i has a step size d = p[i]. And p is a permutation, so each d appears exactly once per test case. Therefore, for a test case of size n, the cost for large steps is:

                 cost = 0;
                 for (d from S+1 to n) { 
                     if d appears in the permutation (it will) then we do: 
                         j = i0 + d, i0+2d, ... -> floor((n - i0)/d) iterations.
                 }

                 But the total cost is sum_{d=S+1}^{n} (number of multiples for the state with step size d) = sum_{d=S+1}^{n} floor((n - i0)/d) 

                 This is bounded by n * (H_n - H_S) (about 1.89e6 for n=300000).

          Then the total cost for large steps over all test cases is:

                 = sum_{test case} [ sum_{d=S+1}^{n} floor((n - i0)/d) ]

          But note: the total n over test cases is 300000, but the harmonic sum is per test case and the test cases are independent.

          How to bound the total large steps cost? 

                 total_large_cost = 0
                 for each test case (with size n_i):
                     total_large_cost += sum_{d=S+1}^{n_i} (n_i / d)   [approximately]

                 But note: the sum of n_i is 300000, but the harmonic sum for a test case of size n_i is about n_i * (ln(n_i) - ln(S)). 

                 Let T = 300000 (the total sum of n_i) and the maximum n_i is 300000. Then the worst-case total_large_cost might be the harmonic sum for the largest test case: 1.89e6, plus the harmonic sums for the smaller test cases.

          Actually, the total_large_cost is bounded by:

                 = sum_{test case} [ n_i * (H_{n_i} - H_S) ]

          And the sum of n_i is 300000, but the function f(n_i)=n_i * (H_{n_i}) is convex? 

          Worst-case: one test case with n_i=300000: then total_large_cost = 300000 * (H_{300000} - H_550) ≈ 300000 * (12.6-6.3) = 1.89e6.

          Then if we have two test cases: one with n1 and one with n2, the cost is about n1 * ln(n1) + n2 * ln(n2). The maximum when one is large? 

          Since the sum of n_i is 300000, the worst-case for the sum of n_i * ln(n_i) is when one n_i is 300000 and the others are 0? But the smallest n_i is 1. Actually, the worst-case is one test case with n_i=300000.

          Therefore, the total large steps cost is bounded by 1.89e6 per the largest test case, and the entire program's large steps cost is the sum over test cases, which is at most about 300000 * (H_{300000})? Actually, no: because the harmonic sum for a test case of size n_i is about n_i * (H_{n_i} - H_S). And the sum of n_i is 300000, but the harmonic part (H_{n_i}) is logarithmic. The worst-case total large steps cost is the harmonic sum for the largest test case, which is about 1.89e6, and the rest test cases (if any) are small. 

          Actually, the constraint: the sum of n_i is 300000. Then the total large steps cost:

                 total_large_cost <= sum_{each test case} [ n_i * (ln(n_i) + 1) ]   (since H_n <= ln(n)+1)

          And the maximum of this sum given that the sum of n_i is 300000 is achieved when one test case has n_i=300000: then cost = 300000*(ln(300000)+1) ≈ 300000 * (12.6+1) = 4.08e6, which is acceptable.

          Therefore, we implement as described.

          Let's code accordingly.

          Note: We assume that the arrays for small moduli (max1_value, min0_value, timestamp) are global and of fixed size (for d in [1..S]). We preallocate:

             const int S = 550;
             vector<vector<ll>> max1_value(S+1);   // max1_value[d] for d in [1, S] -> then we allocate each to vector of d elements? Actually, we can preallocate for d=1 to S: 
             vector<vector<ll>> min0_value(S+1);
             vector<vector<int>> timestamp(S+1);

          Then we initialize:

             for (int d = 1; d <= S; d++) {
                 max1_value[d] = vector<ll>(d, NEG_INF);
                 min0_value[d] = vector<ll>(d, POS_INF);
                 timestamp[d] = vector<int>(d, 0);
             }

          But note: we are going to use a global test_case_id (starting from 1) and we reset by the lazy method.

          However, we do not need to preinitialize the arrays to NEG_INF and POS_INF at the beginning of the program? Because we reset per residue when we first use it in a test case. So we can initialize the arrays to arbitrary values? Actually, we want the timestamp to be 0 initially so that the first test case will reset. Then we can initialize:

             for (int d=1; d<=S; d++) {
                 max1_value[d].resize(d, NEG_INF);
                 min0_value[d].resize(d, POS_INF);
                 timestamp[d].resize(d, 0);
             }

          Then we run the test cases.

          Important: we must use long long for the dp arrays and the arrays for small moduli? Because a_i can be up to 1e9 and n up to 300000, so the score can be as large as 300000*1e9 = 3e14, which fits in long long (which is 64-bit).

          Let's code accordingly.

          One more note: for the state i, when we update the residue classes for every modulus d' from 1 to S, we do:

             for (int d_prime = 1; d_prime <= S; d_prime++) {
                 int r = i % d_prime;
                 if (timestamp[d_prime][r] != test_case_id) {
                     timestamp[d_prime][r] = test_case_id;
                     max1_value[d_prime][r] = NEG_INF;
                     min0_value[d_prime][r] = POS_INF;
                 }
                 if (dp1[i] > max1_value[d_prime][r]) {
                     max1_value[d_prime][r] = dp1[i];
                 }
                 if (dp0[i] < min0_value[d_prime][r]) {
                     min0_value[d_prime][r] = dp0[i];
                 }
             }

          But note: we are updating the residue class for modulus d_prime and residue r with state i. This state i is the current state (which is being processed) and then we will use these arrays for states j < i.

          Since we process from high index to low, the arrays will eventually hold the best values for states j>=i.

          We are done.

          Let's run the sample:

            Input: 
                2
                10
                3 1 5 2 4 9 6 10 8 7
                1 -2 3 -4 5 -6 7 -8 9 -10
                4
                4 3 2 1
                3 2 3 3

          For the first test case: n=10, and the sample output: "8 7 3 -4 14 -6 7 -8 9 -10"

          How to check state 1: 
             p0 = 3 -> d=3 (<=550 -> small step)
             residue = 1 % 3 = 1.

             We haven't updated any state in residue class (3,1) -> then candidate0 = NEG_INF -> so we set dp0[1]=1? But the expected first integer is 8.

          Why 8? 

          Actually, the state 1: the player (maximizer) can choose k=3: then move to cell 4? Then the score becomes a1 + (minimizer's result from state 4). Then we need to know state 4.

          How do we compute state 4?
             We process from n down to 1.

          Therefore, we process i=10 first, then 9, 8, ... down to 1.

          So when we process state 1, we have already processed states 4,5,...,10.

          So the residue class (3,1) might have been updated by state 4? 

          State 4: p3 = 2 -> d=2 (<=S). 
             residue = 4 % 2 = 0.

          Then we update residue class for modulus 2: residue0 -> we set to the value of state4? But state4: 
             d=2 -> then moves: multiples of 2: 4+2=6, 4+4=8, 4+6=10, 4+8=12 (stop). Then states 6,8,10.

          How to compute state4: 
             We need to know states 6,8,10.

          Let's compute state10 first:
             d10 = p9 = 7 -> large step? (since 7>550? no, S=550, so 7<=550 -> small step? Actually, no: we do small step for d<=550, so 7<=550 -> small step).
             residue = 10 % 7 = 3.
             Then we look at residue class (7,3): not updated? -> no candidate -> then dp0[10]=a10=-10, dp1[10]=-10.

          Then update for d' from 1 to 550: 
             for d'=1: residue = 10 % 1 = 0 -> update modulus1 residue0: set to max1_value[1][0]=max(-10, current) -> but current is NEG_INF? so becomes -10? Similarly min0 becomes -10.

          Then state9:
             d9 = p8 = 8 -> small step? 8<=550 -> yes.
             residue = 9 % 8 = 1.
             Then candidate? residue class (8,1): not updated -> no candidate -> then dp0[9]=a9=9, dp1[9]=9.

             Then update: for d' from 1 to 550: update residue 9 mod d' for each d'.

          Then state8:
             d8 = p7 = 10 -> large step? 10<=550 -> small step? Actually, 10<=550 -> small step.
             residue = 8 % 10 = 8.
             candidate? not updated -> no candidate -> dp0[8]=a8=-8, dp1[8]=-8.

          Then state7:
             d7 = p6 = 6 -> small step.
             residue = 7 % 6 = 1.
             candidate? residue class (6,1): not updated -> no candidate -> dp0[7]=7, dp1[7]=7.

          Then state6:
             d6 = p5 = 9 -> small step.
             residue = 6 % 9 = 6.
             candidate? no -> dp0[6]=a6=-6, dp1[6]=-6.

          Then state5:
             d5 = p4 = 4 -> small step.
             residue = 5 % 4 = 1.
             candidate? residue class (4,1): not updated? 
                 But we have updated state9: 9 mod4 = 1? -> yes, we updated state9: for d'=4: residue=9%4=1 -> so when updating state9, we updated modulus4 residue1 to 9 (for max1) and 9 (for min0). Then state5: residue1 in modulus4 is updated? 
                 Actually, when we process state5, we check: 
                    d5=4, residue=1 -> then if timestamp[4][1]==test_case_id? yes (because state9 updated it). Then candidate0 = max1_value[4][1] = 9? candidate1 = min0_value[4][1] = 9? 
                 Then:
                    dp0[5] = max(5, 5+9) = max(5,14)=14
                    dp1[5] = min(5,5+9)=5.

          Then state4:
             d4 = p3 = 2 -> small step.
             residue = 4 % 2 = 0.
             candidate? residue class (2,0): 
                 states updated: state6: 6 mod2=0 -> state6: dp1[6]=-6; state8: 8 mod2=0 -> dp1[8]=-8; state10: 10 mod2=0 -> dp1[10]=-10.
                 Then the best candidate0 (maximizer) for state4 is the max of dp1[j] for j in moves? Actually, when we update residue class (2,0) for state4, we have already updated by state6,8,10? 
                 But note: we process state4 after states 5,6,7,8,9,10 -> so when we update residue class for modulus2 residue0, we have already updated by states 6,8,10? 
                 How did we update? 
                    state10: update modulus2: residue=10%2=0 -> then max1_value[2][0] = max(-10, -10) -> remains -10? but then state8: update modulus2 residue0: max1_value[2][0] = max(-10, -8) -> -8? then state6: update modulus2 residue0: max(-8, -6) -> -6? 
                 Then at state4: candidate0 = max1_value[2][0] = -6? 
                 candidate1 = min0_value[2][0] = min( ... ) = -10? 

                 Then for state4 (minimizer's turn? Actually, no: the state4 is the minimizer's turn? How do we know? 

          Actually, we have two arrays: 
             dp0[i] for when the first move at state i is the maximizer.
             dp1[i] for when the first move at state i is the minimizer.

          But note: the starting state is always the maximizer. However, in the recurrence, the state4 will be used as the next state from state1, which is the minimizer's turn? 

          How we compute state4: 
             The state4: when we are at state4, the current player is the minimizer? Actually, no: the turn depends on the move count. The state1: maximizer moves to state4 -> then state4 becomes minimizer's turn.

          Therefore, at state4, we are in a minimizer state? So we use dp1[4] = min( a4, a4 + min_{moves} dp0[j] ) 
          But note: the moves from state4: the minimizer can choose to end (score=a4=-4) or move to j in {6,8,10}. Then we need the minimizer to choose the move that minimizes the total score.

          The minimizer at state4: 
             Option1: end -> score = -4.
             Option2: move to 6: then score = a4 + dp0[6] = -4 + (-6) = -10.
             Option3: move to 8: then score = -4 + (-8) = -12.
             Option4: move to 10: then score = -4 + (-10) = -14.

          Then the minimizer will choose the minimum of these: -14? But the problem sample output for state4 is -4? Actually, the sample output: the 4th integer is -4.

          Why? Because the minimizer can choose to end immediately? Then the minimizer chooses to end and get -4.

          Therefore, dp1[4] = min(-4, -10, -12, -14) = -14? Actually, no: the minimizer can choose any move. The rules: the minimizer can choose a multiple k (any positive multiple) of p4=2. The minimizer can choose k=1000 to end immediately? Then that yields a4 = -4. Or they can choose k=2 to go to 6, k=4 to go to 8, k=6 to go to 10? 

          But note: the minimizer can choose to end the game by picking a k that is too large. So the options are: 
             end: score = -4
             move to 6: then the game continues: from state6, it is the maximizer's turn? Actually, no: after the minimizer moves to state6, the next turn is the maximizer? But the problem: the moves alternate. So after the minimizer moves to state6, the next player (the maximizer) will play at state6.

          Therefore, the minimizer at state4 must consider the entire continuation: 
             If they move to state6, then the maximizer will then play at state6 and the entire game will yield a score of a4 + (the result from state6, which is dp0[6] = -6). 

          But note: at state6, it is the maximizer's turn? So the minimizer at state4: 
             Option: end -> score = -4.
             Option: move to state6 -> score = a4 + (result from state6) = -4 + (-6) = -10.

          Then the minimizer will choose the minimum of -4 and -10 -> which is -10? 

          But the sample output for state4 is -4? Actually, the sample output: 
             "8 7 3 -4 14 -6 7 -8 9 -10"

          The fourth integer is -4, meaning when starting at state4, the final score is -4.

          Why? Because the minimizer at state4 has the option to end immediately? Then they choose that and get -4.

          Therefore, in our recurrence:

             dp1[4] = min( a4, a4 + min_{j in moves} dp0[j] )   [where moves are the states j that can be reached: 6,8,10]

          Then we compute:

             min_{j in moves} dp0[j] = min( dp0[6], dp0[8], dp0[10] ) = min(-6, -8, -10) = -10.

             Then dp1[4] = min(-4, -4 + (-10)) = min(-4, -14) = -14.

          That does not match the sample.

          The problem: the recurrence for the minimizer state is:

             dp1[i] = min( a_i, min_{j in moves} (a_i + dp0[j]) )

          But note: when the minimizer moves to j, then the next state j is a maximizer state? Yes. So the entire score from state j is dp0[j]. Then the total score for the game starting at state i is a_i + (the score from the rest of the moves).

          However, the sample output says -4 for starting at state4.

          How can that be? The problem says: the minimizer aims to minimize the score. Then why would the minimizer choose to move to state6 and get -10 when they can get -4 by ending? 

          Actually, the minimizer can choose to end the game by picking a k that is too large. Then the game ends immediately and the score is a_i. So the minimizer has two choices: either end and get a_i, or move and then the game continues and the total score becomes a_i + (the result from the next state). 

          Then the minimizer will choose the minimum between a_i and the minimum over the moves of (a_i + dp0[j]).

          Therefore, at state4: 
             Option1: end -> score = -4.
             Option2: move to 6: score = -4 + (-6) = -10 -> which is lower? Then the minimizer would choose that? 

          But the sample output says -4 for state4.

          This indicates that the sample output for starting at state4 is -4, meaning that the minimizer did not choose to move to 6? Why?

          Let me reexamine the problem statement:

             "SoCCat aims to minimize the score of the game, while you aim to maximize the score of the game."

          And the moves: the minimizer moves from state4. The minimizer can choose any multiple k of p4=2. They can choose k=2,4,6,... 

          The problem: the sample input also has:

             4
             4 3 2 1
             3 2 3 3

          and the output: "3 2 3 3"

          For the first test case, the fourth integer is -4.

          How do we get -4? 

          The minimizer at state4 has the option to end immediately? Then the score is -4. Alternatively, if they move to state6, the score becomes -4 + (the result from state6). The result from state6: the maximizer plays at state6? 

          How do we compute state6? 
             We did: state6: dp0[6]=-6 -> meaning when the game starts at state6 and it's the maximizer's turn, the final score is -6.

          Why is state6's result -6? 
             The maximizer at state6: 
                 They can end immediately: score = -6.
                 Or they can move: multiples of p5=9: then k=9,18,... -> then j=6+9=15>10 -> so no valid move? 
                 So the maximizer has no move? Then the game ends with score -6.

          Then the minimizer at state4: 
             Option1: end -> score=-4.
             Option2: move to state6 -> then the game continues: the maximizer at state6 will then end immediately? So the total score = a4 + a6 = -4 + (-6) = -10.

          Then the minimizer will choose the move that gives the minimum score: -10.

          But the sample output for state4 is -4.

          This is a contradiction.

          I see: the problem says: the score is initially 0. Then:

             When the token is at state4: the score is increased by a4 = -4.

             Then the minimizer chooses a move: if they choose to move to state6, then the token moves to state6 and the score becomes -4 (so far). Then it becomes the maximizer's turn at state6.

             Then the maximizer at state6: 
                 adds a6 = -6 -> then the score becomes -4 + (-6) = -10.
                 Then the maximizer must choose a multiple of p6=9: and the only multiples are 9,18,... -> then 6+9>10 -> the game ends.

             So the total score is -10.

          Then the minimizer at state4 can get -4 by ending or -10 by moving to state6. They choose -10? 

          But the sample output for starting at state4 is -4.

          This implies that the minimizer is not forced to move to state6? They can choose to end and get -4. Why would they choose to move and get -10? 

          Actually, the minimizer's goal is to minimize the score. They would choose the move that leads to the minimum score. Between -4 and -10, the minimum is -10. So they would choose to move to state6.

          Then the final score would be -10.

          But the sample output says -4.

          I see: the problem says: the starting player is the maximizer. Then the starting state s is the maximizer's turn.

          However, when we start at state4, the starting player at state4 is the minimizer? 

          Actually, the problem: 
             "For each s from 1 to n, ... if SoCCat initially places the token on the s-th cell"

          And the moves: 
             You (maximizer) move first, then SoCCat (minimizer) moves, then you, then SoCCat, etc.

          But if we start at state4, then the first move is by the maximizer? 

          The problem: 
             "SoCCat will place the token on the s-th cell. Additionally, both of you will keep track of the score of the game, which is initially 0. ... You will then take turns moving the token. You will move the token first"

          So the first move is always by the maximizer.

          Therefore, when starting at state4, the first move is by the maximizer? 

          Then we should use dp0[4] for the starting state4.

          How do we compute dp0[4]? 
             The maximizer at state4: 
                 adds a4 = -4.
                 Then they choose a multiple of p4=2: k=2,4,6,...
                 Options:
                    k=2: move to state6 -> then the score becomes -4 + (the result from state6, which is now the minimizer's turn? Actually, after the maximizer moves to state6, the next turn is the minimizer? But note: the problem: the state6 will be played by the minimizer? 

          However, we defined:
             dp0[i]: the optimal score when starting at cell i and it is the maximizer's turn.
             dp1[i]: the optimal score when starting at cell i and it is the minimizer's turn.

          Then when the maximizer moves from state4 to state6, the next state is state6 with the minimizer's turn? So the total score is -4 + dp1[6].

          How do we compute dp1[6]? 
             The minimizer at state6: 
                 adds a6 = -6.
                 Then they choose a multiple of p6=9: no valid move? Then the game ends -> score = -6.
                 So dp1[6] = -6.

          Then the option for the maximizer: moving to state6 yields: -4 + (-6) = -10.

          The maximizer can also choose to end immediately: then score = -4.

          Then the maximizer will choose the maximum between: 
             -4 (ending) and -10 (moving to state6) -> so they choose -4.

          Therefore, dp0[4] = max(-4, -10) = -4.

          So the recurrence for state4 (as a maximizer state) is -4.

          Therefore, we have:

             dp0[i] = for the maximizer: max( a_i, a_i + max_{j in moves} dp1[j] )
             dp1[i] = for the minimizer: min( a_i, a_i + min_{j in moves} dp0[j] )

          And the state4 is a maximizer state? Only when it is the starting state? But note: in the recurrence, we must know the turn.

          Actually, the turn alternates. Therefore, when we are at state4 and it is the maximizer's turn, we use dp0[4]. But if it is the minimizer's turn, we use dp1[4].

          How we use the recurrence:

             For state6: 
                 It is the minimizer's turn? 
                    dp1[6] = min( a6, a6 + min_{moves} dp0[j] ) 
                 But there are no moves? Then the min_{moves} part is not defined? Then we set to a6.

                 So dp1[6] = min(-6, ...) -> but if there are no moves, we only have the option to end: then dp1[6] = -6.

             For state4 (as a maximizer's state: dp0[4]):
                 moves: j=6,8,10 -> then we need dp1[6], dp1[8], dp1[10]?
                 But note: the next state after a maximizer's move is a minimizer's turn? So we use dp1[j] for the next state.

          Therefore, we must compute:

             dp0[4] = max( a4, a4 + max{ dp1[6], dp1[8], dp1[10] } ) 
                      = max(-4, -4 + max{ -6, -8, -10 } ) 
                      = max(-4, -4 + (-6)) 
                      = max(-4, -10) = -4.

          Then the sample output for state4 is -4.

          So the recurrence: 
             For state i:
                 if it is the maximizer's turn: 
                    candidate = max_{j in moves} dp1[j]   (if there is at least one move)
                    dp0[i] = max( a_i, a_i + candidate )
                 if it is the minimizer's turn:
                    candidate = min_{j in moves} dp0[j]   (if there is at least one move)
                    dp1[i] = min( a_i, a_i + candidate )

          But note: the state i can be either turn? 

          How do we know the turn for the recurrence? 

          We are storing two arrays: dp0 and dp1.

          For a state i, we are processing it independently of the turn? Actually, we are storing by turn.

          Then in the recurrence for a state i, we do not know the turn? We store both dp0 and dp1 for state i.

          But when we move from state i to state j, we know that the next state j will be of the opposite turn. 

          Therefore, when we are at state i and it is the maximizer's turn, we look at dp1[j] for the next state j.

          And when we are at state i and it is the minimizer's turn, we look at dp0[j] for the next state j.

          Therefore, we must modify the candidate gathering:

             For a state i (whether it is dp0 or dp1) we only care about the next state's value of the opposite turn.

          But in the recurrence for dp0[i] (maximizer's turn at i) we need the next state's dp1[j] (minimizer's turn at j).

          And for dp1[i] (minimizer's turn at i) we need the next state's dp0[j] (maximizer's turn at j).

          Therefore, in our algorithm:

             For state i:

                 // For the current state i, we will compute both dp0[i] and dp1[i]? 
                 // Actually, we compute one of them? 

          But note: we store both arrays. And we compute for state i:

                 d = p[i-1]
                 moves: j = i + k (multiples of d) and j<=n.

                 Then:

                    // For dp0[i]: we are at a maximizer state i.
                    candidate0 = NEG_INF
                    for each j in moves:
                         candidate0 = max(candidate0, dp1[j])

                    Then dp0[i] = max( a_i, a_i + candidate0 )   [if there is at least one move; if none, then candidate0 is NEG_INF and we use a_i]

                    // For dp1[i]: we are at a minimizer state i.
                    candidate1 = POS_INF
                    for each j in moves:
                         candidate1 = min(candidate1, dp0[j])

                    Then dp1[i] = min( a_i, a_i + candidate1 )

          However, we are storing by state i both dp0 and dp1? 

          But note: the state i is either the starting state or arrived by a move. The turn of state i is fixed by the move count: if the starting state is s and the first move is the maximizer, then state s is maximizer. Then state j (reached by the first move) is minimizer.

          But in the recurrence, we do not know the turn of state i? 

          Actually, we are not given the turn as input? 

          How we are storing: we store two values per state: 
             dp0[i] = result if it is the maximizer's turn to play at state i.
             dp1[i] = result if it is the minimizer's turn to play at state i.

          Then when we compute a state i, we compute both.

          But the sample: state4: 
             We computed dp0[4] = -4 and dp1[4] = min( a4, a4 + min_{j} dp0[j] ) = min(-4, -4 + min(-6,-8,-10)) = min(-4, -4-10) = min(-4,-14) = -14.

          Then when starting at state4 (which is the maximizer's turn) we use dp0[4]=-4.

          But if we start at state4 and it is the minimizer's turn? then we would use dp1[4]=-14.

          However, the problem: the starting state is always the maximizer's turn.

          So we only output dp0[s] for s from 1 to n.

          Therefore, we only care about dp0[s] for the starting state s.

          But to compute dp0[i] for a state i, we might need dp1[j] for j>i, and to compute dp1[i] we need dp0[j] for j>i.

          We are processing from high to low, so we have j>i already computed.

          Therefore, we compute both dp0 and dp1 for every state i.

          Then the recurrence:

             for i from n downto 1:

                 // For the current state i, we need to compute:
                 //   dp0[i] = ... 
                 //   dp1[i] = ...

                 d = p[i-1]
                 a_i = a[i-1]

                 // For the moves: the set of j = i + k (multiple of d) and j<=n.

                 // For the maximizer state at i: we need the maximum dp1[j] for j in moves.
                 // For the minimizer state at i: we need the minimum dp0[j] for j in moves.

                 // How to gather these efficiently? by the sqrt method.

                 // We gather candidate0 = maximum dp1[j] for j in moves (if any) -> for dp0[i]
                 //          candidate1 = minimum dp0[j] for j in moves (if any) -> for dp1[i]

                 // Then:
                 if there was at least one j for candidate0? (candidate0 != NEG_INF) 
                     dp0[i] = max(a_i, a_i + candidate0)
                 else
                     dp0[i] = a_i

                 if there was at least one j for candidate1? (candidate1 != POS_INF)
                     dp1[i] = min(a_i, a_i + candidate1)
                 else
                     dp1[i] = a_i

                 // Then update the residue classes for every modulus d' in [1, S] for state i: 
                 //   for each d' in 1..S:
                 //        r = i % d'
                 //        update the residue class (d',r) for the values of dp0[i] and dp1[i] (for future states j<i)

          Now, with this recurrence, state4 (i=4) is a maximizer state? But we are computing both. 
             dp0[4] = max( a4, a4 + max_{j in moves} dp1[j] ) 
                     = max(-4, -4 + max{ dp1[6], dp1[8], dp1[10] } )
                     = max(-4, -4 + max{-6, -8, -10}) 
                     = max(-4, -4-6) = max(-4, -10) = -4.

             dp1[4] = min( a4, a4 + min_{j in moves} dp0[j] )
                     = min(-4, -4 + min{ dp0[6], dp0[8], dp0[10] } )
                     = min(-4, -4 + min{-6, -8, -10}) 
                     = min(-4, -4-10) = min(-4, -14) = -14.

          Then for starting state4 we output dp0[4] = -4.

          This matches the sample.

          Therefore, we modify the algorithm to compute both.

          But note: in the residue class update, we update with both dp0[i] and dp1[i]? 
             For modulus d', we update:
                 max1_value[d'][r] = max( max1_value[d'][r], dp1[i] )   // because for a future state j that is a maximizer state, it will look for the best dp1[k] (minimizer state) in the same residue class.
                 min0_value[d'][r] = min( min0_value[d'][r], dp0[i] )   // because for a future state j that is a minimizer state, it will look for the best dp0[k] (maximizer state) in the same residue class.

          Why? 
             Consider a future state j (with j<i) that is a maximizer state and has step size d (which is<=S) and residue r = j % d. 
                 Then we will use max1_value[d][r] to get the best dp1[k] for k in the residue class and k>=j (which includes i, because j<i and we process from high to low).

          But note: the future state j (maximizer) will want to find the best (max) of dp1[k] for k in the same residue class and k>j. And we have stored in max1_value[d][r] the maximum dp1[k] for k>=j? Actually, we update the residue class with state i when we process i (which is greater than j, but we process i before j). Then when we process j, we have already updated the residue class with state i (and any state between j and i). So the max1_value[d][r] holds the best over k>=j.

          Therefore, the update is correct.

          Let's code accordingly.

          We'll use:
            const int S = 550;
            typedef long long ll;
            const ll NEG_INF = -1e18;
            const ll POS_INF = 1e18;

          Global arrays:
            vector<vector<ll>> max1_val(S+1);   // for d in [1, S]: max1_val[d] is a vector of d elements, storing the best (max) dp1[i] in residue class r for the current test case.
            vector<vector<ll>> min0_val(S+1);   // for d in [1, S]: min0_val[d] is a vector of d elements, storing the best (min) dp0[i] in residue class r for the current test case.
            vector<vector<int>> timestamp(S+1); // for d in [1, S]: timestamp[d] is a vector of d integers, storing the last test case id that updated this residue.

          Then we iterate test cases.

          For each test case, we do:

            int n = ...;
            vector<int> p = ...;
            vector<ll> a = ...;

            vector<ll> dp0(n+1);   // 1-indexed: dp0[1]..dp0[n]
            vector<ll> dp1(n+1);   // 1-indexed

            for (int i = n; i>=1; i--) {
                int d = p[i-1];
                ll a_i = a[i-1];

                ll candidate0 = NEG_INF; // for dp0[i]: we need the max of dp1[j] for j in moves.
                ll candidate1 = POS_INF; // for dp1[i]: we need the min of dp0[j] for j in moves.

                if (d <= S) {
                    int r = i % d;
                    // Check if the residue class (d, r) has been updated in this test case: 
                    if (timestamp[d][r] == test_case_id) {
                        candidate0 = max1_val[d][r];
                        candidate1 = min0_val[d][r];
                    } 
                    // else: remains NEG_INF and POS_INF -> which means no j has been found.
                } else {
                    // d > S: iterate over multiples.
                    int j_index = i + d;
                    int count = 0;
                    while (j_index <= n) {
                        count++;
                        if (dp1[j_index] > candidate0) candidate0 = dp1[j_index];
                        if (dp0[j_index] < candidate1) candidate1 = dp0[j_index];
                        j_index += d;
                    }
                    // If no multiple found, candidate0 remains NEG_INF, candidate1 remains POS_INF.
                }

                // Compute dp0[i] and dp1[i]:
                if (candidate0 == NEG_INF) {
                    // no move for the maximizer: then the maximizer can only end.
                    dp0[i] = a_i;
                } else {
                    dp0[i] = max(a_i, a_i + candidate0);
                }

                if (candidate1 == POS_INF) {
                    dp1[i] = a_i;
                } else {
                    dp1[i] = min(a_i, a_i + candidate1);
                }

                // Update the residue classes for all d' in [1, S]
                for (int d_prime = 1; d_prime <= S; d_prime++) {
                    int r = i % d_prime;
                    if (timestamp[d_prime][r] != test_case_id) {
                        // reset this residue class for the current test case
                        timestamp[d_prime][r] = test_case_id;
                        max1_val[d_prime][r] = NEG_INF;
                        min0_val[d_prime][r] = POS_INF;
                    }
                    if (dp1[i] > max1_val[d_prime][r]) {
                        max1_val[d_prime][r] = dp1[i];
                    }
                    if (dp0[i] < min0_val[d_prime][r]) {
                        min0_val[d_prime][r] = dp0[i];
                    }
                }
            }

            // Then output: dp0[1] to dp0[n] for the starting positions.

          We'll run the sample test case 1: n=10.

          We hope that the output for state1 is 8.

          How to compute state1:
             i=1: d = p0=3 (small step)
                 residue = 1 % 3 = 1.
                 Check timestamp[3][1]: not set? (if test_case_id=1, and we haven't updated it) -> then candidate0 = NEG_INF -> so dp0[1] = a1 = 1? 
                 But expected is 8.

          Why? 

          The state1: the maximizer has moves: multiples of 3: 1+3=4, 1+6=7, 1+9=10.

          Then candidate0 = max{ dp1[4], dp1[7], dp1[10] } = max{ dp1[4], dp1[7], dp1[10] }

          We have computed:
             dp1[4] = -14, dp1[7]=? 

          Let's compute state7:
             i=7: d = p6=6 -> small step.
                 residue = 7 % 6 = 1.
                 Check residue class (6,1): we have updated it? 
                    We updated state10: for modulus6: residue=10%6=4 -> so not updated? 
                    state9: 9%6=3 -> not residue1.
                    state8: 8%6=2 -> not.
                    state7: we are at state7, so we haven't updated it yet? -> then candidate0 = NEG_INF -> then dp0[7] = a7=7, and then dp1[7]= min(7, ...) -> but wait, we compute both?

          Actually, at state7: 
             d=6 -> small step? 
                 residue=1 -> not updated -> candidate0 for dp0[7] = NEG_INF -> then dp0[7]=7? 
                 candidate1 for dp1[7] = POS_INF -> then dp1[7]=7? 

          Then state1: 
             candidate0 = max{ dp1[4], dp1[7], dp1[10] } = max{ -14, 7, -10 } = 7.

          Then dp0[1] = max( a1, a1 + candidate0 ) = max(1, 1+7)=max(1,8)=8.

          This matches.

          Therefore, we code accordingly.

          Note: the state10: 
             i=10: d = p9=7 -> small step? 
                 residue=10%7=3 -> not updated -> then candidate0 = NEG_INF -> then dp0[10]=a10=-10, and then candidate1 for dp1[10]=? (we don't need it for state1) but we compute: 
                    dp1[10] = min(-10, ...) = -10.

          Then state8: 
             i=8: d=p7=10 -> small step? 
                 residue=8%10=8 -> not updated -> dp0[8]=-8, dp1[8]=-8.

          Then state4: we already computed.

          Then state1: 8.

          The rest: 
             state2: d = p1=1 -> small step: residue=2%1=0? 
                 residue=0: we need to update. How many states j>2 with j mod1=0? all states? 
                 candidate0 = max1_val[1][0] -> which is the max of dp1[j] for j>=2? 
                    states: 
                      j=10: dp1[10]=-10
                      j=9: dp1[9]=? 
                         state9: d=p8=8 -> residue=9%8=1 -> then candidate0 = NEG_INF? -> then dp0[9]=9, dp1[9]=9.
                      j=8: dp1[8]=-8
                      j=7: dp1[7]=7
                      j=6: dp1[6]=-6
                      j=5: dp1[5]=? 
                         state5: d=p4=4 -> residue=5%4=1 -> then candidate0 = max1_val[4][1] = max( dp1[j] for j>=5 and j%4=1) -> state9: j=9: 9%4=1 -> dp1[9]=9 -> so candidate0=9 -> then dp0[5]=max(5,5+9)=14, dp1[5]=min(5,5+min0_val[4][1]) -> min0_val[4][1] = min( dp0[j] for j>=5 and j%4=1) = dp0[9]=9 -> then dp1[5]=min(5,5+9)=5.
                      Then j=5: dp1[5]=5? 
                    So the max of dp1[j] for j from 2 to 10: the maximum is 9? (from state9) 
                 Then dp0[2] = max( a2, a2+9 ) = max(-2, -2+9)=max(-2,7)=7.

          Then the output: 
             dp0[1]=8, dp0[2]=7, dp0[3]=? 

          Let's compute state3:
             i=3: d=p2=5 -> small step? 
                 residue=3%5=3 -> not updated? 
                 We have to update: we have states: 3+5=8, 3+10=13>10 -> only state8.
                 candidate0 = dp1[8] = -8.
                 Then dp0[3] = max( a3, a3 -8 ) = max(3, 3-8)=max(3,-5)=3.

          Then the output: 8,7,3,-4,14,-6,7,-8,9,-10 -> matches.

          Therefore, we code accordingly.

          Important: the total n over test cases is 300000, so we hope that the inner loop (over d_prime from 1 to S) is 550 per state -> total 550 * 300000 = 165e6, and the large steps total cost is about the harmonic sum for the largest test case (1.89e6) and the rest test cases are smaller. Then overall the program runs in about 165e6 + 1.89e6 = 166.89e6 operations per test case? Actually, no: the 165e6 is the total over test cases? 

          Actually, the 165e6 is 550 * (sum of n) = 550 * 300000 = 165e6.

          The large steps cost: for each test case, we do the harmonic sum for the large steps. The total cost for large steps over all test cases is bounded by the harmonic sums for the test cases. Since the sum of n is 300000, the worst-case large steps cost is about 4.08e6 (for one test case of size 300000) and the rest are small? Then the entire program is about 165e6 + 4.08e6 = 169.08e6, which is acceptable in C++.

          We'll code accordingly.

          Note: we assume that the modulus 0 for modulus1: 0 % 1 = 0? and we update it.

          Let's code.

          Steps:

             Preallocate the global arrays for d=1..S: 
                 max1_val, min0_val, timestamp: each as vector of vectors of size S+1, and then for d from 1 to S, we do:
                    max1_val[d].resize(d, NEG_INF);
                    min0_val[d].resize(d, POS_INF);
                    timestamp[d].resize(d, 0);

             Let test_case_id = 1.

             For each test case:
                 Read n, p (size n), a (size n).

                 Create dp0 and dp1 of size n+1 (indexed 1..n).

                 For i from n down to 1:

                    d = p[i-1], a_i = a[i-1]

                    // ... [as above]

                 Then output dp0[1] ... dp0[n]

          We must be cautious: the modulus by d when d=0? but d>=1.

          Let's run the second sample:

            n=4
            p = [4,3,2,1] -> p0=4, p1=3, p2=2, p3=1.
            a = [3,2,3,3]

            Process i=4: d = p3=1 (small step) -> residue=4%1=0.
               Check timestamp[1][0]: not updated? -> candidate0 = NEG_INF -> dp0[4]=3, candidate1=POS_INF -> dp1[4]=3.
               Then update for d' from 1 to S: 
                  for d_prime=1: residue=4%1=0 -> set timestamp[1][0] = test_case_id, then set to dp1[4]=3 (for max1_val) and dp0[4]=3 (for min0_val).

            i=3: d=p2=2 (small step) -> residue=3%2=1.
               Check timestamp[2][1]: not updated? -> candidate0 = NEG_INF -> dp0[3]=3, candidate1=POS_INF -> dp1[3]=3.
               Then update for d' from 1 to S: 
                  for d_prime=1: residue=3%1=0 -> update: 
                         max1_val[1][0] = max(3, 3)=3 -> remains 3? but we had 3 from state4 -> so it's still 3? 
                         min0_val[1][0] = min(3,3)=3.
                  for d_prime=2: residue=3%2=1 -> reset? then set to 3 for both.

            i=2: d=p1=3 (small step) -> residue=2%3=2.
               Check: not updated? -> candidate0 = NEG_INF -> dp0[2]=2, dp1[2]=2.
               Then update for d' from 1 to S: 
                  for d_prime=1: residue=0 -> update: max1_val[1][0]=max(3,2)=3; min0_val[1][0]=min(3,2)=2.
                  for d_prime=2: residue=0? 2%2=0 -> reset? 
                         timestamp[2][0] = test_case_id, then set to NEG_INF and POS_INF? then update: 
                             max1_val[2][0] = max(NEG_INF, 2)=2
                             min0_val[2][0] = min(POS_INF, 2)=2
                  for d_prime=3: residue=2%3=2 -> reset? then set to 2.

            i=1: d=p0=4 (small step) -> residue=1%4=1.
               Check: not updated? -> candidate0 = NEG_INF -> dp0[1]=3, dp1[1]=3.

            Then output: dp0[1]=3, dp0[2]=2, dp0[3]=3, dp0[4]=3.

          But the sample output: "3 2 3 3"

          So it matches.

          Therefore, we output: "3 2 3 3"

          We'll code accordingly.

          Note: the arrays for the small moduli are global and we use a lazy reset per residue per test case.

          Let's code in C++.

          Important: we must use long long for the values.

          Also, we must be cautious: the state i: we use i from 1 to n.

          We'll use 1-indexing for the dp arrays.

          The arrays p and a: 
             p[0] is the p for the first cell.

          We assume the input is 0-indexed.

          We'll read:

             int n;
             cin >> n;
             vector<int> p(n);
             vector<long long> a(n);
             for (int i=0; i<n; i++) cin >> p[i];
             for (int i=0; i<n; i++) cin >> a[i];

          Then in the loop for states: i from n down to 1:

             d = p[i-1]   // because the first cell is cell1 -> p0 is for cell1.

          However, the problem: the token is placed on the s-th cell from the left, which is the cell with p_s and a_s.

          The array p: the first integer is p_1.

          Therefore, our indexing:

             cell1: p[0], a[0]
             cell2: p[1], a[1]
             ...

          So when we are at cell i (the i-th cell), the value p_i is p[i-1], and a_i = a[i-1].

          We'll run.

          We hope it passes.

          Note: the worst-case memory: 
             The global arrays: 
                 For d=1..S: the total memory is about (1+2+...+S) * 3 * (sizeof(long long)+sizeof(int) for timestamp? 
                 Actually, for each residue: we store:
                    max1_val: long long
                    min0_val: long long
                    timestamp: int

                 The total residues: about S*(S+1)/2 = 550*551/2 = 151525.
                 Then the total memory: 151525 * (8+8+4) = 151525 * 20 = 3,030,500 bytes = about 3 MB.

          Then we have the test cases: we store the arrays p and a for the test case: the total n over test cases is 300000, so the total memory for storing the test cases is 300000*(4+8) = 3.6e6 * 12 = 43.2e6? Actually, we store one test case at a time -> so the memory for the current test case is about 12 * n.

          Then total memory: 3MB (global) + 12 * 300000 (for the largest test case) = 3.6e6 * 12 = 43.2e6? 43.2 MB, which is acceptable.

          We hope.

          Let's code accordingly.

          We'll use:

             #include <iostream>
             #include <vector>
             #include <cmath>
             #include <algorithm>

             vector<vector<long long>> min0_val(S+1);
             vector<vector<int>> timestamp_vec(S+1);   // because 'timestamp' might be a macro?

             int main() {

                     min0_val[d].resize(d, POS_INF);
                     timestamp_vec[d].resize(d, 0);

                     for (int i=0; i<n; i++) cin >> a[i];

                     vector<long long> dp0(n+1, 0);   // 1-indexed: index 0 unused
                     vector<long long> dp1(n+1, 0);

                                 }
                                 if (dp0[j] < candidate1) {
                                     candidate1 = dp0[j];
                                 }
                             }
                         }

                         // Compute dp0[i] and dp1[i]
                         if (candidate0 == NEG_INF) {
                             dp0[i] = a_i;
                         } else {
                             dp0[i] = max(a_i, a_i + candidate0);
                         }

                         if (candidate1 == POS_INF) {
                             dp1[i] = a_i;
                         } else {
                             dp1[i] = min(a_i, a_i + candidate1);
                         }

                         // Update the residue classes for every modulus d_prime from 1 to S
                         for (int d_prime = 1; d_prime <= S; d_prime++) {
                             int r = i % d_prime;
                             if (timestamp_vec[d_prime][r] != test_case_id) {
                                 // reset this residue class for the current test case
                                 timestamp_vec[d_prime][r] = test_case_id;
                                 max1_val[d_prime][r] = NEG_INF;
                                 min0_val[d_prime][r] = POS_INF;
                             }
                             // Update max1_val: with dp1[i]
                             if (dp1[i] > max1_val[d_prime][r]) {
                                 max1_val[d_prime][r] = dp1[i];
                             }
                             if (dp0[i] < min0_val[d_prime][r]) {
                                 min0_val[d_prime][r] = dp0[i];
                             }
                         }
                     }

                     // Output: for s=1 to n: dp0[s]
                     for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {
                         cout << dp0[i];
                         if (i < n) cout << " ";
                         else cout << "\n";
                     }
                 }
                 return 0;
             }

          But note: the problem output for the first test case: "8 7 3 -4 14 -6 7 -8 9 -10"

          However, the problem says: output a single line for each test case containing n integers.

          We output a newline at the end of each test case.

          Let me check: the first test case: n=10, we output 10 integers.

          But the second test case: n=4, we output 4 integers.

          We hope it runs within the constraints.

          However, note: the worst-case for the inner loop (over d_prime from 1 to S) is 550 per state, and the total states over test cases is 300000, so total operations 550 * 300000 = 165e6, which is acceptable in C++.

          The large steps: the worst-case test case of n=300000: the total cost for large steps: 
                 = sum_{d=S+1}^{n} (n_i / d)   [for the one state per d] 
                 ≈ 300000 * (H_{300000} - H_S) ≈ 1.89e6, which is acceptable.

          But note: the worst-case overall: 165e6 + (sum over test cases of the harmonic sum) <= 165e6 + 4.08e6 = 169.08e6, which is acceptable.

          We'll submit.

          However, note: the sample test cases are small. We should run the sample.

          We'll run the provided sample.

          Sample 1: 
             Input: 
                 2
                 10
                 3 1 5 2 4 9 6 10 8 7
                 1 -2 3 -4 5 -6 7 -8 9 -10
                 4
                 4 3 2 1
                 3 2 3 3

          Output for the first test case: "8 7 3 -4 14 -6 7 -8 9 -10"

          Output for the second: "3 2 3 3"

          We hope.

          Let me run by hand for state5: 
             i=5: d = p4=4 -> small step? 
                 residue = 5 % 4 = 1.
                 Check: we have updated state9? state9: i=9: d=p8=8 -> residue=9%8=1 -> then we updated modulus4 residue1? 
                    When we updated state9: 
                         for d_prime=4: residue=9%4=1 -> we set max1_val[4][1] = max( ... , dp1[9]=?) 
                    How do we compute state9?
                         i=9: d=8 -> small step? 
                         residue=9%8=1 -> not updated? -> candidate0 = NEG_INF -> dp0[9]=9, candidate1=POS_INF -> dp1[9]=9.
                         Then update: for d_prime=4: residue=9%4=1 -> reset? then set to 9 for max1_val and min0_val? 
                    Then at state5: 
                         candidate0 = max1_val[4][1] = 9 -> then dp0[5] = max(5, 5+9)=14.
                         candidate1 = min0_val[4][1] = 9 -> then dp1[5] = min(5,5+9)=5.

          So state5: output 14.

          This matches.

          We'll write the code accordingly.

          Note: we use a lot of memory for the global arrays: 3MB, which is acceptable.

          We run the code on the sample.

          But note: the modulus 0 for d=1: we do i%1 is always 0? Then we update residue0 for modulus1 for every state.

          We hope.

          Let me run the code for the first test case.

          Due to the complexity, we write the code and hope.

          We'll submit the code.
