 We are going to follow the editorial approach.
 Steps:
 1. The maximum damage T is the OR of all a_i: T = a1 | a2 | ... | an.
 2. Then we need to assign x_i for each member such that the XOR of all x_i is T and 0<=x_i<=a_i.
    How?
    We note that for each bit j that is set in T, we need an odd number of x_i's having the j-th bit set.
    Also, for each member i, we can set the j-th bit in x_i only if a_i has the j-th bit set (so that x_i<=a_i).

    So we traverse each bit j (from 0 to 60, since 10^18 < 2^60) that is set in T:
        - Collect all indices i for which a_i has the j-th bit set.
        - If the number of such indices is even, we remove one index (so that we have an odd count) to set the j-th bit.
        - Then for each index in the collected list (after ensuring odd count), set the j-th bit in x_i.

    However, note: we must not set a bit in x_i that would make x_i exceed a_i. But since we only set a bit j if a_i has that bit, it is safe.

 3. But there's a catch: what about the bits that are not set in T? We leave them as 0. Since the assignment for each x_i is built by ORing the bits we set, and we set only bits that are in T and that are allowed by a_i.

 However, note: the above construction might set multiple bits arbitrarily and we must ensure that the XOR of all x_i is exactly T.

 Why is the XOR equal to T?
    Consider each bit j:
        - If the bit j is set in T, then we set it in an odd number of x_i -> so the XOR for bit j is 1.
        - If the bit j is not set in T, then we never set it in any x_i -> so the XOR for bit j is 0.

 Therefore, the XOR is T.

 But note: we must also check that the constructed x_i does not exceed a_i. However, we set only bits that are present in a_i (so for each x_i, the bits we set are a subset of the bits in a_i). Since a_i has the bit j, then setting that bit (and possibly others that we set) will not exceed a_i? 

 Why? Actually, we are setting bits independently. However, note that a_i might not have all the bits that we set? Actually no: we set a bit j in x_i only if a_i has the bit j. But we set multiple bits? And the value of x_i might be the OR of several bits? It might exceed a_i?

 Example: 
    Suppose a_i = 5 (binary 101). 
    We might set the 0th bit and the 2nd bit -> then x_i becomes 5, which is <=5, okay.
    But what if we set the 0th and the 1st? Then we get 3, which is also <=5? 
    Actually, the problem is: we are setting bits independently without considering that the number we form must be <= a_i. However, note:

    The key is: we are only setting bits that are present in a_i? But that alone does not guarantee that x_i<=a_i. Consider:

        a_i = 5 (binary 101), and we set the 2nd bit and the 0th bit -> 5, which is okay.

        But what if we set the 2nd bit and the 1st bit? Then we get 6, which is >5 -> invalid.

    How to avoid this? Note: we are setting bits in increasing order? Actually, we are iterating from j=0 to 60? And we set each bit independently? 

    The issue: we must assign x_i without exceeding a_i. How can we guarantee that?

    Alternate approach: we can set the bits in descending order (from high to low) and then use a greedy method? 

    Actually, note: the value we assign to x_i is the OR of the bits we set. But we set bits that are in a_i. However, if we set a bit that is the highest bit of a_i, then we are safe for that bit? But the problem is the combination of bits.

    How about: we set the bits arbitrarily and then we must have x_i <= a_i? Actually, no. We must be cautious.

    Insight: Instead of building x_i by setting bits independently, we can use the following:

        We know that T is the OR of all a_i. We want to assign x_i such that x_i <= a_i and the XOR of the x_i is T.

        There is a known construction: 
          Let x_1 = a_1, then for i from 2 to n, set x_i = ...? 

        Alternatively, we can do:

          We set x_1 = T, but we must have x_1 <= a_1? Not necessarily.

    Another idea: we can use the following construction:

        Let R = T. We want to assign each x_i such that the XOR is T.

        We can set:
          x_1 = a_1
          x_2 = ... 

        Actually, we can do:

          x_1 = a_1
          x_2 = a_2
          ... until the last one.

        But then the XOR might not be T.

    Instead, note: the problem does not require the assignment to be unique. We can use a greedy bit-by-bit assignment that ensures:

        For each bit j (from high to low or low to high?):

          We need to assign the j-th bit to an odd number of x_i that are allowed to have the j-th bit.

        And we must not exceed a_i. How? 

        Actually, we can use the following: since we are setting only the bits that are in T and we set them independently, we can form x_i as the OR of the bits j (for which we selected this i) that are in T and in a_i.

        But note: the value of x_i is the OR of the bits we set. However, if we set two bits j and k, then the value is (1<<j) | (1<<k). And we require that (1<<j) | (1<<k) <= a_i.

        But if a_i has both bits set, then it does not necessarily mean that the OR of any subset of bits is <= a_i? 

        Example: a_i = 5 (101). If we set the 2nd bit and the 1st bit, we get 110 (binary) = 6, which is >5.

        So we must avoid setting a bit that would cause x_i to exceed a_i. How?

        We can set the bits in descending order (from the highest to the lowest) and then:

          For a fixed i, we are going to set the bits in descending order? Then when we set a bit j, we check: if the current value of x_i plus (1<<j) is <= a_i? But note: we are setting bits independently and we haven't set all bits? 

        Alternatively, we can set the bits arbitrarily and then if the value of x_i we built is greater than a_i, we adjust? But that seems messy.

    Revised approach: we use the idea that we set each bit j only in the x_i that we choose, and we choose an odd number of indices from the set S_j = { i : a_i has bit j }.

    However, we can also note: the value we assign to x_i is the OR of all the bits j that we assign to it. But if we set multiple bits arbitrarily, we might exceed a_i? 

    Actually, we can avoid this by setting exactly the bits that are in a_i and that we are forced to set? 

    But here is a key: the condition for x_i to be <= a_i is that x_i must be a subset of the bits of a_i? Not exactly: the condition is that for each bit j in x_i, the bit j must be set in a_i, and also for any bit j that is set in x_i, then if we consider the bits above j, we must have that the prefix of x_i (the higher bits) is <= the prefix of a_i? 

    However, note: we are setting bits arbitrarily and independently? 

    Alternate known solution from the sample:

        Sample 1: [3,7,1] -> T = 3|7|1 = 7.
        Assignment: [3,5,1] -> 3^5^1 = 7.

        How was 5 chosen? 5 is 101 in binary. 7 is 111. So the second member sets 101.

        Why is 5 <= 7? yes.

        How to compute 5? 
          For the highest bit (bit2): T has bit2 (since 7 has 111). 
          We need an odd number of the a_i that have bit2: 
             3: 11 -> has bit2? 3 in binary: 11 -> actually only 2 bits? 
             Let's use 60 bits.

          Actually, for j=0: 
            T has bit0? 7 has bit0 -> set. 
            Which a_i have bit0? 
                3: 11 -> has bit0? 1 (yes)
                7: 111 -> has bit0? 1 (yes)
                1: 1 -> has bit0? 1 (yes)
            So we have 3 indices -> odd? yes, so we set bit0 in all? -> then x0, x1, x2 get bit0? 
          j=1:
            T has bit1? 7 has bit1 -> set.
            Which a_i have bit1?
                3: has bit1? 3 in binary: 11 -> bit1 is set? yes.
                7: 111 -> bit1 set -> yes.
                1: 1 -> bit1? no (only bit0 set).
            So we have 2 indices -> even -> we remove one (say the last one: remove index1? but wait, we have indices0,1). Actually we have indices0 and index1. So we remove one, say we remove index1 -> then we set bit1 in index0 only?
          j=2:
            T has bit2? 7 has bit2 -> set.
            Which a_i have bit2?
                3: 11 -> bit2? no (because 3 < 4).
                7: 111 -> bit2 set -> yes (since 4<=7, so bit2 is the third bit? actually 7 is 111 -> bit0, bit1, bit2? bit2 is 4, and 7 has 4, so yes).
                1: no.
            So we have one index (index1). Then we set bit2 in index1.

          Then we have:
            x0: bit0 and bit1 -> 0b11 = 3
            x1: bit0 and bit2 -> 0b101 = 5? 
            x2: bit0 -> 1

          Then 3^5^1 = 3^5=6, 6^1=7 -> correct.

          But why is x1=5 <=7? yes.

          However, note: when we set bit1 in x0: is that safe? 
            x0 = 3, and a0=3 -> safe.
          x1: we set bit0 and bit2 -> 1 | 4 = 5 <=7 -> safe.

          But what if we had set bit1 in x0 and then bit2 in x1? Is there a constraint that we broke? Not in this case.

        However, what if we have a_i that has the j-th bit set, but if we set too many bits we exceed? 

        Example: a_i = 3 (binary 11). 
          We want to set bit0 and bit1: then x_i = 3, which is <=3 -> safe.
          But what if we set bit0 and bit2? Then we get 5, which is >3 -> invalid.

        How do we avoid setting bit2 in x_i when a_i=3? We don't set it because in the j=2 step, we check: does a_i have bit2? For a_i=3, bit2 is not set -> so we skip.

        Therefore, we are only setting bits j for which a_i has the bit. But note: the problem is that if we set multiple bits, the OR might exceed a_i? 

        Why? Because the OR of the bits we set might set a bit that is not in a_i? Actually, we are setting only bits that are in a_i? So each bit we set is in a_i. Then the OR of bits that are in a_i is always <= a_i? 

        Let me prove: 
          Let S be the set of bits we set for x_i. Then for every bit j in S, we have that the j-th bit is set in a_i. 
          Then x_i is the OR of the bits in S. 
          Since a_i has all the bits in S, and a_i is at least the OR of the bits in S? Actually, the OR of the bits in S is the maximum number that has exactly the bits in S? and since a_i has at least the bits in S, then x_i <= a_i? 

        But wait: what if a_i has the bits in S, but also has higher bits? Then the OR of the bits in S is less than a_i? 

        Example: a_i = 5 (101) and we set bits0 and bit1: then x_i = 3 (11) which is <=5 -> safe.

        However, what if a_i has the bits in S, but the OR of the bits in S might be greater than a_i? 

        Actually, no: because the OR of the bits in S is the maximum number that has exactly those bits? and if a_i has all those bits, then the OR of the bits in S is <= a_i? 

        Why? Consider: if a_i has the bits in S, then the number formed by the OR of the bits in S has no bit outside S, and for each bit in S, a_i has that bit so a_i is at least the value of the OR? 

        Actually, the OR of the bits in S is the number that has 1 in every bit in S and 0 elsewhere. Since a_i has 1 in every bit in S, then the OR of the bits in S is <= a_i? 

        Not necessarily: consider if a_i has the bits in S, but also has a higher bit? Then the OR of the bits in S is less than a_i? 

        But what if a_i has the bits in S and also has a lower bit that we did not set? Then the OR of the bits in S is still <= a_i? 

        Actually, the OR of the bits in S is the number that has all the bits in S set and the rest 0. Since a_i has at least the bits in S set, then the OR of the bits in S is a subset of the bits of a_i? 

        However, consider: 
          a_i = 5 (binary 101) and S = {bit0, bit2}. Then the OR is 101 = 5, which is <=5 -> safe.
          a_i = 5 (101) and S = {bit0, bit1} -> the OR is 011 (binary) = 3, which is <=5 -> safe.

        Actually, it is always true: if we set a set of bits S that are all present in a_i, then the OR of these bits is the number that has exactly the bits in S. And since a_i has at least these bits (and possibly more), then the number with exactly the bits in S is less than or equal to a_i? 

        Why? Because if we consider the binary representation, the number with bits S is the maximum number that has no bit outside S? And a_i has all the bits in S, so if we clear all the bits in a_i that are not in S, we get the OR of the bits in S. And that number is <= a_i.

        Therefore, the construction is safe: we set bits j that are in a_i arbitrarily and the result x_i is the OR of the bits we set, which is <= a_i.

    Therefore, the algorithm:

      T = a1 | a2 | ... | an

      Initialize an array x of n zeros.

      For each bit j from 0 to 60 (since 10^18 < 2^60, we go up to 60 is safe, but 60 inclusive? 2^60 is about 1e18, but 10^18 is about 2^59.something, so we go to 60 inclusive to cover 2^60 which is about 1.15e18, and the input can be 10^18, so we need up to 60 bits).

        Let mask = 1 << j.

        If T has the j-th bit set (i.e., T & mask != 0):
            Let L = []   # list of indices i such that a_i has the j-th bit set.

            For i in [0, n-1]:
                if a_i & mask: 
                    L.append(i)

            If the length of L is even, then we remove one element (so that we have an odd number of indices to set the j-th bit). We can remove the last one (or any one arbitrarily).

            Then for each index i in L (after removal if needed), set the j-th bit in x_i: 
                x_i = x_i | mask.

      Then output T and the list x.

    However, note: when we remove one element, we are breaking the set arbitrarily. But it is valid because we only require that the j-th bit is set in an odd number of the x_i. And we are setting it for |L|-1 (which is odd) if originally even.

    But what if L is empty? Then we cannot set the j-th bit? However, if T has the j-th bit set, then by definition T = OR of a_i, so at least one a_i must have the j-th bit set. Therefore, L is non-empty.

    Therefore, the code:

      T = 0
      for each a_i: T |= a_i

      x = [0]*n

      for j in range(0, 61):
          mask = 1 << j
          if T & mask:
              indices = []
              for i in range(n):
                  if a[i] & mask:
                      indices.append(i)
              if len(indices) % 2 == 0:
                  # remove the last one? or any one? we remove the last one for simplicity.
                  indices.pop()
              for i in indices:
                  x[i] |= mask

    Example: Sample 2: [3,2,3,3] -> T = 3|2|3|3 = 3 (binary 11)

      j=0: mask=1, T has bit0? 3 has bit0 -> yes.
          indices: 
            a0=3 -> has bit0 -> index0
            a1=2 -> no bit0? (2 is 10) -> skip
            a2=3 -> index2
            a3=3 -> index3
          indices = [0,2,3] -> odd? no, 3 is odd? wait: 3 is odd -> actually we have 3 indices -> odd? so we don't remove? 
          Then set bit0 in x0, x2, x3 -> x0=1, x2=1, x3=1.

      j=1: mask=2, T has bit1? 3 has bit1 -> yes.
          indices: 
            a0=3 -> has bit1 -> index0
            a1=2 -> has bit1? 2 has the next bit? 2 in binary: 10 -> so bit1 is set -> index1
            a2=3 -> index2
            a3=3 -> index3
          indices = [0,1,2,3] -> even -> remove last -> [0,1,2]
          Then set bit1 in x0, x1, x2: 
            x0: 1 | 2 = 3
            x1: 0 | 2 = 2 -> but wait, a1=2, so 2 is allowed? yes.
            x2: 1 | 2 = 3
            x3: 1 (from bit0)

          Now, the XOR: 
            x0=3, x1=2, x2=3, x3=1 -> 3^2=1, 1^3=2, 2^1=3 -> which is T=3.

          However, the sample output is: 3 0 3 3 -> which gives 3^0=3, 3^3=0, 0^3=3 -> so also 3.

          Why is our assignment different? 
          But note: the problem says: "If there are multiple possible answers, output any one of them."

      So we output: 
          3
          3 2 3 1

      But the sample output is: 
          3
          3 0 3 3

      Both are valid.

    However, note: the sample output is 3 0 3 3 -> 
        x0=3: 3<=3 -> ok
        x1=0: 0<=2 -> ok
        x2=3: 3<=3 -> ok
        x3=3: 3<=3 -> ok
        and 3^0^3^3 = (3^3)=0, then 0^3=3, then 3^3=0? -> actually: 
          We do: 3^0 = 3, then 3^3=0, then 0^3=3 -> so 3.

    So both are valid.

    Therefore, we output the assignment we built.

    However, note: the sample input and output are provided. We must pass the sample.

    Let's run sample1:

        n=3, a=[3,7,1]

        T = 3|7|1 = 7 (binary 111)

        j=0: mask=1 -> T has bit0? yes.
            indices: 
                i0: 3 has bit0 -> yes -> [0]
                i1: 7 has bit0 -> yes -> [0,1]
                i2: 1 has bit0 -> yes -> [0,1,2] -> odd? (3) -> no removal.
            set bit0 in x0, x1, x2: x=[1,1,1]

        j=1: mask=2 -> T has bit1? yes.
            indices: 
                i0: 3 has bit1? 3: 11 -> yes -> [0]
                i1: 7 has bit1? 7: 111 -> yes -> [0,1]
                i2: 1 has bit1? 1: 01 -> no -> so [0,1] -> even -> remove last? becomes [0]
            set bit1 in x0: x0 = 1 | 2 = 3; x1=1; x2=1.

        j=2: mask=4 -> T has bit2? yes.
            indices:
                i0: 3 has bit2? 3: 11 -> 4 is 100, so 3<4 -> no -> skip.
                i1: 7 has bit2? 7>=4 -> 7 in binary: 111 -> has bit2 -> [1]
                i2: no -> [1] -> odd -> no removal.
            set bit2 in x1: x1 = 1 | 4 = 5.

        Then x = [3,5,1] -> matches sample.

    Therefore, we code accordingly.

    Note: we are iterating from j=0 to j=60 (inclusive) in increasing order. This is fine because we are setting bits independently.

    Let's code in C++.

    Steps:

      int C;
      cin >> C;
      while (C--) {
          int n;
          cin >> n;
          vector<long long> a(n);
          for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
              cin >> a[i];
          }

          long long T = 0;
          for (long long x : a) {
              T |= x;
          }

          vector<long long> x(n, 0);   // initialize to 0

          // iterate over bits 0 to 60
          for (int j = 0; j <= 60; j++) {
              long long mask = 1LL << j;
              if (T & mask) {
                  vector<int> indices;
                  for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
                      if (a[i] & mask) {
                          indices.push_back(i);
                      }
                  }
                  // if the number of indices is even, remove the last one (or any one) to make it odd.
                  if (indices.size() % 2 == 0) {
                      if (!indices.empty()) {
                          indices.pop_back();
                      }
                  }
                  for (int idx : indices) {
                      x[idx] |= mask;
                  }
              }
          }

          // Output
          cout << T << "\n";
          for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
              cout << x[i];
              if (i < n-1) cout << " ";
          }
          cout << "\n";
      }

    But note: what if the list of indices is empty? We skip the for-loop. But we already know T has the bit, so there must be at least one index? So we don't have to worry about empty list? Actually, T is the OR of a_i, so if T has the bit, then at least one a_i must have the bit. So the list is not empty.

    However, what if we have an even list of size 0? Then we skip the removal and then we do nothing. But then the bit is not set in any x_i -> then the XOR of the x_i will not have the bit, which contradicts T. So we must ensure that we set the bit in an odd number of x_i.

    Therefore, we must have at least one element to remove? But if the list is empty, we cannot set the bit? However, we have just said: if T has the bit, then the list cannot be empty. So we are safe.

    Let's test with a_i=0? 
        Then T = OR of all a_i: if one a_i is 0, then the OR will be the OR of the others. But if all are zero? then T=0.

        Then we skip the loop for j (because T has no bits set) -> then x_i remains 0 for all.

        Then XOR = 0, which is T.

        And 0<=0 -> valid.

    Therefore, the code is safe.

    But note: the input constraint: a_i can be 0.

    However, we have to be cautious: when j is 0, mask = 1. Then we check: T has the bit? if T is 0, we skip.

    So the code handles the all-zero case.

    Let's run the second sample with our method: [3,2,3,3] -> we got [3,2,3,1] but the sample output was [3,0,3,3]. 

    The problem allows any answer. So we output [3,2,3,1] and that is valid.

    However, note: the problem says "If there are multiple possible answers, output any one of them.".

    But the sample input has two test cases. The first test case we matched the sample output. The second test case we do not match the sample output, but the problem allows any.

    But the problem sample output might be different from ours? 

    We must check: the problem sample output for the second test case:

        Input: 4
               3 2 3 3

        Output: 3
                3 0 3 3

    Our output for the second test case: 
        3
        3 2 3 1

    We must verify:

        For our assignment: 
          x0=3 -> 3<=3 -> ok
          x1=2 -> 2<=2 -> ok
          x2=3 -> 3<=3 -> ok
          x3=1 -> 1<=3 -> ok
          XOR: 3^2 = 1; 1^3 = 2; 2^1 = 3 -> correct.

    So we are valid.

    But if the problem expects the sample output, it might be that they have a specific construction? 

    However, the problem says: "if there are multiple possible answers, output any one of them".

    Therefore, we output our construction.

    But note: the problem sample input and output are provided for two cases. The first case we match. The second case we don't match the assignment, but the damage is the same.

    We are not required to match the sample assignment exactly.

    Therefore, we output:

        For the second test case:
            3
            3 2 3 1

    But the sample output for the assignment is "3 0 3 3". 

    If the judge is strict, we might fail? 

    However, the problem says "output any one of them". So both are acceptable.

    We'll run the sample test case 2 as per the sample:

        a = [3,2,3,3] -> T=3.

        j=0: mask=1 -> T has bit0 -> yes.
            indices: 
                i0: 3 has bit0? -> 3: 11 -> yes -> [0]
                i1: 2: 10 -> no -> skip.
                i2: 3 -> [0,2]
                i3: 3 -> [0,2,3] -> odd? (3) -> so we don't remove.
            set: x0=1, x2=1, x3=1.

        j=1: mask=2 -> T has bit1? -> 3 has bit1? yes.
            indices:
                i0: 3 has bit1? 3: 11 -> yes -> [0]
                i1: 2: 10 -> has bit1? yes -> [0,1]
                i2: 3 -> [0,1,2]
                i3: 3 -> [0,1,2,3] -> even -> remove last: [0,1,2]
            set: x0: 1 | 2 = 3; x1: 0 | 2 = 2; x2: 1 | 2 = 3; x3 remains 1.

        Then we get [3,2,3,1].

    How to get [3,0,3,3]? 

        We need to assign:
          x0=3, x1=0, x2=3, x3=3.

        How would our algorithm produce that?

        Actually, we can adjust the removal: we are removing the last index in the list. But what if we remove a different index?

        The problem does not specify which index to remove. We can remove any index arbitrarily to make it odd.

        To get the sample output, we would have to remove index3 in the j=0 step? 

        j=0: 
            indices: [0,2,3] -> even? so we remove one. If we remove index0? then we set for indices [2,3] -> then x2=1, x3=1, x0=0.
        j=1: 
            indices: [0,1,2,3] -> even -> remove index3? then we set for indices [0,1,2] -> then x0: 0|2=2, x1: 2, x2: 1|2=3, x3:1.
            Then we have: [2,2,3,1] -> and XOR: 2^2=0, 0^3=3, 3^1=2 -> not 3.

        Alternatively, if we remove index1 in j=1? 
            j=0: remove index0? then set indices2,3: x2=1, x3=1.
            j=1: indices: [0,1,2,3] -> remove index1? then set [0,2,3]: 
                x0: 0 | 2 = 2
                x2: 1 | 2 = 3
                x3: 1 | 2 = 3
            Then we have: [2,0,3,3] -> XOR: 2^0=2, 2^3=1, 1^3=2 -> not 3.

        How to get [3,0,3,3]?

          j=0: We set bit0 in an odd number of indices? 
            We need: 
                bit0: 
                    x0: 3 -> has bit0? yes -> 1
                    x1: 0 -> 0 -> no
                    x2: 3 -> 1
                    x3: 3 -> 1
                So we have three 1's -> odd? yes.
          j=1: 
                x0: 3 -> has bit1? yes -> 1
                x1: 0 -> 0 -> no
                x2: 3 -> 1
                x3: 3 -> 1
                So we have three 1's -> odd? yes.

          How to assign?
            We want to set bit0: in x0, x2, x3 -> then x0=1, x2=1, x3=1.
            We want to set bit1: in x0, x2, x3 -> then x0=1|2=3, x2=1|2=3, x3=1|2=3, and x1=0.

          So we did not set bit1 in x1? because x1's a_i=2, which has bit1? but we did not set it. How? 

          Our algorithm for j=1: 
              indices: [0,1,2,3] -> even -> we remove one. We removed index1? then we set the others: indices0,2,3 -> then we get 3,0,3,3.

          Therefore, if we remove the index1 in the j=1 step, we get the sample output.

        How can we choose to remove index1? 

          Currently, we are removing the last element in the vector. How do we build the vector? 
            We iterate i from 0 to n-1, so the indices are added in increasing order of i.

          Then in the j=1 step, the vector is [0,1,2,3]. Removing the last element (pop_back) removes 3.

          To remove index1, we can instead remove the element at position 1? 

          But the problem does not specify which one to remove. We can remove any. 

          Why remove arbitrarily? 

          However, note: we have to be cautious: if we remove an arbitrary element, we might break the condition for lower bits? 

          Actually, the bits are independent? But note: we are setting bits in increasing order of bit index? 

          However, we are setting the bits independently and the value of x_i is the OR of the bits we set. Since we are setting the bits in increasing order, and the mask for j is independent, we can remove any index arbitrarily.

          But to match the sample output, we don't have to. The problem allows any.

          However, if we remove the last index, we get [3,2,3,1] which is valid.

          But if we want to match the sample output, we can remove the index that has the smallest a_i? or the one that has the most constrained? Actually, we don't care.

          Since the problem does not specify, we can remove any. We'll remove the last element in the vector as we built it (by popping the last element) because it is efficient.

    Therefore, we stick to:

        if the number of indices is even and non-empty, remove the last element in the vector (using pop_back).

    We'll output the assignment as described.

    However, note: the constraints say that C (test cases) is at most 100 and n is at most 100. So we can do 61 * 100 * 100 = 610000 operations per test case? worst-case? Actually, 100 test cases? But C<=100, and n<=100, so worst-case 100*100*61 = 610000 operations, which is acceptable.

    But note: the constraints say a_i up to 10^18, but we are iterating 61 bits and n up to 100, so it's 6100 per test case? and 100 test cases -> 610000 operations -> acceptable.

    Let's code accordingly.

    Important: use 1LL << j to avoid integer overflow.

    Code in C++:

        #include <iostream>
        #include <vector>
        #include <cctype>
        #include <algorithm>
        #include <cmath>
        #include <string>
        #include <iomanip>
        using namespace std;

        int main() {
            int C;
            cin >> C;
            while (C--) {
                int n;
                cin >> n;
                vector<long long> a(n);
                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                    cin >> a[i];
                }
                long long T = 0;
                for (long long num : a) {
                    T |= num;
                }

                vector<long long> x(n, 0);

                for (int j = 0; j <= 60; j++) {
                    long long mask = 1LL << j;
                    if (T & mask) {
                        vector<int> indices;
                        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                            if (a[i] & mask) {
                                indices.push_back(i);
                            }
                        }
                        if (indices.size() % 2 == 0) {
                            if (!indices.empty()) {
                                indices.pop_back();
                            }
                        }
                        for (int idx : indices) {
                            x[idx] |= mask;
                        }
                    }
                }

                cout << T << endl;
                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                    cout << x[i];
                    if (i < n-1) {
                        cout << " ";
                    }
                }
                cout << endl;
            }
            return 0;
        }

    Let's test with the provided examples.

    However, note: the sample input #1:

        2
        3
        3 7 1
        4
        3 2 3 3

    Output for the first test case: 
        T = 3|7|1 = 7 -> output 7
        then the assignment: [3,5,1] -> so "3 5 1"

    Output for the second test case: 
        T = 3 -> output 3
        assignment: [3,2,3,1] -> "3 2 3 1"

    But the sample expected the second test case to output "3 0 3 3". 

    However, the problem allows any valid assignment. 

    But if the judge expects the sample output? They should accept any valid.

    But to be safe, we can try to match the sample assignment for the second test case? 

    How? We can change the removal: remove the element that has the smallest a_i? 

    Actually, let's try to remove the element that has the smallest a_i in the set of indices for the current bit? 

    For the second test case, j=0: 
        indices: [0,2,3] -> we have to remove one? 
        a[0]=3, a[2]=3, a[3]=3 -> all same? so remove the last one? -> index3 -> then we set x0 and x2 -> then x0=1, x2=1, x3=0.

        Then j=1: 
            indices: [0,1,2,3] -> we have to remove one? 
            a[0]=3, a[1]=2, a[2]=3, a[3]=3 -> the smallest a_i is a[1]=2 -> we remove index1? 
            Then we set j=1 in indices0,2,3: 
                x0: 1 | 2 = 3
                x2: 1 | 2 = 3
                x3: 0 | 2 = 2
            Then we have: [3,0,3,2] -> XOR: 3^0=3, 3^3=0, 0^2=2 -> not 3.

    Alternatively, we remove the one with the largest a_i? 

    Actually, we don't need to match the sample output. The problem says "any".

    We'll stick to removing the last element in the vector.

    But note: the order of the vector is the order of the indices (from 0 to n-1). So removing the last element is the one with the largest index.

    This is efficient and simple.

    We run the second test case: 
        j=0: indices = [0,2,3] -> even? 3 is odd? no, 3 is odd -> wait: 3 is odd? so we don't remove? 
        Actually, 3 % 2 = 1 -> odd -> so we don't remove -> then we set all: x0=1, x2=1, x3=1.
        j=1: indices = [0,1,2,3] -> even -> remove the last (index3) -> then set indices0,1,2: 
            x0: 1 | 2 = 3
            x1: 0 | 2 = 2
            x2: 1 | 2 = 3
            x3: 1 -> unchanged.
        Then we get [3,2,3,1] -> which is valid.

    How to get the sample output [3,0,3,3]? 
        We would have to remove index1 in the j=1 step? but we removed index3. 

        How about if we change the order of the indices? We can change the order arbitrarily? 

        Actually, we built the vector by iterating i from 0 to n-1. To remove index1, we could remove the element at position 1? 

        We can do: 
            if the list is even, remove the element at the last position? or we can remove the element at the second position? 

        But the problem does not specify.

        Alternatively, we can remove the first element? 

        Actually, we can remove any element arbitrarily. We can remove the first element to see:

            j=0: indices=[0,2,3] -> odd -> no removal.
            j=1: indices=[0,1,2,3] -> even -> remove the first element? then we remove index0 -> then we set indices1,2,3: 
                x1: 0 | 2 = 2
                x2: 1 | 2 = 3
                x3: 1 | 2 = 3
            Then we have: x0=1, x1=2, x2=3, x3=3 -> [1,2,3,3] -> XOR: 1^2=3, 3^3=0, 0^3=3 -> valid.

        Then we output: 3
                       1 2 3 3

        But the sample output is "3 0 3 3", which is different.

        How about remove the element at position 1 (the second element) in the j=1 step? 
            indices: [0,1,2,3] -> remove the element at index1 (which is 1) -> then we set indices0,2,3: 
                x0: 1 | 2 = 3
                x2: 1 | 2 = 3
                x3: 1 | 2 = 3
                x1: remains 0? -> but we didn't set x1 at all? 
            Then we get [3,0,3,3] -> which is the sample output.

        How to do that? We can remove the element at a fixed position? 

        But note: we want to be efficient and the list is small. We can remove the element at the middle? 

        Actually, we can do: 
            if the list is even, remove the element at the first position? or the last? or the middle? 

        But the problem does not specify.

        However, the sample expects the second test case to output "3 0 3 3". 

        We can change the removal to remove the second element? 

        Actually, we can remove the element that is the last one we pushed? (which is the last element) -> that's what pop_back does. 

        How about we remove the element at the position that is the size-1? 

        But to get the sample output, we need to remove the element at position1 (the second element) in the j=1 step. 

        How can we decide? 

        Alternatively, we can note: we are free to remove any. Why not remove the element that has the smallest a_i? 

        In the j=1 step for the second test case: 
            indices: [0,1,2,3] -> a_i: 3,2,3,3 -> the smallest a_i is 2 at index1. 
            So we remove index1? 

        Then we set the others: 0,2,3 -> then we get [3,0,3,3] for the assignment? 

        How: 
            j=0: we set [0,2,3] -> x0=1, x2=1, x3=1.
            j=1: we remove index1 (because it has the smallest a_i=2) -> then set 0,2,3: 
                x0: 1 | 2 = 3
                x2: 1 | 2 = 3
                x3: 1 | 2 = 3
            x1 remains 0.

        Then we get [3,0,3,3] -> sample output.

        Why remove the smallest a_i? 

        Because if we set the bit in a spellcaster that has a small a_i, we might force that spellcaster to set a bit that might cause a problem for a higher bit? Actually, we are setting from low to high, so it's independent? 

        But note: the value we set for a spellcaster is the OR of the bits we set. If we set a bit in a spellcaster that has a small a_i, then when we set a higher bit, the OR might exceed a_i? 

        However, we have already set lower bits? and the OR of the bits we set so far is <= a_i? 

        Actually, we are setting the bits independently and the OR of the bits we set is the maximum value? and it must be <= a_i? 

        But the value we set is the OR of the bits we set. Since we set only bits that are in a_i, the OR so far is <= a_i? 

        However, when we set a higher bit, we are adding a higher bit and the value becomes: previous OR | (1<<j). Since the previous OR is <= a_i, and a_i has the j-th bit, then the new value is <= a_i? 

        Why? Because the previous OR is at most a_i, and the j-th bit is set in a_i, then the new value is at most a_i? 

        Actually, no: consider a_i=5 (binary 101). We have set the 0th bit -> then x_i=1. Then we set the 1st bit -> then x_i=1|2=3, which is <=5. Then we set the 2nd bit? -> then x_i= 1|2|4 =7 -> but 7>5 -> invalid.

        How did we get the 2nd bit? We set it only if a_i has the 2nd bit? a_i=5 has the 2nd bit? 5 in binary: 101 -> the 2nd bit is set? yes. 

        But then the OR of the bits we set (0,1,2) is 7, which is greater than 5.

        This is a problem! 

        Therefore, our initial assumption that we can set bits arbitrarily is flawed.

        We must ensure that when we set the j-th bit in x_i, the current value of x_i (which already has some lower bits set) OR (1<<j) is <= a_i? 

        Actually, the OR of the bits we set is the value we are going to assign. And we are setting the bits independently without checking the current value? 

        How to fix?

        We need to check: when setting the j-th bit in x_i, we must ensure that the current value of x_i (with the j-th bit set) is <= a_i? 

        But note: the current value of x_i is the OR of the bits we set so far (for bits < j) and then we add the j-th bit. 

        How to check without storing the current value? 

        Actually, we are storing the current value in x_i. So we can do:

          if (x_i | mask) <= a_i, then we can set the j-th bit? 

        But wait: we are building the x_i from low to high. The current x_i is the value we have built so far (for bits 0 to j-1). Then we want to set the j-th bit: then the new value would be x_i | mask.

        However, we are currently in the j-th bit. We haven't set the j-th bit yet. 

        Therefore, we can do:

          We only include index i in the list for the j-th bit if (x_i | mask) <= a_i? 

        But note: we are setting the j-th bit independently in multiple indices? and we require an odd number? 

        However, if we filter the indices by this condition, we might break the requirement that we have an odd number? 

        How?

        For the j-th bit, we start with the set S = { i : a_i has the j-th bit set }.

        But we have already set some bits (for bits < j) in x_i. Then the condition to set the j-th bit in x_i is: (x_i | mask) <= a_i.

        However, note: a_i has the j-th bit set. Then the maximum value we can form for x_i is the OR of the bits we set? and the OR of the bits we set (including the j-th bit) is the current x_i (for bits < j) OR mask OR ... (but we haven't set the higher bits) -> actually we are setting the j-th bit now, and we haven't set the higher bits? 

        Since we are setting from low to high, the higher bits are not set. Then the value we would have after setting the j-th bit is x_i_so_far | mask.

        And we require that this value <= a_i.

        But is that always true? 

        Actually, no: consider a_i=5 (binary 101) and we have set the 0th and 1st bits -> then x_i_so_far= 0b11 = 3. Then mask for the 2nd bit is 4. Then x_i_so_far | mask = 7, which is >5.

        Therefore, we cannot set the 2nd bit? even though a_i has the 2nd bit set? 

        So what do we do?

        We have to avoid setting the j-th bit if it would make x_i exceed a_i.

        Therefore, we modify: 

          For the j-th bit, we collect indices i such that:
              (a_i has the j-th bit set) AND ( (x_i | mask) <= a_i )

          Then we have the list L. Then if the size of L is even, we remove one arbitrarily? 

          But note: we must set the j-th bit in an odd number of indices? 

          However, if the list L is empty? then we cannot set the j-th bit? but then the XOR won't have the j-th bit? which contradicts T.

        How to ensure that we can set the j-th bit? 

        We must have at least one index i that satisfies the condition? 

        Why must there be at least one? 

          T has the j-th bit -> so there is at least one a_i that has the j-th bit set. But that a_i might fail the condition (x_i | mask) <= a_i? 

        How can that happen? 

          Example: a_i = 5 (101) and we have set the 0th and 1st bits (so x_i=3) -> then 3 | 4 = 7 >5 -> fails.

          Then we cannot set the j-th bit? 

        Then the XOR will not have the j-th bit? but T has the j-th bit -> we are forced to set it? 

        This breaks our algorithm.

        Therefore, we must ensure that for at least one index i with the j-th bit set, we have (x_i | mask) <= a_i.

        How to guarantee that? 

        Note: the current value of x_i is the OR of the bits we set so far (bits < j). Since we set only bits that are in a_i and for bits < j, the value x_i is at most the OR of the bits below j that are in a_i? 

        But a_i has the j-th bit set. Then the number formed by the bits below j in a_i is at most (mask-1). And then if we set the j-th bit, the value becomes mask + (the bits below j we set). 

        But note: the bits below j we set might be arbitrary? 

        Actually, we set the bits below j arbitrarily? 

        How about we set the bits below j to the maximum possible? 

        But we set the bits arbitrarily to form the XOR? 

        Alternate approach: we set the bits in descending order (from high to low). Then when we set a bit j, we haven't set any lower bits? Then the current value is 0 for the lower bits? Then the new value is mask. And since a_i has the j-th bit set, then mask <= a_i? -> so (0 | mask) = mask <= a_i.

        Therefore, if we process the bits from high to low, the condition is automatically satisfied: we can always set the j-th bit in any index i that has the j-th bit set.

        Then we avoid the problem.

        Why? 

          Consider the example: a_i=5 (101). 
            j=2 (high bit): mask=4 -> we can set it? condition: (0 | 4)<=5 -> true -> we set it -> x_i=4.
            j=1: mask=2 -> condition: (4 | 2)=6>5 -> we cannot set it? 
            j=0: mask=1 -> condition: (4 | 1)=5<=5 -> set it -> then x_i=5.

          Then we get 5, which is valid.

        But note: we need an odd number of indices for each bit? 

        How does the algorithm change?

          We traverse j from high to low (say 60 down to 0).

          For each bit j that is set in T:
              We form the list L of indices i such that a_i has the j-th bit set AND (x_i | mask) <= a_i? 
                  But note: we haven't set any higher bit? Actually, we set the higher bits already? 

          Actually, we set the higher bits (j' > j) already? Then the current x_i is the OR of the higher bits we set. 

          Then we want to set the j-th bit: the new value would be x_i | mask. But we must check if that is <= a_i.

          Since we are setting from high to low, the current x_i has the higher bits set. And mask is the j-th bit. Then x_i | mask = x_i + mask? 

          Actually, not if x_i has a bit that is set below j? but we haven't set any bit below j. So the bits below j are 0. Then x_i | mask = x_i | mask = x_i + mask (since mask is a single bit and x_i has no bits in the j-th position or below? because we haven't set them). 

          But note: the current x_i has the bits we set for bits higher than j? and mask is the j-th bit, so they don't overlap. Then x_i | mask = x_i + mask.

          Condition: x_i + mask <= a_i.

          Since a_i has the j-th bit set, the number formed by the bits above j in a_i is at least the current x_i? 

          Actually, the current x_i is a subset of the bits of a_i above j? 

          But we set the bits arbitrarily? 

          How do we know that x_i is <= a_i? 

          Actually, we set the higher bits arbitrarily? and we checked the condition at each step? 

          Therefore, at the j-th step, we have x_i <= a_i (because we only set bits that are in a_i and we checked the condition at the higher bits). 

          Then we require: x_i + mask <= a_i? 

          Why might this fail? 

            Example: a_i = 5 (101) -> 
                j=2: mask=4 -> x_i=0 -> 0+4<=5 -> set -> x_i=4.
                j=1: mask=2 -> x_i=4 -> 4+2=6>5 -> skip.
                j=0: mask=1 -> x_i=4 -> 4+1=5<=5 -> set -> x_i=5.

          Then we get 5.

          But note: the condition for the j-th bit is: we can set it only if x_i + mask <= a_i.

          Then we form the list L for the j-th bit: the indices i that have the j-th bit in a_i and satisfy x_i+mask<=a_i.

          Then we require that the size of L is odd? 

          How to ensure that? 

          We can set the j-th bit arbitrarily in the indices of L? but we need an odd number? 

          Then we do:

            If the size of L is even, we remove one element arbitrarily? 

          But note: if we remove one, then we set the j-th bit in an odd number of indices? 

          However, what if the list L is empty? then we cannot set the j-th bit? but then the XOR won't have the j-th bit? which contradicts T.

          Therefore, we must ensure that the list L is non-empty? 

          Why must it be non-empty? 

            T has the j-th bit -> so there is at least one a_i that has the j-th bit set. But does that a_i satisfy x_i+mask<=a_i? 

          Since a_i has the j-th bit set, then the number formed by the bits above j in a_i is at least the current x_i? 

          Actually, let the current x_i be the bits we set for bits above j. Then the maximum value we can set for the bits above j is the bits above j in a_i. Then the remaining part (the j-th bit and below) can be set arbitrarily? 

          But we have to set the j-th bit? then the value would be x_i + mask + (some bits below j) -> but we haven't set the bits below j? and we are not forced to set them? 

          Actually, we are only setting the j-th bit now. The bits below j will be set later? 

          Then the condition we are checking is: x_i + mask <= a_i? 

          But note: we are going to set the bits below j arbitrarily? then the total value might exceed a_i? 

          Actually, we are setting the bits independently? and the total value is the OR of the bits we set? 

          However, if we set the j-th bit now, then the value becomes x_i | mask = x_i + mask (since no overlap). Then we have to set the bits below j: but we can set them arbitrarily as long as the total value is <= a_i? 

          But the condition for the bits below j: we can set them arbitrarily as long as the bits we set are in a_i? 

          Actually, we can set the bits below j arbitrarily? because the value after setting the j-th bit is x_i+mask, and then adding any subset of bits below j will not exceed a_i? 

          Why? 

            The maximum we can add from bits below j is (mask-1). Then the total would be x_i+mask+(mask-1) = x_i + 2*mask - 1.

          But we require that x_i+mask <= a_i? and then we add at most mask-1 -> then the total is at most a_i + (mask-1) -> which might be greater than a_i? 

          Therefore, we cannot set the j-th bit arbitrarily? 

          Actually, we must ensure that after setting the j-th bit and then setting the bits below j, the value remains <= a_i? 

          How to ensure that? 

          We cannot know the future? 

        This becomes complex.

        Known solution: we can use the greedy algorithm for the maximum XOR problem? 

        Alternatively, we can use the known fact: the maximum XOR is the OR of all a_i? 

        And then we can assign:

          Let x_0 = a_0
          Let x_1 = a_1
          ...
          But then the XOR might not be T.

        Another known solution from the sample: 

          We can assign:
            x_0 = a_0
            x_1 = a_1
            ...
            x_{n-2} = a_{n-2}
            x_{n-1} = T ^ x_0 ^ x_1 ^ ... ^ x_{n-2}

          But we require 0<=x_{n-1}<=a_{n-1}? 

          How to ensure that? 

          Let S = x_0 ^ x_1 ^ ... ^ x_{n-2}. Then we want x_{n-1} = T ^ S.

          But we require T^S <= a_{n-1}? 

          This is not guaranteed.

        Given the complexity, and the fact that the sample solution in the editorial (which sets the bits in increasing order) passed the sample, and the flaw we found (setting the 0th and 1st bit then the 2nd bit might exceed a_i) might not occur in the sample because the a_i are large enough? 

        How to avoid the flaw? 

          We set the bits in descending order (high to low) and then we don't set the bits below j yet. Then the condition for the j-th bit is: x_i + mask <= a_i? 
          This condition might fail, but then we skip the index? 

          But then we might not have an odd number of indices? 

        After careful thought, we note that the known solution that sets the bits in increasing order and does not check the condition is widely used in online judges for this exact problem and has passed. 

        Why is that? 

        Because the value we assign to x_i is the OR of the bits we set, and we set only bits that are in a_i. Then the value is <= a_i? 

        But we had a counterexample: a_i=5, setting bits0 and bit1 (value=3) and then bit2 (value=7) -> which is 7>5. 

        However, in that counterexample, would bit2 be set? 

          For a_i=5, bit2 is set? -> yes.
          In the increasing order, for bit0 and bit1: 
            bit0: 
                T has bit0? 5 has bit0? -> yes, so we include it.
                Then we set bit0 in x_i.
            bit1:
                T has bit1? 5 in binary: 101 -> bit1 is 0? -> wait, 5 has bit0 and bit2. 
                So bit1 is not set in T? 

          Therefore, we wouldn't set bit1? 

        Then the value after bit0 is 1, and then bit2: mask=4 -> then condition: 1+4=5<=5 -> then we set bit2 -> x_i=5.

        So the counterexample we had (setting bit0 and bit1 and then bit2) wouldn't happen because bit1 is not set in T.

        Therefore, if T has the bit, then a_i must have the bit, and the value we are setting for x_i is the OR of the bits we set (which are a subset of the bits of a_i) -> then the OR is <= a_i.

        Why? 

          Because the OR of a subset of the bits of a_i is the number that has exactly those bits, and since a_i has at least those bits, the number is <= a_i.

        Therefore, the initial algorithm (setting from low to high) is safe.

        The flaw in the counterexample was that bit1 was not in T, so we wouldn't set it.

        Therefore, we go back to the initial algorithm.

        Summary: 
          T = a0 | a1 | ... | a_{n-1}
          x_i = 0 for all i.
          for j in 0..60:
             if T has the j-th bit:
                 L = list of indices i such that a_i has the j-th bit.
                 if L has even size, remove one element (e.g., the last) to make it odd.
                 for each i in L: 
                     x_i = x_i | (1<<j)

        This is safe because the value x_i is the OR of the bits we set, and we set only bits that are in a_i, and the OR of any subset of the bits of a_i is <= a_i.

        Therefore, we output this algorithm.

        We will output for the second test case: [3,2,3,1] and it is valid.

        Code accordingly.
