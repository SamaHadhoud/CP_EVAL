To solve this problem, we need to decompose a given matrix \( A \) into the sum of the minimal number of absolutely symmetric matrices. An absolutely symmetric matrix \( T \) satisfies \( |T_{i,j}| = |T_{j,i}| \) for all \( i, j \). If no such decomposition exists, we should return \(-1\).

### Approach
1. **Check for Decomposability**: For every off-diagonal pair \((i, j)\) where \( i < j \), the sum \( A_{i,j} + A_{j,i} \) must be even. If any pair violates this condition, decomposition is impossible, and we return \(-1\).
2. **Check Absolute Symmetry**: If the matrix \( A \) itself is absolutely symmetric (i.e., \( |A_{i,j}| = |A_{j,i}| \) for all \( i, j \)), then \( k = 1 \) suffices, and we output \( A \) as the only matrix in the decomposition.
3. **Decompose into Two Matrices**: If \( A \) is not absolutely symmetric, we decompose it into two absolutely symmetric matrices \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \):
   - **Matrix \( X_1 \)**:
     - Diagonal entries are \( 0 \).
     - Off-diagonal entries are \( (A_{i,j} - A_{j,i}) / 2 \).
   - **Matrix \( X_2 \)**:
     - Diagonal entries are the same as \( A \).
     - Off-diagonal entries are \( (A_{i,j} + A_{j,i}) / 2 \).

### Solution Code
```python
import sys

def main():
    data = sys.stdin.read().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    A = []
    index = 1
    for i in range(n):
        row = list(map(int, data[index:index+n]))
        index += n
        A.append(row)
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if (A[i][j] + A[j][i]) % 2 != 0:
                print(-1)
                return
                
    is_abs_sym = True
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if abs(A[i][j]) != abs(A[j][i]):
                is_abs_sym = False
                break
        if not is_abs_sym:
            break
            
    if is_abs_sym:
        print(1)
        for i in range(n):
            print(" ".join(map(str, A[i])))
    else:
        print(2)
        X1 = []
        for i in range(n):
            row = []
            for j in range(n):
                if i == j:
                    row.append(0)
                else:
                    row.append((A[i][j] - A[j][i]) // 2)
            print(" ".join(map(str, row)))
        
        for i in range(n):
            row = []
            for j in range(n):
                if i == j:
                    row.append(A[i][i])
                else:
                    row.append((A[i][j] + A[j][i]) // 2)
            print(" ".join(map(str, row)))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a matrix \( A \) of size \( n \times n \).
2. **Even Sum Check**: For each off-diagonal pair \((i, j)\), we check if \( A_{i,j} + A_{j,i} \) is even. If any pair fails this check, we immediately return \(-1\).
3. **Absolute Symmetry Check**: We verify if \( A \) is absolutely symmetric by ensuring \( |A_{i,j}| = |A_{j,i}| \) for all \( i, j \). If true, \( A \) is printed as the sole matrix in the decomposition.
4. **Decomposition into Two Matrices**: If \( A \) is not absolutely symmetric:
   - **Matrix \( X_1 \)** is constructed with zeros on the diagonal and off-diagonal entries as \( (A_{i,j} - A_{j,i}) / 2 \).
   - **Matrix \( X_2 \)** is constructed with diagonal entries from \( A \) and off-diagonal entries as \( (A_{i,j} + A_{j,i}) / 2 \).
5. **Output**: The matrices \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \) are printed, ensuring their entries are integers within the specified bounds.

This approach efficiently checks for decomposability and constructs the minimal decomposition when possible, adhering to the problem constraints.
