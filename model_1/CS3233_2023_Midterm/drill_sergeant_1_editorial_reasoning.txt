Okay, let me tackle this problem step by step. The problem involves handling a dynamic set of cats in a line, where cats are always sorted by their height (which is their ID since height i corresponds to cat i). After each insertion or removal, we need to compute the total discontentment of all cats in the line, which depends on their adjacent cats and predefined dislike relationships.

First, note the constraints: n can be up to 10^9, m up to 100,000, and q up to 300,000. This suggests that we cannot iterate over the entire set of cats (since the line could be large) or over all dislike pairs for each query. We need an efficient approach.

Key Observations:

1. **Dynamic Line Operations**: The line is always sorted by cat height (ID). So, when we insert or remove a cat, the line remains sorted. Therefore, at any time, the line is a sorted list of distinct integers (cat IDs).

2. **Adjacency in Line**: For any cat in the line, its adjacent cats are its immediate predecessor and successor in the sorted order. Since the line is sorted, we can use the concept of "previous" and "next" cats in the set.

3. **Discontentment Calculation**: The discontentment for a cat i depends on:
   - Whether it dislikes the cat in front (previous) and/or the cat behind (next).
   - The values are:
     - 3233: if both adjacent cats are disliked.
     - 323: if only the front (previous) is disliked.
     - 32: if only the behind (next) is disliked.
     - 3: if neither adjacent cat is disliked (or if one or both are absent, but note: the cat must have both adjacent cats present to have both disliked? Actually, the problem states "dislikes both cats directly in front and behind", meaning both must exist and be disliked. If a cat is at the end, it has only one adjacent cat.

   However, note that the discontentment is defined only for cats in the line. Also, the adjacent cats must exist. For example, the first cat has no front, so it can only dislike the cat behind? Similarly, the last cat has no behind. Therefore, for a cat to have both adjacent cats, it must not be at either end.

   But the problem says "if cat recruit i dislikes both cats directly in front and behind them". So, if the cat is in the middle (has both front and behind), and dislikes both, then 3233. If it has a front but no behind, and dislikes the front, then it should be 323? But wait, the problem states:

   - 323: if cat recruit i dislikes the cat directly in front (and not the cat directly behind them). This implies that the cat behind either doesn't exist or exists but isn't disliked? Similarly for 32.

   However, note that if a cat is at the end, it might only have one adjacent cat. So, we must consider the presence of adjacent cats.

   But looking at the discontentment values:

   - If a cat has both adjacent cats present, then we check both dislikes.
   - If it has only one adjacent cat (front or back), then we can only have one dislike relation to check.

   However, the problem does not explicitly say that the discontentment for a cat with only one adjacent cat would use the same rules. Let me reread:

   "discontentment of cat recruit i is equal to:
    - 3233, if cat recruit i dislikes both cats directly in front and behind them.
    - 323, if cat recruit i dislikes the cat directly in front of them (and not the cat directly behind them).
    - 32, if cat recruit i dislikes the cat directly behind them (and not the cat directly in front of them).
    - 3, if cat recruit i does not dislike both cats directly in front and behind them."

   The key is that the last case is a catch-all: if none of the above, then 3. This includes:
   - The cat dislikes neither adjacent cat? Or only one? Actually, the conditions are exclusive: the first three conditions cover when they dislike at least one adjacent cat that exists? Not exactly.

   Actually, the conditions are:

   - Condition 1: dislikes both front and back (and both must exist? Because if one doesn't exist, then it can't dislike it). So, for condition 1 to apply, the cat must be in the middle (both adjacent present) and dislike both.

   - Condition 2: dislikes the front (so front must exist) and does not dislike the back. But what if the back doesn't exist? Then the condition "dislikes the front and not the back" is true? Because it dislikes the front and the back doesn't exist (so it cannot dislike the back). Similarly, condition 3: dislikes the back and not the front, which would hold if the back exists and is disliked, and the front either doesn't exist or exists and isn't disliked? But the condition says "and not the cat directly behind them" — but if the back doesn't exist, then the statement "does not dislike the cat behind" is true (since it doesn't exist to dislike). So:

   Actually, the condition for 323 is: dislikes the front AND does not dislike the back. This can happen in two cases:
      a) The back exists and isn't disliked.
      b) The back doesn't exist.

   Similarly for 32: dislikes the back and does not dislike the front — which can be because the front doesn't exist or exists and isn't disliked.

   The last case (3) is: if none of the above. That is:
      - If the cat is at the front (no front) and doesn't dislike the back? Then condition 3? But wait: if it's at the front and dislikes the back, then condition 3? Or condition 2? Condition 2 requires disliking the front — which doesn't exist, so condition 2 doesn't apply. Condition 3 requires disliking the back and not the front — but here, the front doesn't exist, so "not disliking the front" is true. So if it dislikes the back, then condition 3 would not be met? Actually, condition 3 is for disliking the back and not the front — which is true in this case. So:

   Let's break down by the cat's position:

   - If the cat is in the middle (both adjacent exist):
        - If dislikes both: 3233
        - Else if dislikes only front: 323
        - Else if dislikes only back: 32
        - Else: 3

   - If the cat is at the front (only back exists):
        - If dislikes the back: 32? Because condition 3: dislikes the back and not the front. But "not the front" is true (since front doesn't exist). So condition 3 applies: 32?
        - Else: 3

   - If the cat is at the back (only front exists):
        - If dislikes the front: 323? Because condition 2: dislikes the front and not the back (which is true because back doesn't exist). So 323?
        - Else: 3

   However, wait: the condition for 32 is: "dislikes the cat directly behind them (and not the cat directly in front of them)". For the frontmost cat, there is no front, so "not disliking the front" is trivially true. Therefore, if it dislikes the back, it qualifies for 32.

   Similarly, for the backmost cat, if it dislikes the front, it qualifies for 323.

   Therefore, the discontentment per cat is:

      if (hasPrev and hasNext):
          if (dislikes both) -> 3233
          else if (dislikes prev and not dislikes next) -> 323
          else if (dislikes next and not dislikes prev) -> 32
          else -> 3
      elif (hasPrev):   // only previous exists (so it's the last)
          if (dislikes prev) -> 323
          else -> 3
      elif (hasNext):   // only next exists (so it's the first)
          if (dislikes next) -> 32
          else -> 3
      else:   // only one cat in the line: no adjacent cats -> 3
          -> 3

   But note: if a cat is alone, it has neither front nor back. Then, by the above, it would fall into the last else and get 3.

   This matches the sample: after the first instruction (cat 1 moves in), the line has only cat 1. Discontentment = 3.

4. **Challenge**: The line is dynamic (insertions and removals), and we have to update the discontentment after each operation. Moreover, the discontentment of a cat depends on its neighbors, and when we insert or remove a cat, it may change the neighbors of existing cats (and hence their discontentment) and also the new cat's discontentment.

   Specifically, when inserting a cat z:

      - We need to find its immediate predecessor (prev) and successor (next) in the current set.
      - Then, we break the adjacency between prev and next (if both exist, they were adjacent before) and insert z between them. So, the adjacency between prev and next is broken, and new adjacencies are (prev, z) and (z, next).

   Therefore, the insertion affects:

      - The new cat z: we compute its discontentment based on prev and next (if they exist).
      - The previous cat (if exists): its next neighbor changes from next to z. So we must update its discontentment.
      - The next cat (if exists): its previous neighbor changes from prev to z. So we must update its discontentment.

   Similarly, when removing a cat z:

      - Let prev = predecessor of z, next = successor of z.
      - After removal, prev and next become adjacent.
      - Therefore, we need to update the discontentment of:
            - z: removed, so we subtract its discontentment.
            - prev: if exists, its next neighbor changes from z to next (or becomes nothing if next doesn't exist? Actually, after removal, prev's next becomes next, and next's prev becomes prev). But note: if z was the first, then after removal, the next becomes the new first? Similarly for last.
            - next: similarly, its previous neighbor changes from z to prev.

   So, each insertion or removal affects at most three cats: the inserted/removed cat and its two neighbors.

5. **Efficiency**: Since each operation affects only O(1) cats (the cat and its two neighbors), we can update the total discontentment by only recalculating the discontentment for these O(1) cats. However, we need to:

      - Maintain the current set of cats in the line (to find the neighbors quickly). Since q is up to 300,000, the number of cats in the line at any time is at most 300,000. We can use a balanced BST or a sorted set. In C++ we can use std::set, which gives predecessor and successor in O(log N) per operation.

      - Store the current discontentment value for each cat? Actually, we don't need to store per cat for the entire n (which is 10^9) but only for the cats currently in the line and their neighbors? But the neighbors might not be in the line? Actually, the neighbors are in the line because we are considering the line. So, we can maintain:

            total_discontentment = current total.

            When updating a cat, we subtract its old discontentment and add its new discontentment.

      Steps for insertion of z:

          Step 1: Find prev and next of z in the set (using lower_bound, etc.)

          Step 2: Remove the old discontentment of prev and next (if they exist) from the total.

          Step 3: Break the adjacency between prev and next (if both exist) by subtracting the contribution that was due to their adjacency? Actually, no. The discontentment of prev and next is computed entirely from their own neighbors. So when we insert z, the neighbors of prev and next change. Therefore, we must recalculate their discontentment.

          Step 4: Insert z, then set the neighbors: for prev, its next becomes z; for next, its prev becomes z. For z, its neighbors are prev and next.

          Step 5: Compute the discontentment for z, and the new discontentment for prev and next.

          Step 6: Add the discontentment of z, and the updated discontentment of prev and next to the total.

      Similarly for removal:

          Step 1: For the cat z to remove, get its current neighbors: prev and next.

          Step 2: Remove the discontentment of z, prev, and next from the total.

          Step 3: Remove z, then set the neighbors: prev and next become adjacent (if both exist).

          Step 4: Recompute the discontentment for prev and next (since their neighbors have changed).

          Step 5: Add the updated discontentment of prev and next to the total.

   However, note: when we remove z, the neighbors of prev and next change: prev's next becomes next (instead of z) and next's prev becomes prev (instead of z). So we update accordingly.

   Therefore, each operation requires:

        - Set insertion/deletion: O(log q) per operation (since set size is at most q, which is 300,000).
        - For each operation, we update at most 3 cats (the inserted/removed and two neighbors). For each cat, we need to check its dislike relations with its new neighbors.

6. **Handling Dislike Relations**: We are given m dislike pairs. For a cat i, we need to quickly check if it dislikes a neighbor j. Since m is 100,000, we can store the dislike pairs in a set or map. But note: the neighbors are only the immediate ones, and for each cat in the line, we only have up to two neighbors. So for each update (for a cat i), we need to check:

        - For its new previous neighbor (if exists): does (min(i,prev), max(i,prev)) exist in the dislike set?
        - Similarly for next: does (min(i,next), max(i,next)) exist?

   However, we cannot store a set of pairs with 10^9 possible cats? But m is only 100,000. We can create a set (hash set or balanced BST) of the dislike pairs. Since the pairs are given with x_i < y_i, we can represent each pair as (x, y). Then, for a pair (a, b) (with a<b), we can check in O(log m) time.

   Alternatively, for each cat, we can store the cats it dislikes? But n is 10^9, so we cannot store an array of size 10^9. Instead, we can have a map: for each cat that appears in the dislike pairs, we store the set of cats it dislikes? But again, the cats in the line are at most 300,000, but the dislike pairs involve cats that may not be in the line. However, when updating, we are only concerned with the neighbors, which are in the line. But the neighbor cat might be any number from 1 to 10^9? How do we check if cat a dislikes cat b?

   We can do:

        Define a function has_dislike(a, b) that checks if (min(a,b), max(a,b)) is in a global set of dislike pairs.

   We can store all dislike pairs in a set S (as a sorted pair). Then, for any a and b, we form the pair (min, max) and check if it exists in S. The set S has size m=100,000, so we can use a hash set or a balanced BST (set of pairs). The time per check is O(log m), which is acceptable (log(100000) is about 17).

   Alternatively, we can use an unordered_set of pairs, but we need to hash the pair. Since the numbers are up to 10^9, we can do: store each pair as a long long: if we represent (x, y) as (x * (some big number) + y), but note that n is 10^9, so x * 10^10 + y would fit in a long long (since 10^9 * 10^10 = 10^19, which is within 64 bits). Alternatively, we can use a set of pairs in C++ (which is tree-based) and the comparison is efficient.

   So, we can pre-store all the dislike pairs in a set (or unordered_set if we write a hash function).

7. **Algorithm Outline**:

   Precomputation:

        - Read n, m.
        - Store all dislike pairs (x_i, y_i) in a global set `dislikeSet` (as pairs with x_i < y_i; the input ensures x_i < y_i).
        - Read q.

   We maintain:

        - A sorted set (like std::set) `line` that stores the cats currently in the line. This allows O(log |line|) for insertion, deletion, and finding neighbors.
        - A variable `total` that stores the current total discontentment.

        Initialize: `line` is empty, `total = 0`.

   For each query (d, z):

        if d == 1 (insert z):

            - Find the position where z would be inserted. Find the next cat: use lower_bound to find the first cat >= z. Since the set is sorted, we can do:

                  auto it = line.lower_bound(z);
                  // Then, the next cat is *it (if exists), and the previous cat is the one before it (if exists).

            Actually, since we are inserting, we can do:

                  auto it = line.insert(z).first;   // This returns the iterator to the inserted element.

            But then we need to get the next and previous. Alternatively, we can do:

                  auto it = line.lower_bound(z);
                  // Because the set is sorted, the next is it (if it != line.end()), and the previous is the element before it (if it != line.begin(), then we do prev(it)).

            However, note: if we are inserting z, then we can:

                  auto next = line.lower_bound(z);   // This gives the first element >= z. Since z is not in the line (guaranteed), this gives the next cat (if any).
                  auto prev = (next == line.begin() ? line.end() : prev(next));   // Actually, we can get the previous by decrementing next if next is not begin? Or we can do:

            Better: we can do:

                  auto it = line.lower_bound(z);
                  // Then, next = it (if it != line.end())
                  // prev = if it != line.begin(), then the element before it? But wait: the element before it is the one that is less than z. Actually:

                  Let next = it;
                  Let prev = (it == line.begin() ? line.end() : prev(it));   // But if we get prev(it) when it is at begin, we get an error? So:

                  Actually, we can get:

                      prev = (it != line.begin()) ? *prev(it) : not_found;
                      next = (it != line.end()) ? *it : not_found;

            But after inserting, the neighbors of z are the prev and next we just found.

            Steps:

                Step 1: Insert z and get iterator to it. Actually, we can first find the neighbors without inserting? Because we need to know the neighbors to compute the discontentment of the neighbors and z.

                So:

                    // First, find the neighbors without inserting z.

                    auto it = line.lower_bound(z);   // first element >= z -> this will be the next after z.
                    int next = (it != line.end()) ? *it : -1;   // -1 to indicate not found.
                    int prev = -1;
                    if (it != line.begin()) {
                        auto prev_it = it;
                        prev_it--;
                        prev = *prev_it;
                    } else {
                        prev = -1;
                    }

                Now, we have the future neighbors: prev and next.

                Step 2: Remove the current discontentment of the neighbors (if they exist) from the total? Actually, because after insertion, the neighbors will have new neighbors. So we need to recalculate their discontentment.

                    Let affected_cats = {prev, next} (if they exist). But note: we also have to break the adjacency between prev and next? Actually, if both prev and next exist, then they were adjacent before. Now, they are no longer adjacent. Therefore, we must update both.

                Step 3: For each cat in {prev, next} (if exists):

                    - Subtract its current discontentment from total.
                    - Then, update its neighbor information: 
                          For prev: its next will change from next to z.
                          For next: its prev will change from prev to z.

                    But wait: we don't store the neighbors for each cat? How do we compute the discontentment for a cat? We need to know its current neighbors.

                How to store neighbors? We can maintain for each cat in the line:

                    - Its predecessor and successor? Actually, we can get them from the set. But to compute the discontentment for a cat i, we need to get its neighbors from the set. But we are already maintaining the set, so we can do:

                          For a cat i, we can get:

                              auto it = line.find(i);
                              auto prev = (it != line.begin()) ? *prev(it) : -1;
                              auto next = next(it);   // if next(it) != line.end(), then *next(it), else -1.

                    However, if we do this for every update, it would be O(log |line|) per cat. Since we update at most 3 cats per operation, total O(3 log |line|) per query, which is acceptable (log(300000) is about 19, so 3*19 = 57 per query, 300000*57 ~ 17.1e6, acceptable).

                But note: when we update a neighbor (say prev), we are changing its next neighbor. But the set for the entire line remains consistent because we are inserting z. So after inserting z, the set has the new order, and we can recompute the neighbors for any cat by querying the set.

                Therefore, we don't need to store the neighbor pointers separately. We can use the set to find the neighbors on the fly.

                However, when we remove the old discontentment for prev and next, we need to know their neighbors at that moment (before inserting z). But before inserting z, the set does not have z. So we can compute the neighbors of prev and next from the current set (without z) to get their current discontentment.

                Then, after inserting z, we compute the new neighbors for prev, next, and z to get their new discontentment.

                So the steps for insertion:

                    Step 1: Find the future neighbors of z: prev and next (from the current set without z).

                    Step 2: For each cat in {prev, next} (if they exist), compute their current discontentment (using the current set without z) and subtract it from total.

                    Why? Because after inserting z, their neighbors change. So we remove their old contribution.

                    Step 3: Insert z into the set.

                    Step 4: Now, for the cats: prev, z, next, compute their new discontentment.

                        - For prev: now its neighbors are: (the previous of prev? which hasn't changed) and its next is now z (instead of next). So we can get the neighbors of prev from the set (with z inserted) and compute its discontentment.

                        Similarly for next: its previous neighbor is now z (instead of prev).

                        For z: its neighbors are prev and next.

                    Step 5: Add the new discontentment of prev, z, and next to the total.

                But note: the neighbors of other cats (like the neighbors of the neighbors) are not changed? For example, the cat before prev: its next is still prev? Because we only inserted z between prev and next. So only prev, z, and next are affected.

                Therefore, we only need to update prev, z, and next.

                Similarly for removal.

        For removal (d == 2, remove z):

            Step 1: From the current set (with z), get the neighbors of z: prev and next.

            Step 2: For each cat in {prev, z, next}, subtract their current discontentment (computed with the current set) from the total.

            Step 3: Remove z from the set.

            Step 4: Now, for prev and next (if they exist), compute their new discontentment (because they become adjacent). Note: after removal, the neighbors of prev and next change: 
                - For prev: its next becomes next (if next exists) or nothing? 
                - For next: its prev becomes prev (if prev exists).

            Step 5: Add the new discontentment of prev and next to the total.

        However, note: when we remove z, the set changes, so we can compute the neighbors of prev and next from the new set (without z). 

        Therefore, the steps:

            Step 1: Get current neighbors of z: prev and next (using the set with z).

            Step 2: Compute the current discontentment for z, prev, and next (using the set with z) and subtract them.

            Step 3: Remove z from the set.

            Step 4: For prev and next (if they exist), compute their new discontentment (using the set without z) and add them to the total.

        Why not compute the new discontentment for prev and next after removal? Yes, that's what step 4 does.

8. **Computing Discontentment for a Cat i**:

        We have a function: `get_discontentment(i)`:

            if i is not in the set, then skip? Actually, we only call this for cats in the set.

            Steps:

                Find the neighbors of i in the set:

                    set = the current line set.

                    auto it = set.find(i);
                    if (it == set.end()) return 0; // not in set, but shouldn't happen.

                    int prev = -1, next = -1;

                    if (it != set.begin()) {
                        auto prev_it = it;
                        prev_it--;
                        prev = *prev_it;
                    }

                    auto next_it = it;
                    next_it++;
                    if (next_it != set.end()) {
                        next = *next_it;
                    }

                Now, we have:

                    has_prev = (prev != -1);
                    has_next = (next != -1);

                Then, check:

                    if (has_prev && has_next) {
                        bool dislike_prev = has_dislike(i, prev);   // check if the pair (min(i,prev), max(i,prev)) is in dislikeSet
                        bool dislike_next = has_dislike(i, next);
                        if (dislike_prev && dislike_next) {
                            return 3233;
                        } else if (dislike_prev && !dislike_next) {
                            return 323;
                        } else if (!dislike_prev && dislike_next) {
                            return 32;
                        } else {
                            return 3;
                        }
                    } else if (has_prev) {
                        // only previous exists (so i is the last)
                        if (has_dislike(i, prev)) {
                            return 323;
                        } else {
                            return 3;
                        }
                    } else if (has_next) {
                        // only next exists (so i is the first)
                        if (has_dislike(i, next)) {
                            return 32;
                        } else {
                            return 3;
                        }
                    } else {
                        // alone
                        return 3;
                    }

9. **Complexity**: Each get_discontentment(i) does two neighbor lookups (each O(log |line|)) and up to two dislike checks (each O(log m) for set of pairs). The set operations for neighbors: O(log |line|). Since |line| <= q (at most 300,000), and q up to 300,000, and each query updates at most 3 cats, the total time per query is O( (log q + log m) * 3 ). Since log q and log m are about 19, so 3*38 ~ 114 per query? Actually, for each cat we do:

        - Getting neighbors: O(log |line|) per cat? Actually, to get the neighbors for one cat, we do:

              find the cat in the set: O(log |line|)
              then one or two more operations (prev, next) which are O(1) because iterators? Actually, set iterating to next is O(1), but getting the previous requires decrementing an iterator which is O(1) in amortized? But in std::set, iterators are bidirectional, so prev and next are O(1). But the initial find is O(log |line|).

        So for one cat, we spend O(log |line|) to find it and then O(1) to get neighbors.

        Then, we do up to two dislike checks: each O(log m).

        Therefore, per cat: O(log |line| + log m).

        Per query: we update 3 cats, so 3*(log |line| + log m).

        Total time: q * 3*(log |line| + log m) = 300000 * 3*(log(300000) + log(100000)) ~ 300000 * 3*(19 + 17) = 300000 * 3 * 36 = 300000 * 108 = 32,400,000, which is acceptable in 3 seconds (C++).

10. **Edge Cases**:

        - When inserting the first cat: then both prev and next are not found. Then we only add z with discontentment 3.
        - When removing a cat that is at the end: then one of the neighbors might not exist. The algorithm handles because we check existence.

        - When the set is empty: removal shouldn't happen (by input guarantee). Similarly, insertion into an empty set: then neighbors are null.

        - When a cat is inserted and becomes the first: then prev is null, next is the old first. Then we update the old first: which used to be the first (so it had no previous) and now it has a previous (z). Therefore, we must update the old first.

        Similarly, when inserting at the end: the old last now has a next? Actually, when inserting at the end, the next is null, so we set the previous to the old last. Then the old last: its next changes from null to z? Actually, no: if we insert at the end, then the next of the inserted cat is null, and the previous is the old last. Then the old last's next becomes z. So we must update the old last.

11. **Testing with Sample Input**:

        Sample Input: 
            10 4
            1 3
            3 5
            5 7
            7 9
            13
            ... queries

        After each instruction, output the discontentment.

        We can simulate the first few steps.

        Initially: line = {}, total = 0.

        Query 1: 1 1 -> insert cat 1.

            line = {1}
            For cat 1: has_prev? no; has_next? no -> discontentment=3.
            total = 3 -> output 3.

        Query 2: 1 3 -> insert cat 3.

            Find neighbors: 
                Before insertion: set = {1}
                For z=3: 
                    next = line.lower_bound(3) -> returns end? Actually, set has {1}; lower_bound(3) returns iterator to the end? Then next = -1.
                    prev: since it != begin? but the set has one element. it = line.lower_bound(3) -> points to end? Then we do: if it != begin -> it is end, so begin is 1, so we can do: 
                        prev = (it != begin) -> it is end, but we can do: 
                        Actually, we do: 
                            it = line.lower_bound(3); // it points to end? 
                            then next = -1
                            prev = if it != begin? begin is the first element. We do: if it != begin -> but it is end, which is not begin? Actually, we do:

                            prev: if it != begin -> then we get the element before it. Since it is at end, the element before end is the last element, which is 1.

                    So prev = 1, next = -1.

            Then, we subtract the current discontentment of prev (cat 1). Currently, cat 1 has no neighbors? In the current set (without 3), cat 1 is alone -> discontentment=3. Subtract 3.

            Then, insert 3.

            Now, update:
                For cat 1: 
                    neighbors: prev: none (since it is first), next: 3? 
                    So has_next: true -> check if dislikes 1 and 3? 
                    The dislike pairs: (1,3) exists -> so cat 1 dislikes the next? 
                    Then discontentment = 32? (because it is the first, and dislikes the next -> 32).

                For cat 3: 
                    neighbors: prev=1, next=none -> so it is last. Check: dislikes 1 and 3? exists -> so dislikes the prev? 
                    Then discontentment = 323? (because it is last and dislikes the previous -> 323).

                Then total = (0 - 3) [removed old 1] + 32 (new for 1) + 323 (for 3) = 3 + 32 + 323 = 355? 

            But the sample output for the second line is 355. Then output 355.

        Query 3: 1 5 -> insert cat 5.

            Find neighbors for 5: 
                Current set: {1,3}
                it = line.lower_bound(5) -> end? so next = -1, prev = last element? which is 3.

            Then, subtract current discontentment of prev (cat 3): currently, cat 3 is last and dislikes 1 (its only neighbor) -> 323. Subtract 323.

            Insert 5.

            Now, update:
                Cat 3: now it has next (5) and still has prev (1). 
                    Check dislikes: 
                        3 and 1: exists -> dislike_prev = true.
                        3 and 5: exists (because dislike pairs: (3,5)) -> dislike_next = true.
                    Then cat 3: both -> 3233.

                Cat 5: 
                    neighbors: prev=3, next=none -> last. Check: dislikes 3 and 5? exists -> so 323.

                Also, we must update cat 1? But cat 1's neighbors: still only next is 3? Because cat 1 is first, next is 3 (still). And it dislikes 3 -> 32. So cat 1 remains 32.

                But note: we did not update cat 1? Why? Because we only updated the neighbors (prev and next) of the inserted cat? The neighbors of 3 changed: we updated 3. But the neighbors of 1 did not change: 1 still has next=3? Actually, no: the next of 1 was 3, and after inserting 5, the next of 1 is still 3? Because 1 is first, then 3, then 5. So 1's next is still 3. Therefore, we don't need to update cat 1.

            So total = (previous total 355) - 323 (old 3) + 3233 (new 3) + 323 (for 5) = 355 - 323 + 3233 + 323 = 355 + 3233 + 323 - 323 = 355 + 3233 = 3588? 

            The sample output is 3588.

        So it matches.

        However, note: when we inserted 5, we only subtracted the old discontentment of prev (which was 3) and then updated 3 and 5. But we did not subtract the old value of next? Because next was -1 (so we didn't subtract anything for next). And we didn't consider any other cat? Correct.

        Similarly, for the next query: insert 7.

            Set: {1,3,5}
            For 7: 
                next = line.lower_bound(7) -> end, so next = -1
                prev = 5 (the last element)

            Subtract current discontentment of prev (cat 5): currently, cat 5 is last and dislikes 3? Actually, cat 5 has prev=3 and no next? So it's 323 (because it dislikes 3? yes, because (3,5) exists). Subtract 323.

            Insert 7.

            Then update:
                Cat 5: now has next=7? and still has prev=3.
                    Dislikes: 5 and 3 -> exists (3,5) -> true.
                    Dislikes: 5 and 7 -> exists? (5,7) in the dislike pairs? The input has (5,7) -> yes.
                    So both: 3233.

                Cat 7: last, dislikes 5? (7,5) -> but we have (5,7) in the set? Actually, the dislike pairs: (5,7) is given. So yes. Then 323.

            Then total = 3588 - 323 + 3233 + 323 = 3588 + 3233 = 6821? Matches sample.

        Then insert 2: 
            Set: {1,3,5,7}
            For 2: 
                next = line.lower_bound(2) -> the first element >=2 -> 3? So next=3.
                prev: since next points to 3, then we get the element before 3: which is 1.

            Then subtract the current discontentment of prev (1) and next (3).

                Cat 1: currently has next=3? and no prev. Dislikes 1 and 3: yes -> so 32. Subtract 32.
                Cat 3: currently has prev=1 and next=5. Dislikes: 
                    3 and 1: yes, 3 and 5: yes -> 3233. Subtract 3233.

            Insert 2.

            Then update:
                Cat 1: now its next becomes 2? (because 1,2,3,5,7). 
                    So cat 1: next=2. Check dislike: (1,2) -> not in the dislike set? The dislikes are: (1,3), (3,5), (5,7), (7,9). So (1,2) is not there. 
                    Then cat 1: first, dislikes next? no -> 3.

                Cat 3: now its prev becomes 2? and next is still 5.
                    Check: 3 and 2: dislike? (2,3) not in the set? -> no.
                    3 and 5: yes -> so only next is disliked? Then 32? 
                    But wait: condition: if both present? yes. 
                    Then: if dislikes both: false (only next) -> then 32? 
                    Actually: 
                        3 has prev=2 and next=5.
                        dislike_prev = false, dislike_next = true -> so 32.

                Cat 2: 
                    neighbors: prev=1, next=3.
                    Check: 1 and 2: not disliked -> false.
                            2 and 3: not disliked -> false.
                    Then 3.

                And cat 5 and 7 remain unchanged? 
                    Cat 5: still has prev=3 and next=7. Dislikes both: 5 and 3: yes, 5 and 7: yes -> 3233.
                    Cat 7: still last, dislikes 5: 323.

            Then total = (previous 6821 -32 -3233) + (3 [for 1] + 32 [for 3] + 3 [for 2]) + unchanged (3233+323) 
            But wait: we are updating only 1,2,3? The total after removal of old 1 and 3 was: 6821 -32 -3233 = 3556.
            Then add: 3 (for 1) + 32 (for 3) + 3 (for 2) = 38 -> total=3556+38=3594.

            Then we add the unchanged? But we didn't subtract the others? Actually, we only subtracted 1 and 3. The others (5 and 7) were not subtracted? So they are still in the total? 

            The total before the update was 6821. We subtracted 32 (for 1) and 3233 (for 3). Then we added 3 (for 1), 32 (for 3), and 3 (for 2). Also, we have the unchanged 5 and 7: 3233+323=3556? But 3233+323=3556? Then the new total = 3556 (from 5 and 7) + 3+32+3 = 3556+38 = 3594? 

            The sample output is 3594.

        So it matches.

12. **Implementation Details**:

        We'll need:

            - A global set (or unordered_set) of pairs for the dislike pairs. Since the pairs are small, we can use a set of pairs (long long or pair<int,int>).

            - A set (sorted) for the current line.

            - A variable for the total discontentment.

        Steps for each query:

            if d == 1: 
                // Insert z
                // Step 1: Find neighbors in the current set: prev and next.
                auto it = line.lower_bound(z);
                int prev = -1, next = -1;
                if (it != line.begin()) {
                    auto prev_it = it;
                    prev_it--;
                    prev = *prev_it;
                }
                if (it != line.end()) {
                    next = *it;
                }

                // Step 2: Subtract the discontentment of prev and next (if they exist) from the total.
                if (prev != -1) {
                    total -= get_discontentment(prev);   // This function uses the current set (without z) to compute neighbors.
                }
                if (next != -1) {
                    total -= get_discontentment(next);
                }

                // Step 3: Insert z.
                line.insert(z);

                // Step 4: Recompute the discontentment for prev, z, and next (using the new set with z) and add them.
                if (prev != -1) {
                    total += get_discontentment(prev);
                }
                if (next != -1) {
                    total += get_discontentment(next);
                }
                total += get_discontentment(z);   // for the new cat

                // Output total.

            if d == 2:
                // Remove z
                // Step 1: Get current neighbors of z: prev and next (using the set with z).
                auto it = line.find(z);
                // If z is not found? guaranteed to be in the line.
                int prev = -1, next = -1;
                if (it != line.begin()) {
                    auto prev_it = it;
                    prev_it--;
                    prev = *prev_it;
                }
                auto next_it = it;
                next_it++;
                if (next_it != line.end()) {
                    next = *next_it;
                }

                // Step 2: Subtract the discontentment of z, prev, and next.
                total -= get_discontentment(z);
                if (prev != -1) {
                    total -= get_discontentment(prev);
                }
                if (next != -1) {
                    total -= get_discontentment(next);
                }

                // Step 3: Remove z.
                line.erase(it);

                // Step 4: Recompute the discontentment for prev and next (if they exist) and add them.
                if (prev != -1) {
                    total += get_discontentment(prev);
                }
                if (next != -1) {
                    total += get_discontentment(next);
                }

                // Output total.

        However, note: in the insertion step, when we compute get_discontentment(prev) in step 2, we are using the set without z. But in step 4, we use the set with z. Similarly for removal: step 2 uses set with z, step 4 uses set without z.

        How to implement get_discontentment? It uses the global set to find neighbors. So we must design the function to use the current state of the set.

        Therefore, the function `get_discontentment(i)` should:

            - Check if i is in the set? Actually, we only call it for cats that we know are in the set (except during removal: after we remove z, we call for prev and next, which are still in the set? because we removed only z). But during insertion: we call for prev and next in step 2 (without z) and then in step 4 (with z). So the set is updated.

        We must ensure that the set is in the correct state when we call get_discontentment.

        For insertion:

            Step 2: set does not have z.
            Step 4: set has z.

        For removal:

            Step 2: set has z.
            Step 4: set does not have z.

        The function `get_discontentment(i)` will use the current set (which is the global set) to compute the neighbors. So we must update the global set before calling it.

        Therefore, in the insertion code, we call get_discontentment for prev and next in step 2 (before inserting z). Then we insert z, and then call again for prev, next, and z (after insertion).

        Similarly for removal: we call get_discontentment for prev, z, next in step 2 (with z still in the set). Then we remove z, and then call for prev and next (without z).

        This should be correct.

13. **Potential Pitfall**:

        - The function get_discontentment(i) must not assume that i is in the set? Actually, we only call it for cats that are in the set? In step 2 of insertion: we are about to insert z, and we call for prev and next. But at that time, prev and next are in the set (without z). Similarly, in step 4, after inserting, they are still in the set? Yes.

        - Similarly for removal: we remove z, but we call for prev and next only after removal? And they are still in the set? Yes.

        - However, in removal: after removing z, if we call get_discontentment for a cat that is not in the set? That would be an error. But we only call for prev and next, which are still in the set (because we only removed z).

        - Also, when we get the neighbors for a cat, we must be cautious: if the set is modified during the function? But we are not modifying the set in the function.

14. **Memory**: We store the set of dislike pairs: O(m). The set for the line: O(q). Total memory: O(m + q) = 100,000 + 300,000 = 400,000, which is acceptable.

15. **Summary**:

        We maintain:
            set<long> dislikeSet;   // or set of pairs, but for has_dislike(a,b): we form the pair (min(a,b), max(a,b)) and check in the set.

            set<int> line;   // the current cats in the line.

            long long total = 0;   // the current total discontentment.

        We define:

            function has_dislike(a, b):
                if a > b: swap(a, b)
                return (dislikeSet.find({a, b}) != dislikeSet.end();

            function get_discontentment(i):
                // i is in the set? We assume so.
                auto it = line.find(i);
                // But if the set is being modified? We are in the middle of an update. But we design that during get_discontentment, the set is stable.

                int prev = -1, next = -1;
                if (it != line.begin()) {
                    auto prev_it = it;
                    prev_it--;
                    prev = *prev_it;
                }
                auto next_it = it;
                next_it++;
                if (next_it != line.end()) {
                    next = *next_it;
                }

                // Now, compute based on prev and next and has_dislike.

                if (prev != -1 && next != -1) {
                    bool d_prev = has_dislike(i, prev);
                    bool d_next = has_dislike(i, next);
                    if (d_prev && d_next) return 3233;
                    else if (d_prev) return 323;
                    else if (d_next) return 32;
                    else return 3;
                } else if (prev != -1) {
                    if (has_dislike(i, prev)) return 323;
                    else return 3;
                } else if (next != -1) {
                    if (has_dislike(i, next)) return 32;
                    else return 3;
                } else {
                    return 3;
                }

        Then, as above for the queries.

16. **Note on Performance**:

        Each get_discontentment(i) does:

            - One find in the set: O(log |line|)
            - One or two calls to has_dislike: each O(log m) if we use a set (tree-based). Or O(1) if we use unordered_set.

        We can use an unordered_set for the dislike pairs to make the dislike check O(1) average. But we need to hash the pair. We can do:

            struct pair_hash {
                template <class T1, class T2>
                std::size_t operator () (const std::pair<T1,T2> &p) const {
                    auto h1 = std::hash<T1>{}(p.first);
                    auto h2 = std::hash<T2>{}(p.second);
                    return h1 ^ (h2 << 1);
                }
            };
            unordered_set<pair<int, int>, pair_hash> dislikeSet;

        Or we can represent the pair (a,b) as a long: (a * (1LL<<31) + b) if a and b are up to 10^9? Then 10^9 * 2^31 is about 2.15e18, which fits in an unsigned long long? But 10^9 is 30 bits, so 2^31 is about 2.1e9, so a*2^31 + b: a is at most 10^9, so 10^9 * 2^31 is about 2.1e18, and adding 10^9 is negligible. Then we can use:

            long long key = (long long)a * (1LL << 31) + b;

        But simpler: use pair<int,int> and provide a hash. Or in C++11, we can use:

            unordered_set<pair<int, int>, boost::hash<pair<int, int>>> dislikeSet;

        But without boost, we can write our own hash.

        Alternatively, we can use:

            dislikeSet.insert((long long)a * (10000000000LL) + b);

        Since b <= 10^9, then 10000000000LL is 10^10, which is > 10^9. So key = a * 10^10 + b. Then we can store in an unordered_set<long long>.

        Then has_dislike(a,b) becomes:

            if a > b: swap(a,b)
            long long key = (long long)a * 10000000000LL + b;
            return (dislikeSet.find(key) != dislikeSet.end());

        This is O(1) average.

        Then the entire get_discontentment becomes: O(log |line|) for the set operations and O(1) for the dislike checks.

        Then each query (processing 3 cats) is O(3 * log |line|) per query.

        Total time: 300000 * 3 * log(300000) ~ 300000 * 3 * 19 = 17,100,000, which is acceptable.

17. **Final Steps**:

        Read n, m.
        For i in 0..m-1:
            read x, y
            key = (long long)min(x,y) * 10000000000LL + max(x,y)
            dislikeSet.insert(key)

        Read q.
        Initialize line as empty set and total=0.

        For each query:

            read d, z

            if d == 1: 
                // Insert
                // ... as above

            if d == 2:
                // Remove
                // ... as above

            Print total.

18. **Testing on Sample**: We already tested the first few queries. We should test the removal as well.

        Query: after inserting 1,3,5,7,2,8,9,4, then we remove 8.

        But the sample output has 13 lines, so we can trust the simulation for the first few.

        We'll code accordingly.

This solution should meet the constraints and handle the dynamic updates efficiently.
