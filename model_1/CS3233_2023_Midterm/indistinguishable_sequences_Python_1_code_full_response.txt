To solve this problem, we need to count the number of subsequences of a given permutation that have the same longest increasing subsequence (LIS) length as the entire permutation. The solution involves several key steps: computing the LIS attributes for each element, identifying critical elements, grouping these elements by their levels, and using dynamic programming to count valid subsets of these elements.

### Approach
1. **Compute LIS Attributes**: 
   - **Forward Pass (f)**: For each element, compute the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at that element. This is done using a Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree) for efficient range maximum queries.
   - **Backward Pass (g)**: For each element, compute the length of the longest increasing subsequence starting at that element. This involves reversing the array and using a similar Fenwick Tree approach.

2. **Identify Critical Elements**:
   - The LIS length of the entire permutation, `L`, is the maximum value in the `f` array.
   - An element is critical if `f[i] + g[i] - 1 = L`. These elements are essential for forming subsequences with LIS length `L`.

3. **Group Critical Elements by Levels**:
   - Critical elements are grouped by their `f[i]` values (levels). Within each level, elements are sorted in decreasing order of their values.

4. **Dynamic Programming for Valid Subsets**:
   - **State Handling**: The DP state tracks the minimum value in the last non-empty level processed. This helps ensure that elements from subsequent levels do not form an increasing sequence longer than `L-1`.
   - **Transition**: For each level, compute the number of valid subsets by considering transitions from previous states, leveraging prefix sums and modular arithmetic for efficiency.
   - **Combining Results**: The total valid subsets of critical elements (those avoiding an LIS of length `L`) are combined with the power set of non-critical elements to derive the final count.

5. **Final Count**:
   - The result is derived by subtracting the count of invalid subsequences from the total number of subsequences, using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers.

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the permutation length `n` and the permutation itself.
2. **Fenwick Trees for LIS Attributes**: 
   - **Forward Pass (`f_arr`)**: Computes the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each element using a Fenwick Tree for range maximum queries.
   - **Backward Pass (`g_arr`)**: Computes the length of the longest increasing subsequence starting at each element by reversing the array and using a similar Fenwick Tree approach.
3. **Critical Elements Identification**: Elements where `f[i] + g[i] - 1` equals the LIS length `L` of the entire permutation are marked as critical.
4. **Level Grouping**: Critical elements are grouped by their `f[i]` values (levels), and elements within each level are sorted in decreasing order.
5. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - **State Initialization**: `dp0` tracks the state with no non-empty levels, and `dp` tracks states with the minimum value in the last non-empty level.
   - **Level Processing**: For each level, compute valid transitions using prefix sums and modular inverses of powers of 2 to handle large numbers efficiently.
6. **Result Calculation**: The result is derived by subtracting the count of invalid subsequences (those avoiding an LIS of length `L`) from the total number of subsequences, adjusted for non-critical elements.
7. **Output**: The final count is printed modulo `1,000,003,233`.

This approach efficiently handles the problem constraints by leveraging dynamic programming and Fenwick Trees for optimal performance, especially given the random nature of the input permutation.
