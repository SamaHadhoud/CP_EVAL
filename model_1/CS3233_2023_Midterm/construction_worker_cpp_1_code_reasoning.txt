 Okay, I see the problem and the editorial guidelines. The solution involves:
 1. Precomputing a DP table for profits up to 5*T (since p_i is at most 5, and T up to 20000, so M=100000).
    However, note that M=5*T might be 100000, which is acceptable for T=20000? Actually, 5*20000=100000, and then we have T=20000 states. So the DP table is 100000*20000 which is 2e9 states -> too big.

 So I must correct: the editorial says M=5*T, but then the DP table would be M * T = 100000 * 20000 = 2e9, which is too large.

 Actually, the provided code in the editorial does:
   vector<vector<ll>> dp(M+1, vector<ll>(T, INF));

 That would be 100001 * 20000 ~ 2e9 * sizeof(long long) = 16e9 bytes -> 16 GB, which exceeds the memory limit.

 Therefore, we must optimize the DP dimension.

 Let me reexamine the problem: the profits per job are at most 5, and we are only going to compute up to profit M = 5*T. But T can be 20000, so M=100000. The state dimension is T (20000) and we have M+1 rows. We cannot have a 2D array of size (100001, 20000) because that's 100001*20000 = 2e9 elements, which is too many.

 Alternate approach from the editorial:

 The editorial says: "For small profits (up to 5Ã—T), use dynamic programming to compute the minimal time required to achieve each profit level starting from each residue."

 But note: the profit values per job are small (1 to 5) but the total profit we are computing up to 5*T (100000) and T is 20000, so we need 100000 states? and each state has T residues? That is 2e9 states which is too heavy.

 How can we reduce?

 Insight: we can do a state per residue and then for each residue we can store the minimal time to achieve a given profit. But we are iterating k from 0 to M (100000). The inner loop is over residues (T=20000). Then for each residue we iterate over jobs? That would be O(M * T * n) which is 100000 * 20000 * 100000 -> 2e15 operations.

 Clearly, we need a more efficient method.

 Actually, the provided code in the editorial does:

   for k from 1 to M:
      for each x in [0, T-1]:
          for each job in jobs_by_x[x]:
             if k>=p, then candidate = l + dp[k-p][r_i]   (where r_i = (x+l)%T)

      Then it builds an array A[x] = minimal candidate for each x (for this k) and then uses prefix/suffix arrays to compute:

          dp[k][r] = min{ for x: A[x] + (x - r) mod T? }

 But note: the gap from residue r to job at x is (x - r) mod T? Actually, the code does:

          candidate = l + dp[k-p][r_i]   // this is the time to do the job and then the state becomes r_i, but we are starting at residue r? 

 Actually, the state transition: 
   We are at residue r (meaning we are free starting at day = base + r, where base is a multiple of T? or we can think of the next free day modulo T is r).
   To take a job at x, we must wait until the next occurrence of x that is >= base + r. The waiting time is (x - r) mod T? Actually, the next job at x after base+r is at time: base + r + gap, where gap = (x - r + T) % T? But if x>=r then gap = x-r, else gap = x-r+T.

   Then the total time for the job is gap + l_i, and then we finish at base + r + gap + l_i, so the new residue is (r + gap + l_i) mod T = (x + l_i) mod T.

   Therefore, the recurrence is:

        dp[k][r] = min_{job i} { gap_i + l_i + dp[k - p_i][ (x_i+l_i)%T ] }

   where gap_i = (x_i - r + T) % T.

 However, the code in the editorial does:

        candidate = l + dp[k-p][r_i]   // and then sets A[x] to the minimal candidate? Then later subtracts r? 

 But note: the candidate does not include the gap? Actually, the candidate is computed as:

        candidate = l + dp[k-p][r_i]   // but we also have to add the gap (x - r) mod T? 

 In the editorial code, they do:

        candidate = l + dp[k-p][r_i]   // and then set A[x] = candidate.

 Then they build:

        B1[x] = A[x] + x
        B2[x] = A[x] + x + T

        Then for a residue r, they consider:
          candidate = min( 
               min_{x>=r} { A[x] + x } - r, 
               min_{x<r}  { A[x] + x + T } - r 
          ) 
        which is the same as min_{x} { A[x] + (x - r + T) % T? } but note: (x - r) mod T = (x - r) if x>=r, and (x - r + T) if x<r.

        Actually, the expression: 
          For x>=r: A[x] + x - r = A[x] + (x - r)
          For x<r: A[x] + x + T - r = A[x] + (x - r + T)

        So yes, it computes the total time = gap (which is (x - r) mod T) + A[x] = gap + (l + dp[k-p][r_i]).

        Therefore, the recurrence is correct.

 But the issue: we cannot iterate k from 1 to 100000 (M=100000) and for each k iterate T=20000 and then for each x iterate over the jobs at x? The worst-case for jobs at x: if one x has all 100000 jobs? Then for each k and for that x we iterate 100000 times -> total operations O(M * (T + total_jobs)) = 100000 * (20000 + 100000) = 100000 * 120000 = 12e9, which is too slow.

 Therefore, we must optimize the inner loops.

 How to optimize?

 For a fixed k, we want for each x:
   A[x] = min_{job at x and p<=k} { l + dp[k-p][r_i] }

 How to compute A[x] quickly?
   We note that for each job at x, we are considering only k>=p. And k goes from 1 to M.

   We can precompute for each residue state (which is T=20000) an array for k: dp[k][r] for k in [0, M]. But we cannot store the entire DP table because M*T=2e9.

 Alternative approach:

 We note that the profit per job is small (at most 5). So we can use a state per residue and then update the dp for k in a "knapsack" style but with residues. However, the challenge is the transition from residue to residue and the gap.

 We can try to reframe:

   Let F(r, k) = minimal total time to achieve profit k starting from residue r.

   Then: 
        F(r, k) = min_{x in [0, T-1], job i at x} { (x - r + T) % T + l_i + F( (x+l_i)%T, k - p_i) }

   But note: the gap is (x - r + T) % T.

 How to compute F(r, k) for all residues and for k increasing?

   We can iterate k from 0 to M. For each k, we want to compute an array F_k[0..T-1] from F_{k-p_i} for jobs.

   For each job i (with x_i, l_i, p_i, and r_i = (x_i+l_i)%T), we can write:

        candidate for residue r: gap = (x_i - r + T) % T = 
            if r <= x_i: x_i - r
            else: x_i - r + T

        Then: candidate(r) = gap + l_i + F_{k-p_i}[r_i]

        Then F_k[r] = min_i(candidate(r))   [over jobs i with p_i<=k]

   But note: the candidate(r) for a fixed job i is a linear function in r? Actually, it is piecewise linear.

   We can break the residue r into two segments: 
        Segment 1: r from 0 to x_i: candidate(r) = (x_i - r) + l_i + F_{k-p_i}[r_i] = (x_i + l_i + F_{k-p_i}[r_i]) - r
        Segment 2: r from x_i+1 to T-1: candidate(r) = (x_i - r + T) + l_i + F_{k-p_i}[r_i] = (x_i + T + l_i + F_{k-p_i}[r_i]) - r

   So for each job i, the candidate is a decreasing linear function in r? Actually, it's linear with slope -1.

   Then F_k[r] = min_i { constant_i - r } = (min_i constant_i) - r.

   But note: the constants are different for the two segments? Actually, for a fixed job i, the constant for segment1 is C1_i = x_i + l_i + F_{k-p_i}[r_i], and for segment2 is C2_i = x_i + T + l_i + F_{k-p_i}[r_i] = C1_i + T.

   However, we are taking min over jobs. So for each residue r, we want:

        candidate_i(r) = 
            if r <= x_i: C1_i - r
            else: C2_i - r = (C1_i+T) - r

   Then F_k[r] = min_i candidate_i(r) = (min_i { C1_i (if r<=x_i) or C1_i+T (if r>x_i) }) - r.

   Therefore, we can define an array H of size T such that for each x we consider:

        H[r] = min_i { 
            [if r<=x_i] -> C1_i,
            [if r>x_i]  -> C1_i+T 
        }

        Then F_k[r] = H[r] - r.

   How to compute H quickly?
        We can do:
          For each job i: 
            We want to set for r from 0 to x_i: candidate = min(candidate, C1_i)
            For r from x_i+1 to T-1: candidate = min(candidate, C1_i+T)

        Then H[r] is the min over i of the candidate for r.

        This is a range update: set a constant value over contiguous intervals? But note: we are taking the min. So we can do:

          We can create an array H of size T, initialize with INF.

          For each job i:
             Option1: update H[r] = min(H[r], C1_i) for r in [0, x_i]
             Option2: update H[r] = min(H[r], C1_i+T) for r in [x_i+1, T-1]

        But doing this for each job i would be O(T) per job, and total jobs n=100000, T=20000 -> 100000*20000 = 2e9, which is too slow.

        Alternatively, we can use a segment tree or a Fenwick tree? But we have 100000 jobs and 20000 residues, and we are iterating k from 1 to 100000? Then total operations 100000 * 100000 = 10e9, which is too slow.

        We need a more efficient method.

        Note: we are updating the entire array H for each job i. Instead, we can do:

          Let H1 = array for the first part: we want H1[r] = min_{i: r<=x_i} C1_i.
          Let H2 = array for the second part: H2[r] = min_{i: r>x_i} (C1_i+T).

          Then H[r] = min(H1[r], H2[r]).

        How to compute H1: 
          H1[r] = min_{i with x_i>=r} C1_i.

          This is a suffix minimum: if we sort by x_i, then we can do:

             Create an array H1 of length T, initialize with INF.
             For each job i (with x_i and C1_i), we set H1[x_i] = min(H1[x_i], C1_i).
             Then do: for r from T-2 down to 0: H1[r] = min(H1[r], H1[r+1])

          But note: we want for each residue r: the min C1_i for jobs with x_i>=r. This is the suffix min of the array where the index is the residue? Actually, we can build:

             temp[x] = min_{i with x_i=x} C1_i   (for each x from 0 to T-1)

             Then H1[r] = min_{x>=r} temp[x]

        Similarly, for H2: we want for each residue r: min_{i with x_i < r} (C1_i+T). This is the prefix minimum: 

             temp2[x] = min_{i with x_i=x} (C1_i+T)   (for each x from 0 to T-1)

             Then H2[r] = min_{x=0}^{r-1} temp2[x]   (if r>0, else INF)

        Then H[r] = min(H1[r], H2[r])

        And then F_k[r] = H[r] - r.

        Steps for a fixed k:

          Step 1: Initialize two arrays: temp1 (size T, INF) and temp2 (size T, INF).
          Step 2: For each job i (with x_i, l_i, p_i, and r_i = (x_i+l_i)%T) such that p_i<=k:
                   Let c = l_i + dp[k-p_i][r_i]   (if dp[k-p_i][r_i] is INF, skip)
                   Then:
                      temp1[x_i] = min(temp1[x_i], c)
                      temp2[x_i] = min(temp2[x_i], c)   // we don't actually need temp2 in the same way? Actually, we want for H2: (c+T) for the job i? But note: we are going to use the same c? Actually:

                   Actually, we have two different constants? We want:

                     For H1: we want the min c for x_i>=r -> so we use temp1 for the min c at each x_i? Then H1[r] = min_{x_i>=r} temp1[x_i]?
                     For H2: we want the min (c+T) for x_i<r? -> so we can define:

                         Let temp2[x_i] = min(temp2[x_i], c+T)   // but then H2[r] = min_{x_i < r} temp2[x_i]?

          Step 3: Build H1: suffix_min array for temp1: 
                   H1[r] = min(temp1[r], temp1[r+1], ..., temp1[T-1])
          Step 4: Build H2: prefix_min array for temp2: 
                   H2[0] = INF; for r from 1 to T-1: H2[r] = min(H2[r-1], temp2[r-1])? Actually, we want for residue r: min over x_i in [0, r-1] of (c_i+T). We can do:

                   Let H2[0] = INF? 
                   For r from 1 to T-1: 
                         H2[r] = min(H2[r-1], temp2[r-1])   // but note: we built temp2 for each x_i? Then for residue r, we consider x_i from 0 to r-1 -> so we want the min of temp2 for indices 0 to r-1.

          Step 5: For each residue r: 
                   H[r] = min(H1[r], H2[r])
                   Then F_k[r] = H[r] - r   (if H[r] is INF, then F_k[r]=INF)

        Then set dp[k][r] = F_k[r]? Actually, we are storing dp[k][r] = F_k[r].

        However, note: the recurrence uses dp[k-p_i] for previous profit levels. We only need the previous profit levels that are k-p_i (and p_i is small, 1 to 5). So we can keep an array for the last 5 profit levels? Actually, we only need to store dp for the current k and for k-1, k-2, ... k-5? But we are iterating k from 0 to M, so we can store dp as a circular buffer for the last 6 profit levels? Or we can store an array for each residue for the last 5? Actually, we need to store all residues for each profit level? But we only need the previous 5 profit levels. So we can use:

             dp0, dp1, dp2, dp3, dp4, dp5: each is a vector of length T for profit level k mod 6? 

        However, we are iterating k from 0 to M=100000, and we need to store the entire dp table? We cannot because of memory. But note: we only need the previous 5 levels? Actually, we need dp[k-p_i] for p_i in [1,5]. So we can store:

             dp[0..5] as vectors of length T, and then update:

                 dp[k % 6] = new vector for k.

          Then for k, we use dp[(k-p_i) % 6] for p_i in [1,5]. 

        But note: k-p_i might be negative? Then we skip. Also, we start with k=0: base case.

        How to index? We can store an array `dp_prev` for the last 6? Actually, we can store:

             dp_prev[i] for i in 0..5: each is a vector of length T for profit levels: k-5, k-4, k-3, k-2, k-1, k? 

        Actually, we iterate k from 0 to M, and we need to access dp[k - p_i] which is at most 5 behind. So we can keep:

             dp[0] = base for k=0
             then for k=1, we use dp[0] for k-1, k-2,... are not available (so skip if k-p_i<0)

        We can store:

            vector<vector<ll>> dp(6, vector<ll>(T, INF));
            // base: k0 = 0: dp[0][r] = 0 for all r.

            for k from 1 to M:
                int idx = k % 6;
                // we are going to compute dp[idx] for profit level k, and then we will overwrite the one at (k-6) mod 6? Actually, we don't need the old one beyond the last 5.

                // initialize temp1 and temp2 for the current k to INF.
                vector<ll> temp1(T, INF);
                vector<ll> temp2(T, INF);

                for each job i (with x_i, l_i, p_i, and r_i = (x_i+l_i)%T) such that p_i<=k:
                    int prev_k = k - p_i;
                    if (prev_k < 0) continue;
                    int prev_idx = prev_k % 6;
                    if (dp_prev[prev_idx][r_i] == INF) continue;
                    ll c = l_i + dp_prev[prev_idx][r_i];
                    // update temp1 and temp2 at x_i
                    if (c < temp1[x_i]) temp1[x_i] = c;
                    if (c + T < temp2[x_i]) temp2[x_i] = c + T;   // note: we are storing for H2: we want the min (c_i+T) for x_i? Actually, we want to compare c_i+T for the same job? But note: for a fixed job, we have one c and we are adding T to it. Then we take the min per x_i? So yes.

                // Now compute H1: suffix min of temp1: 
                vector<ll> H1(T, INF);
                H1[T-1] = temp1[T-1];
                for (int x = T-2; x>=0; x--) {
                    H1[x] = min(temp1[x], H1[x+1]);
                }

                // Now compute H2: prefix min of temp2, but note: for residue r, we want min_{x_i < r} (which is min_{x=0}^{r-1} temp2[x])
                vector<ll> H2(T, INF);
                if (T > 0) {
                    H2[0] = INF; // because there is no x_i < 0
                    for (int r = 1; r < T; r++) {
                        H2[r] = min(H2[r-1], temp2[r-1]); // because we want indices from 0 to r-1: so we consider temp2 at r-1 and the prefix min from 0 to r-2 is H2[r-1]
                    }
                }

                // Then for each residue r from 0 to T-1:
                for (int r = 0; r < T; r++) {
                    ll H_val = min(H1[r], H2[r]);
                    if (H_val < INF) {
                        dp_prev[idx][r] = H_val - r;
                    } else {
                        dp_prev[idx][r] = INF;
                    }
                }
            }

        But note: the memory: we have 6 * T = 6*20000 = 120000 states? and we are storing temp1, temp2, H1, H2: each T, so 4*T, which is acceptable.

        Time: for each k (100000 iterations) we do:
          - Initialize temp1 and temp2: O(T) -> 20000
          - Then iterate over all jobs: n=100000 per k -> 100000*100000 = 10e9 operations? which is too slow.

        How to fix the inner job iteration?

        Actually, we are iterating k from 1 to M (100000) and for each k, we iterate over all n=100000 jobs. That is 10e10 operations, which is 100e9, which might be borderline in C++? 100e9 operations in 4 seconds? Probably not.

        We need to optimize the job iteration.

        Idea: Precompute for each profit level? But note: we are iterating k from 1 to 100000, and for each job we check if p_i<=k? Actually, we can precompute the jobs by p_i? But then we have to consider only k>=p_i. We can do:

          For each profit value p (from 1 to 5), we have a list of jobs with that p.

          Then for a fixed k, we consider:

             for p in {1,2,3,4,5} such that p<=k:
                 for each job i in list_p:
                     prev_k = k - p
                     ... 

          Then the total work per k: 5 * (number of jobs) = 5*100000 = 500000 per k? Then 100000 * 500000 = 50e9 operations, which is too high.

        Alternate: we precompute for each residue r_i (which is in [0, T-1]) and for each profit p (1..5) the minimal value of (l_i) for jobs with residue r_i and profit p? Actually, no, because we need to update by x_i as well.

        How about: we precompute for each profit p and for each residue r_i (the state we transition to) the minimal value of (l_i + dp[prev_k][r_i])? But note: dp[prev_k][r_i] changes with k.

        Therefore, we cannot avoid iterating over jobs per k.

        However, note: the profit p_i is small (1 to 5) and fixed per job. We can store:

            jobs_by_p[1..5] = list of jobs (x_i, l_i, r_i) for that profit.

        Then for a fixed k, we iterate over p from 1 to 5 (if k>=p) and for each job in jobs_by_p[p], we do:

            prev_k = k - p
            if dp_prev[prev_k % 6][r_i] is INF, skip.
            candidate = l_i + dp_prev[prev_k % 6][r_i]

            then update temp1[x_i] = min(temp1[x_i], candidate)
            update temp2[x_i] = min(temp2[x_i], candidate+T)   // actually, we don't need to update temp2 separately? Because we are going to use the same candidate for both? Actually, we update both temp1 and temp2 at x_i.

        Then the inner loop per k: 5 * (number of jobs) = 500000 per k -> total 100000 * 500000 = 50e9, which is 50 billion iterations. In C++ this might run in about 10 seconds? But worst-case 20 seconds? The time limit is 4 seconds.

        We need to optimize further.

        Alternate: Instead of iterating over all jobs for each k, we precompute for each residue r_i and each profit p the minimal value of (l_i + dp[k-p][r_i]) over k? Not possible.

        How about: we maintain for each residue r_i and each profit p the minimal candidate for the current k? No, because dp[k-p][r_i] changes with k.

        Another idea: we can update temp1 and temp2 using the jobs only once per k, but we note that we are doing:

            candidate = l_i + dp_prev[prev_k % 6][r_i]

        and we update temp1[x_i] = min(temp1[x_i], candidate) and similarly for temp2.

        But we can precompute for each x_i the minimal candidate over jobs with that x_i? Actually, we are iterating by p and then by job, so we can update temp1 and temp2 for each job independently.

        We can avoid the inner loop over jobs by precomputing per x? Actually, we are updating temp1 and temp2 at x_i for each job. We can do:

            for each p from 1 to 5:
                for each residue r in [0, T-1]:
                    // Consider all jobs with profit p and resulting residue r: we want to update temp1[x] for x = the job's x_i with candidate = l_i + dp[k-p][r] 
                    // But note: we don't know the x_i? We have to iterate over jobs? 

        Actually, we have to iterate over jobs. There is no avoiding it.

        But note: the total number of jobs is 100000, and we iterate for each k from 1 to M (100000) and for each p in 1..5 (if k>=p) -> worst-case k>=p always for k>=5. So for k from 1 to 4: we do 1,2,3,4 p's. Then for k>=5: 5 p's.

        Total operations: 
            k=1: p=1 -> n
            k=2: p=1,2 -> 2n
            k=3: p=1,2,3 -> 3n
            k=4: p=1,2,3,4 -> 4n
            k=5 to k=M: 5n each.

            Total = n*(1+2+3+4) + 5n*(M-4) = 10n + 5n*(M-4) = 5n*M - 10n = 5*100000*100000 - 10*100000 = 50e9 - 1e6 = 50e9.

        50e9 operations is too high.

        We need a different approach.

        How about we reframe: we want for each x_i, the minimal candidate = l_i + dp[k-p_i][r_i] for any job at x_i.

        We can precompute:

            For each x in [0, T-1], we store the list of jobs (l_i, p_i, r_i) at x.

        Then for a fixed k, we can iterate x from 0 to T-1? and for each job at x, if k>=p_i, we compute candidate = l_i + dp_prev[(k-p_i)%6][r_i] and then update temp1[x] and temp2[x] for that x.

        Then the inner loop is: for each x (T=20000), and for each job at x (say count_x), then total operations per k: sum_{x} count_x = n = 100000.

        So per k: 100000 operations.

        Then total for k from 1 to M: 100000 * 100000 = 10e9 operations? 10 billion, which is acceptable in C++ in 4 seconds? Actually, 10e9 operations might be 10 seconds in C++. We need to optimize.

        But note: M=100000, and T=20000, and n=100000 -> 100000*100000=10e9 iterations. In C++, each iteration is a few operations (array access, min, modulus). We can try to optimize by:

            Precomputation: we have an array `dp_prev` of size 6*T, and we have to index it by (k-p_i) mod 6 and r_i.

        Steps for fixed k:

            vector<ll> temp1(T, INF);
            vector<ll> temp2(T, INF);

            for (int x = 0; x < T; x++) {
                for (auto [l, p, r_i] : jobs_by_x[x]) {
                    if (p > k) continue;
                    int prev_k = k - p;
                    int idx_prev = prev_k % 6;
                    if (dp_prev[idx_prev][r_i] == INF) continue;
                    ll candidate = l + dp_prev[idx_prev][r_i];
                    if (candidate < temp1[x]) 
                        temp1[x] = candidate;
                    if (candidate + T < temp2[x])
                        temp2[x] = candidate + T;
                }
            }

            // Then compute H1 and H2 as described.

        Then the total number of iterations: for k from 1 to M: for each job: 100000 * 100000 = 10e9 per k? Actually, for each k we iterate over all n=100000 jobs. So total 100000 * 100000 = 10e9 * 100000? No, wait: k goes from 1 to M (100000), and for each k we iterate over all jobs (100000). So total operations: 100000 * 100000 = 10e9.

        10e9 operations is 10 billion. In C++, a tight loop of 10e9 operations might run in 10 seconds? But we have 4 seconds.

        We must optimize further.

        How about: we precompute the jobs_by_x, and then the inner loop is over x and then the jobs at x. The total number of jobs is n=100000, so the inner loop over jobs is 100000 per k? Then total operations: 100000 * 100000 = 10e9.

        We can try to break early: if we have many jobs at the same x, we can precompute for each x and for each profit p the minimal l_i? But note: we have:

            candidate = l_i + dp_prev[ (k-p) % 6 ][r_i]

        The term dp_prev[ (k-p) % 6 ][r_i] depends on k and r_i. So we cannot precompute.

        Alternate: we note that the profit p_i is small (only 5 distinct values). So we can group jobs at x by p_i. But even then, for each x we have at most 5 groups? Actually, we can have multiple jobs at x with the same p_i? Then we want the minimal candidate for a fixed (x, p_i) = minimal (l_i + dp_prev[ (k-p_i)%6 ][r_i]) over jobs at x with profit p_i.

        How to compute that quickly? We can store for each x and each p (1..5) the minimal candidate among jobs at x with profit p. But note: we cannot because the dp_prev term depends on r_i, and r_i = (x+l_i)%T, which is different per job.

        Therefore, we must iterate over all jobs.

        Given the constraints (10e9 operations) and that 10e9 is borderline in C++ (about 10 seconds on a fast machine), we must hope that the constant factors are low? Or we need to optimize differently.

        Alternatively, we can avoid iterating over all jobs for every k by noticing that for a fixed job, we only care about k>=p_i and then we update only when k>=p_i. But we still iterate over k from p_i to M? That doesn't reduce.

        We need a more efficient method.

        Insight: the recurrence for F_k[r] = min_{x} { (x - r + T) % T + min_{job at x} { l_i + F_{k-p_i}[r_i] } }.

        Actually, we can separate the minimization over x and then over jobs at x. And we are already doing: for each x, we compute the minimal candidate over jobs at x: that is temp1[x] = min_{job at x} { l_i + F_{k-p_i}[r_i] }.

        Then the recurrence becomes:

             F_k[r] = min_{x} { (x - r + T) % T + temp1[x] }.

        And we can compute this for all r quickly using the technique with prefix/suffix minima? 

        But note: in the previous approach we did:

             temp1[x] = min_{job i at x} { l_i + F_{k-p_i}[r_i] }

        Then we built H1 and H2 from temp1, and then F_k[r] = min( H1[r], H2[r] ) - r.

        So the entire algorithm per k is:

          Step 1: For each x in [0, T-1]:
                   temp1[x] = min_{job i at x} { l_i + F_{k-p_i}[r_i] }   [if there is no job, temp1[x]=INF]

          Step 2: Build H1: suffix min of temp1: H1[r] = min_{x>=r} temp1[x]
          Step 3: Build H2: prefix min of (temp1[x] + T) for x<r? Actually, we want for residue r: 
                   candidate = 
                       if x>=r: temp1[x] + (x - r)   [which is (temp1[x] + x) - r]
                       if x<r: (temp1[x] + T) + (x - r) = (temp1[x] + x + T) - r
                   So we can precompute:
                       B1[x] = temp1[x] + x
                       B2[x] = temp1[x] + x + T

                   Then we want for residue r:
                       candidate = min( 
                           min_{x>=r} B1[x] - r, 
                           min_{x<r} B2[x] - r 
                       ) 
                   = min( 
                         (min_{x>=r} B1[x]) - r, 
                         (min_{x<r} B2[x]) - r 
                   )

          And we can compute:
                min_{x>=r} B1[x] by a suffix array on B1?
                min_{x<r} B2[x] by a prefix array on B2? Actually, note: for x<r, we want the min of B2 for x in [0, r-1]. So we can do a prefix min for B2? But note: B2 is defined for each x, but we want for x<r -> indices 0 to r-1.

          However, we are building H1 and H2 from temp1, not from B1 and B2? Actually, we can do:

                vector<ll> B1 = temp1;
                for x in [0, T-1]: 
                    B1[x] = temp1[x] + x;   // but if temp1[x] is INF, then B1[x] should remain INF? Yes.

                Then build suffix_min_B1: 
                    suff_min[r] = min_{x>=r} B1[x]

                Similarly, vector<ll> B2 = temp1;
                for x in [0, T-1]:
                    B2[x] = temp1[x] + x + T;
                Then build prefix_min_B2: 
                    pref_min[0] = INF;
                    for r from 1 to T: 
                        pref_min[r] = min(pref_min[r-1], B2[r-1]);

          Then for residue r:
                F_k[r] = min(suff_min[r], pref_min[r]) - r;

          But note: we don't need to store H1 and H2 separately? We can compute F_k[r] directly.

        How to compute temp1[x] quickly? We want:

             temp1[x] = min_{job i at x} { l_i + F_{k-p_i}[r_i] }

          And F_{k-p_i}[r_i] is stored in dp_prev[(k-p_i) % 6][r_i].

          So to compute temp1[x], we must iterate over the jobs at x? And the total jobs is n=100000, so the total work for all x is n? Then per k: O(n) = 100000.

        Therefore, the entire per k is:

            O(n) to compute temp1 for all x (by iterating over jobs) 
            plus O(T) to build B1, B2, and the suffix and prefix arrays.

        Total per k: 100000 + 20000 = 120000.

        Then for k from 1 to M=100000: 100000 * 120000 = 12e9 operations? 12 billion, which is 12 seconds? Still borderline.

        But note: M=100000 -> 100000 * (100000 + 20000) = 12e9 operations.

        We must hope that we can optimize the inner job loop? 

        Actually, we iterate over jobs: for each job, we do:

             if (k < p_i) skip.
             else: 
                 prev_k = k - p_i;
                 idx_prev = prev_k % 6;
                 candidate = l_i + dp_prev[idx_prev][r_i];   // if dp_prev is INF, skip.

                 then update temp1[x_i] = min(temp1[x_i], candidate)

        We do this for each job and each k? Actually, no: we are iterating k from 1 to M, and for each job we do this check for every k? But we are not. We are iterating k independently.

        How to compute temp1 for a fixed k quickly? 

          We cannot avoid iterating over jobs at x for each x? But note: the number of jobs at x is the total n. So we must do at least n per k.

        Total work: M * n = 100000 * 100000 = 10e9, which is 10 billion, and then plus O(T) per k -> 100000*20000=2e9, total 12e9.

        In C++, we can hope to run 12e9 operations in 4 seconds? Probably not.

        We need to reduce the constant factor.

        Alternate approach: 

          We note that the profit p_i is small (1 to 5). So for a fixed job i, we only need to consider k = p_i, p_i+1, ..., M. We can update the temp1 for that job only for these k. But then we would be iterating over k for each job? That is also 100000*(M) = 10e9.

        How about we swap the loops: for each job i, and for each k>=p_i, update:

             candidate = l_i + dp_prev[(k-p_i)%6][r_i]

             then update temp1[x_i] for the specific k.

        But then we would have to store for each k a list of updates? Then we still have to do 10e9 updates.

        Given the complexity, we may need to use a different strategy for the entire problem.

        However, we note that the sample input has T=10, n=2, and q=7. Our M=5*T=50.

        But in worst-case T=20000, then M=100000, and n=100000, and 100000*100000=10e9, which is too slow.

        We need a more efficient method for the DP.

        Insight from known similar problems: "accelerating" the DP for small steps by using a deque or by matrix exponentiation? But the state is residue mod T, and the transitions are linear.

        We can use matrix exponentiation over the residue ring? But the state is T-dimensional and T=20000, which is too big for matrix exponentiation.

        Another idea: use Dijkstra-like relaxation? We start from profit 0 and then relax to higher profits. But we want the minimal time for (profit, residue), and we can relax by jobs. However, the profit is not the state we relax? We are iterating profit from 0 to M.

        Given the time constraints, we might have to use the 12e9 method and hope that the constant factors are low or that the worst-case is not reached.

        Or try to optimize the inner loops:

          - We can use a flat array for jobs_by_x: store for each x a vector of jobs. The total size is n.
          - Then for each k, we do:

                vector<ll> temp1(T, INF);
                for (int x = 0; x < T; x++) {
                    for (const auto& job : jobs_by_x[x]) {
                         ll l = get<0>(job);
                         int p = get<1>(job);
                         int r_i = get<2>(job);
                         if (k < p) continue;
                         int prev_k = k - p;
                         int idx_prev = prev_k % 6;
                         if (dp_prev[idx_prev][r_i] == INF) continue;
                         ll candidate = l + dp_prev[idx_prev][r_i];
                         if (candidate < temp1[x]) 
                             temp1[x] = candidate;
                    }
                }

          - Then build B1: for x in [0, T-1]: B1[x] = temp1[x] + x;
          - Build suffix_min_B1: 
                vector<ll> suff_min_B1(T, INF);
                suff_min_B1[T-1] = B1[T-1];
                for (int i = T-2; i>=0; i--) 
                    suff_min_B1[i] = min(B1[i], suff_min_B1[i+1]);

          - Build B2: for x in [0, T-1]: 
                B2[x] = (temp1[x] < INF) ? temp1[x] + x + T : INF;
          - Build pref_min_B2: 
                vector<ll> pref_min_B2(T, INF);
                if (T>0) {
                    pref_min_B2[0] = INF; // for r=0, there is no x<0.
                    for (int i = 1; i < T; i++) {
                        pref_min_B2[i] = min(pref_min_B2[i-1], B2[i-1]);
                    }
                }

          - Then for r in [0, T-1]:
                ll choice1 = suff_min_B1[r];
                ll choice2 = pref_min_B2[r];
                ll total = min(choice1, choice2);
                if (total < INF) 
                    dp_prev[k%6][r] = total - r;
                else
                    dp_prev[k%6][r] = INF;

          - And note: we are only storing the last 6 profit levels.

        The operations per k: 
            - Initializing temp1: T assignments (20000)
            - The job loop: n iterations (100000)
            - Building B1, B2: T iterations (20000)
            - Building suffix_min_B1 and pref_min_B2: O(T) each.
            - Updating dp_prev: T iterations.

            Total: 100000 + 5 * 20000 = 200000 per k.

        Total for M=100000: 100000 * 200000 = 20e9 = 20 billion operations.

        This is too high.

        We must optimize the job loop. Notice that the inner job loop is: 

            for each job in jobs_by_x[x]: // the total over x is n

        But if we could for each job i, quickly determine if it updates temp1[x_i] for a fixed k, and do it without iterating over every job for every k, then we might improve.

        How about we only consider jobs that might update temp1[x_i] for any k? But the candidate depends on k.

        Given the time constraints, we might have to accept that M=100000 might be too high.

        But note: the problem says p_i is between 1 and 5, and we are only going to M=5*T. If T=20000, then M=100000.

        However, we note that the sample input has T=10, n=2, and M=50.

        We must find a solution that is O(M * T) or O(M * something else) with a small constant.

        Insight: we can use a multi-layer Dijkstra. We consider states (residue, profit) and we want the minimal time to achieve profit in a state. We start from (0,0) with time=0.

        The edge from (r, k) to (r', k+p_i) has weight = gap + l_i, where gap = (x_i - r + T) % T, and r' = (x_i + l_i) % T.

        Then we do a Dijkstra over state (r, k) for k up to M=100000 and r in [0, T-1] -> 100000 * 20000 = 2e9 states, which is too many.

        Given the complexity of the problem, we might have to live with the 20 billion and hope that it passes in C++ with fast I/O and optimizations.

        But 20 billion iterations in C++: each iteration is a few operations. Assume 10 cycles per iteration, then 20e9 * 10 = 200e9 cycles. A modern GHz processor does 1e9 cycles per second, so 200 seconds.

        We need a better approach.

        Let me try to formalize the recurrence as a convolution in the residue space. The recurrence is:

          F_{k}[r] = min_{x} { (x - r + T) % T + G_{k}[x] }

          where G_{k}[x] = min_{job i at x} { l_i + F_{k-p_i}[r_i] } 

        And note: the min over x is a min-convolution with a kernel that is -r plus a function of x.

        We can compute F_{k} from G_{k} by:

          F_{k}[r] = min_{x} { kernel(x, r) + G_{k}[x] }

          where kernel(x, r) = (x - r) if x>=r, and (x - r + T) if x<r.

        And this kernel is a linear function in x and r: kernel(x, r) = x - r + T * [x<r]

        This is a piecewise linear function. 

        We can compute this by:

          Let A[x] = G_{k}[x] + x.
          Let B[x] = G_{k}[x] + x + T.

          Then F_{k}[r] = min( 
                  min_{x>=r} A[x] - r, 
                  min_{x<r}  B[x] - r 
              ) 

        = min( 
              (min_{x>=r} A[x]) - r, 
              (min_{x<r} B[x]) - r 
          )

        This can be computed in O(T) time for all r if we have A and B, by doing a suffix min on A and a prefix min on B.

        Now, how to compute G_{k}[x]? 

          G_{k}[x] = min_{job i at x} { l_i + F_{k-p_i}[ (x+l_i) % T] } 

        This is not a convolution, but it is a local update at x.

        The challenge is the term F_{k-p_i}[ (x+l_i) % T]. 

        The plan for a fixed k is:

          1. For each x, we want to compute G_k[x] = min_{job i at x} { l_i + F_{k-p_i}[ (x+l_i) % T] } 
          2. Then from G_k, we compute F_k using the above method.

        We iterate k from 0 to M.

        Step 1: For each x, and for each job i at x with profit p_i, we need F_{k-p_i}[ r_i ] for r_i = (x+l_i)%T.

        How to get F_{k-p_i}? We store F for the last 5 profit levels (because p_i<=5) in a circular buffer.

        The state for a fixed profit level is a vector of length T.

        Memory: 5 * T * sizeof(long long) = 5 * 20000 * 8 = 800000 bytes.

        For each k, we then do:

           // For each x, initialize G_k[x] = INF.
           for x in 0..T-1:
               for each job i in jobs_by_x[x]:
                   p = p_i
                   if k < p: continue
                   r_i = (x + l_i) % T
                   candidate = l_i + F_prev[ (k-p) % 5 ][ r_i ]   // F_prev[level][r] for level = (k-p) mod 5 (but we store only the last 5)
                   G_k[x] = min(G_k[x], candidate)

           // Then compute F_k for all r from 0 to T-1 using the method above: 
             A[x] = (G_k[x] < INF) ? (G_k[x] + x) : INF;
             B[x] = (G_k[x] < INF) ? (G_k[x] + x + T) : INF;

             // build suffix min for A: 
                suffix_min[x] = min_{i>=x} A[i]
             // build prefix min for B: 
                prefix_min[x] = min_{i<x} B[i]   // for x>0, and INF for x=0.

             for r in 0..T-1:
                 option1 = suffix_min[r] - r;
                 option2 = (r==0 ? INF : prefix_min[r] - r);   // but wait, prefix_min[r] is the min of B[0] to B[r-1], and then we subtract r?
                 F_k[r] = min(option1, option2)

        Then store F_k in the circular buffer for future use.

        The complexity per k: 
            - Iterate over x and jobs: the total number of jobs is n=100000, so O(n)
            - Plus O(T) for building A, B, suffix_min, prefix_min, and then iterating r.

        Total per k: O(n + T) = 100000 + 20000 = 120000.

        Total for k=1 to M=100000: 100000 * 120000 = 12e9.

        This is 12 billion operations, which in C++ may run in a minute or so.

        But we must optimize the constant factor.

        Let's code and hope that we can optimize further or that the constant factor is low enough? 
        The constraints say T up to 20000, n up to 100000, and M=100000, then 12e9 is borderline in C++ (about 12 seconds on a fast machine).

        However, the problem time limit is 4 seconds.

        We must reduce.

        Notice: in the job loop, we are doing for each job in jobs_by_x[x], and the total number of jobs is n, so it is O(n) per k.

        But note: most jobs will be skipped for small k (k < p_i) only at the beginning. For k>=5, we do it for all jobs.

        How to avoid iterating over all jobs for every k? 

          The candidate for a job i at x is only defined for k>=p_i. And it is: 
             candidate = l_i + F_{k-p_i}[ (x+l_i)%T ]

          But F_{k-p_i} changes with k.

        We cannot precompute. 

        Given the complexity, we might have to live with 12e9 and hope that the judge is fast or we can use faster arrays.

        Alternatively, we note that the only values that change in the circular buffer for F are for the current k, and the job might be reused. There's no obvious speedup.

        But wait: the profit p_i is small, and for a fixed job i, the only times we use it is for k = p_i, p_i+1, ..., M.

        So if we could iterate over k for a fixed job in an offline manner, we might do:

          for each job i:
             for k = p_i to M:
                 if candidate = l_i + F_{k-p_i}[r_i] is better than the current G_k[x_i], then update.

        Then the total work is n * (M - p_i + 1) = 100000 * 100000 = 10e9, and then we still have to do the O(T) stuff for each k, total 100000 * 20000 = 2e9, overall 12e9.

        So it is the same.

        Therefore, we must implement the 12e9 solution and hope for the best.

        However, note: the sample input has M=50, which is 50 * (2 + 10) = 50 * 12 = 600, which is fine.

        For the worst-case, 12e9 might run in about a minute in C++. 

        We need to optimize the inner loop in C++ to be as fast as possible.

        Implementation details:

          - Use vectors of fixed size.
          - Use a vector of vectors for jobs_by_x: jobs_by_x[i] is a vector of (l_i, p_i, r_i) for x=i.
          - Use a circular buffer for F: we only need the last 5 levels. Let's say we have:

                vector<vector<ll>> F_prev(6, vector<ll>(T, INF));
                // F_prev[0] corresponds to k=0, then k=1 at index 1, etc., but we use modulo 6? Actually, we only need the last 5, but we also need to store for 0,1,...,5 and then reuse.

            We'll have an array F for the current k, and then after computing it, we store it in a buffer: 

                F_prev[k % 6] = F;   // but we are iterating k, and we need to access k-p_i, which is at least k-5, so we need to keep the last 5+1=6 levels.

          - For k=0, we initialize F0[r] = 0 for r=0? Actually, the state at profit 0: we are at day 0, so residue=0. But what about other residues? The editorial's base case: "for each residue r: dp[0][r]=0" -> wait, the sample code does:

                for (int r = 0; r < T; r++) {
                    dp[0][r] = 0;
                }

            This means we can start at any residue? But initially, we are at day 0, and residue 0 (since we are free at day 0). 

            However, the recurrence might allow starting at any residue? How could we be at residue r>0 at profit 0? It takes time to advance to the next job offer at residue r? 

            Actually, at profit 0, we have done nothing, so we are at day 0, and the next free day is day 0, so residue=0.

            Therefore, we should have:

                F0[0] = 0, and F0[r] for r>0 = INF.

            But the sample code initialized all to 0.

            Why? The recurrence for k=0: then for a job we would do: candidate = l_i + F0[r_i] = l_i, which is not necessarily 0. And then for a residue r, we compute:

                F1[r] = min_{x} { (x - r) % T + min_{job i at x} candidate } 

            If we start at residue r (at profit 0) with F0[r]=0, then for a job at x, the gap is (x - r + T) % T, and then the candidate for the job is gap + l_i, and then F1[r] = min_{x} { gap + (min_{i} l_i) }.

            But we are at residue 0 initially, not r. 

            Therefore, the state at profit 0 should only be defined for r=0.

            So change: 
                F0[0] = 0, and for r>0, F0[r] = INF.

        Steps for k=0:

            vector<ll> F0(T, INF);
            F0[0] = 0;
            F_prev[0] = F0;   // for k=0, index0=0.

        Then for k=1 to M:

            vector<ll> G(T, INF);   // for each x, G[x]

            // For each x in [0, T-1]:
            for (int x = 0; x < T; x++) {
                for (auto job : jobs_by_x[x]) {
                    ll l = get<0>(job);
                    int p = get<1>(job);
                    int r_i = get<2>(job); // (x+l) % T, precomputed when adding the job.
                    if (k < p) continue;
                    int prev_index = (k - p) % 6;
                    if (F_prev[prev_index][r_i] == INF) continue;
                    ll candidate = l + F_prev[prev_index][r_i];
                    if (candidate < G[x]) {
                        G[x] = candidate;
                    }
                }
            }

            // Build arrays A and B:
            vector<ll> A(T, INF);
            vector<ll> B_vec(T, INF);
            for (int x = 0; x < T; x++) {
                if (G[x] < INF) {
                    A[x] = G[x] + x;
                    B_vec[x] = G[x] + x + T;
                }
            }

            // Suffix min for A: suff_min[i] = min_{j>=i} A[j]
            vector<ll> suff_min(T, INF);
            suff_min[T-1] = A[T-1];
            for (int i = T-2; i >=0; i--) {
                suff_min[i] = min(A[i], suff_min[i+1]);
            }

            // Prefix min for B: pref_min[i] = min_{j=0}^{i-1} B_vec[j]
            vector<ll> pref_min(T, INF);
            if (T > 0) {
                // for i=0, pref_min[0]=INF (no x<0)
                pref_min[0] = INF;
                for (int i = 1; i < T; i++) {
                    pref_min[i] = min(pref_min[i-1], B_vec[i-1]);
                }
            }

            // Now, compute F_k for each residue r:
            vector<ll> F_current(T, INF);
            for (int r = 0; r < T; r++) {
                ll option1 = INF, option2 = INF;
                if (suff_min[r] < INF) {
                    option1 = suff_min[r] - r;
                }
                if (pref_min[r] < INF) {
                    option2 = pref_min[r] - r;
                }
                F_current[r] = min(option1, option2);
            }

            // Store in circular buffer:
            F_prev[k % 6] = F_current;

        Finally, we do the cycle part and answer queries.

        But note: the memory of F_prev is 6 * T = 120000 integers, which is fine.

        The total operations: M * (n + 5*T) = 100000 * (100000 + 100000) = 100000 * 200000 = 20e9.

        Wait, we have for each k: 
            - a loop over x in [0, T-1] and within that over the jobs at x: total work = total number of jobs = n = 100000.
            - then building A and B: T=20000
            - then building suffix_min and prefix_min: T each.
            - then building F_current: T.

            total per k: n + 5 * T = 100000 + 100000 = 200000.

            total for M=100000: 100000 * 200000 = 20e9.

        20e9 is 20 billion. In C++, we hope that it runs in 20 seconds? 

        We must optimize further.

        Notice: in the job loop, we are doing for each x from 0 to T-1, and then for each job in jobs_by_x[x]. The total work for the job loop is the sum_{x} (number of jobs at x) = n. So that is 100000 per k.

        The rest is 4 * T = 80000 per k.

        So indeed 100000 + 80000 = 180000 per k, times 100000 gives 18e9.

        We must reduce the job loop overhead.

        How about we iterate over all jobs once for each k, without iterating over x explicitly for the jobs? 

          vector<ll> G(T, INF);
          for (int x = 0; x < T; x++) {
              // then iterate over jobs at x: this is cache friendly? 
          }

        Alternatively, we can do:

          for (int x = 0; x < T; x++) {
              if (jobs_by_x[x].empty()) continue;
              for (auto job : jobs_by_x[x]) {
                  ...
              }
          }

        This is the same.

        How about we create a vector of all jobs? And then for each job, we know x. Then we can do:

          vector<ll> G(T, INF);
          for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
              int x = jobs[i].x;
              // if k>= jobs[i].p, then update G[x]
          }

        This is also O(n) per k, but might be faster? Because we avoid nested vectors and cache misses.

        Let's try: 
          Pre-store all jobs in a vector `jobs` of size n, with (x, l, p, r_i).
          Then for each k, we do:

             for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                 if (k < jobs[i].p) continue;
                 int x = jobs[i].x;
                 ll candidate = jobs[i].l + F_prev[(k - jobs[i].p) % 6][ jobs[i].r_i ];
                 if (candidate < G[x]) 
                     G[x] = candidate;
             }

        This is O(n) per k, and might be cache-friendly because we are iterating linearly over a vector.

        But note: the access to F_prev is random: it depends on jobs[i].r_i. Might be cache-unfriendly.

        We can try to interchange the loops: but there's no obvious way.

        Given the time, we output this solution and hope that it runs within 4 seconds for the worst-case on the judge, or that the judge is fast.

        But 20 billion iterations might be too slow.

        We must also do the cycle detection and then answer the queries.

        Cycle detection: 
            For each residue r, we want to find the best cycle: a sequence of jobs that starts and ends at residue r and yields profit P and takes time D, such that P/D is maximized.

            We can do: 
                best_cycle_profit[r] = 0;
                best_cycle_time[r] = INF;

                for (int k1 = 0; k1 <= M; k1++) {
                    if (F_full[k1][r] == INF) continue;
                    for (int k2 = k1+1; k2 <= min(M, k1+50); k2++) {
                         if (F_full[k2][r] < INF) {
                             time_diff = F_full[k2][r] - F_full[k1][r]
                             profit_diff = k2 - k1;
                             // then compare ratios...
                         }
                    }
                }

            But we only have the last 6 levels of F, not the full table.

        How to store the full table? The full table has M * T = 100000 * 20000 = 2e9 states, which is 16 GB.

        So we cannot store.

        Therefore, we must do the cycle detection as we compute the last profit level? 

        But the sample code in the editorial does:

            for (int r=0; r<T; r++) {
                for (int k1=0; k1<=M; k1++) {
                    if (dp[k1][r]==INF) continue;
                    for (int k2=k1+1; k2<=min(M, k1+50); k2++) {
                        if (dp[k2][r] < INF) {
                            // then consider the cycle from k1 to k2 at residue r.
                        }
                    }
                }
            }

        They only consider k2 within k1+50. Why? Because the profit per job is bounded by 5, and we are looking for the best cycle, and it might be that a cycle with small length is better. By only checking the next 50 profit levels, we might find the best cycle. 

        How to do it without storing the entire dp table? 

          We store the entire dp table for the last profit levels? We have M=100000 and T=20000 -> 2e9 states, not possible.

        Alternatively, we can store for each residue r and for each profit level k, the minimal time in an array of size T for each residue? But we have only stored the last 6.

        We must change: during the dp for k=0 to M, we store for each residue r the best time for that (k, r) in a separate table: `dp_table[r][k]` is not possible because we don't have memory.

        Therefore, we do the cycle detection after the dp for each residue r only for the states we have in the circular buffer? No.

        Given the complexity, we might do the cycle detection during the dp for each residue r by storing an array of the minimal times for each profit at each residue? 

          But we are only storing the last 6. 

        Instead, we can store for each residue r a vector of (profit, time) for all k that we computed? The total number of states is M * T = 2e9, which is too much.

        Therefore, we must do the cycle detection offline after we have computed the entire dp table for all k and r, but we cannot.

        The editorial's cycle detection only considers k1 and k2 within a window of 50. So we can store for each residue r, the list of (k, time) for k in the range [0, M]? The size for each residue is M=100000, and T=20000 -> 100000 * 20000 = 2e9 states.

        Alternatively, we can during the dp for each k, for each residue r, and for each residue r, maintain a list of the last 50 states (k, time)? 

        But the cycle might not be found in the last 50, but in any two states within 50 profit units.

        We can for each residue r, maintain an array `min_time` for the last 50 profit levels that we have seen? But we want to consider any two states (k1, k2) with k2-k1<=50.

        We can do for each residue r:

            // Store a deque or a circular buffer of the last 50 dp values for this residue.
            // But also we want to consider all profit levels in the past that are within 50 of the current.

        Given the complexity, and since 50 is a constant, we can for each residue r and for each k, look back at the states for r at profit levels from max(0, k-50) to k-1.

        So after computing F_k[r] (for the current k), we can for each residue r:

            for int k1 = max(0, k-50); k1 < k; k1++) {
                if (dp_table[r][k1] is not INF and F_k[r] is not INF) {
                    time_diff = F_k[r] - dp_table[r][k1];
                    profit_diff = k - k1;
                    // update best_cycle for r: best_cycle_profit[r] / best_cycle_time[r] < profit_diff / time_diff, or by cross multiplication.
                }
            }

        But then we have to store for each residue r and for the last 50 profit levels the value of the dp.

        Memory: 50 * T = 50 * 20000 = 1e6, which is fine.

        However, we are iterating for each residue r and for each k, 50 * T = 50 * 20000 = 1e6 per k, and then for M=100000 -> 100000 * 1e6 = 10e9, which is 10 billion.

        This is too heavy.

        Alternatively, we can do the cycle detection at the end of the dp for each residue r separately, and only for the states we have stored. But we only have the states for profit levels that are k mod 6, not the entire range.

        Therefore, we must store for each residue r and for every profit level k the minimal time? 

        We cannot.

        Given the time constraints, we output the solution without cycle detection in the intended way and hope that M=100000 is not too slow.

        Or we might precompute the best cycle from the dp we have for k in [0, M] and residue r, but without storing the entire table. 

        The intended solution in the editorial does store the entire dp table? The sample code does, and then iterates for k1 and k2 up to M, but only for a window of 50 in k2.

        So in the sample code, the cycle detection is O(T * M * 50) = 20000 * 100000 * 50 = 100e9, which is not possible.

        The sample code in the editorial has:

            for (int r=0; r<T; r++) {
                for (int k1=0; k1<=M; k1++) {
                    for (int k2=k1+1; k2<=min(M, k1+50); k2++) {
                         // 
                    }
                }
            }

        This is O(M * 50 * T) = 100000 * 50 * 20000 = 100e9, which is 100 billion, not feasible.

        Therefore, the intended editorial might have a different complexity for cycle detection. 

        The better approach: for each residue r, we can store an array `last` of size (max_profit+1) but we have to see. 
        Given the time, we will output the solution for the dp and then answer the queries as in the sample code: 

          best_profit = 0
          for k = 0 to min(M, some bound) such that dp_table[0][k] <= z_j:
              // then use the best cycle for residue 0 to add more profit.

        But without cycle detection for each residue, we only have the best cycle for residue 0? 

        The sample code uses residue 0 for the query because SoCCat starts at day 0, so residue 0.

        In fact, the query: 
            best_profit = 0
            for k=0 to M:
                if dp[k][0] <= z:
                    time_left = z - dp[k][0]
                    if best_cycle_time[0] != INF:
                        cycle_profit = (time_left / best_cycle_time[0]) * best_cycle_profit[0]
                    best_profit = max(best_profit, k + cycle_profit)

        So we only need the best cycle for residue 0.

        How to compute the best cycle for residue 0 without the entire dp table? 

          We have during the dp for each k, the value dp_table[0][k] = F_k[0].

          We can store for residue 0: a vector `times` of the minimal time for each profit level k.

          Memory: M+1 = 100001, which is acceptable.

        Therefore, after we finish the dp for k=0..M, we have a vector `F_0` of size M+1 for residue 0.

        Then for residue 0, we do:

            best_cycle_profit = 0
            best_cycle_time = INF

            for (int k1=0; k1<=M; k1++) {
                if (F_0[k1] > some large value) continue;
                for (int k2 = k1+1; k2<=min(M, k1+50); k2++) {
                    if (F_0[k2] < INF) {
                        ll time_diff = F_0[k2] - F_0[k1];
                        ll profit_diff = k2 - k1;
                        if (time_diff <= 0) continue;
                        // update best cycle: if profit_diff / time_diff > best_cycle_profit / best_cycle_time, or if equal and time_diff is smaller? 
                        // Actually, we want to maximize the additional profit per unit time.
                        // And then for a given time_left, the total profit is k1 + (time_left // time_diff) * profit_diff.
                        // But we care about the cycle: we can use the cycle (profit_diff, time_diff) repeatedly.
                        // Compare: 
                        //   (best_cycle_profit * time_diff < profit_diff * best_cycle_time) 
                        //   or if equal, we want the time_diff to be not necessarily smaller? 
                        // Actually, if we have two cycles with the same ratio, then either is fine.
                        // But the sample code also updates if the ratio is the same and the time_diff is smaller.
                        if (best_cycle_profit * time_diff < profit_diff * best_cycle_time) {
                            best_cycle_profit = profit_diff;
                            best_cycle_time = time_diff;
                        } else if (best_cycle_profit * time_diff == profit_diff * best_cycle_time) {
                            if (time_diff < best_cycle_time) {
                                best_cycle_time = time_diff;
                                best_cycle_profit = profit_diff;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }

        This is O(M * 50) = 100000 * 50 = 5e6, which is acceptable.

        Therefore, we must also during the dp for each k, store the value for residue 0 in a separate vector: `F0_values` of size M+1.

        Then after dp, we do the cycle detection for residue 0.

        Note: the sample code in the editorial does for each residue r, but in the query they use residue 0. So we only need residue 0.

        But wait, the state after a job might be residue r, and then we might haven't stored the entire dp table for other residues. 

        However, for the query, we start from residue 0, and then we only care about the residue 0 states.

        Summary of the algorithm:

          // Precomputation:
             T, n, list of jobs.

          // dp for profit levels 0..M (M=5*T)
             vector< vector<ll> > F_prev(6, vector<ll>(T, INF));
             // base: k=0

             F_prev[0] = F0;
             // also, we create a vector `res0` (for residue0) of size M+1, to be filled with INF.
             vector<ll> res0(M+1, INF); // res0[k] = minimal time to achieve profit k and end at residue 0.
             res0[0] = 0;

             for (int k = 1; k <= M; k++) {
                 vector<ll> G(T, INF); // for each x

                 // either: iterate over all jobs once (n=100000) and update G[x] for each job's x.

                     int x = jobs[i].x;
                     int p = jobs[i].p;
                     if (k < p) continue;
                     int prev_index = (k - p) % 6;
                     int r_i = jobs[i].r_i;
                     if (F_prev[prev_index][r_i] == INF) continue;

                         G[x] = candidate;

             }

          // Answer queries:

                     }
                 }
                 output best

        This for a query does a loop over k from 0 to M=100000, and q=20000, so 100000 * 20000 = 2e9, which is too slow.

        Therefore, we must precompute an array ans[z_j] for the query. But z_j up to 10^11.

        Instead, we can store the array `res0` for k in [0, M], and then for each k, we know we can add cycle_profit = (z_j - res0[k]) / best_cycle_time * best_cycle_profit.

        Then the profit = k + cycle_profit.

        We want the maximum over k in [0, M] of (k + floor((z_j - res0[k]) / best_cycle_time) * best_cycle_profit) for those res0[k]<=z_j.

        We can iterate k from 0 to M: only 100000 iterations per query? and q=20000, then 20000 * 100000 = 2e9.

        This is 2e9, which in C++ is about 20 seconds.

        Given the complexity, we must optimize the query to O(1) or O(M) in total.

        How about: we not iterate over k for each query, but we precompute an array for all z_j? But z_j up to 10^11.

        Alternatively, we can for a fixed z_j, consider only k where res0[k] is not INF. The number of such k is at most M+1=100001, and then we iterate over them. But we have 20000 queries, and 100001 per query -> 20000 * 100001 = 2e9.

        So we do to in the 

        Given the complexity, we output the solution and hope that the judge is not the worst-case.

        Or we optimize the query by offline and binary search? 

        But the function in k is not necessarily convex.

        Given the time, we output the solution as described.

        Steps:

          // Precompute dp for k=0..M (100000) -> 100000 * (100000 + 20000) = 12e9 iterations, which might be 12 seconds in C++.
          // Then cycle detection: O(M*50)=5e6.
          // Then for each query: iterate k=0..M (100000) and there are 20000 queries: 20000 * 100000 = 2e9.

        Total operations: 12e9 (dp) + 5e6 (cycle) + 2e9 (queries) = 14e9, which in C++ might be 14 seconds.

        We must optimize the queries.

        How about: for a fixed query z_j, we only want to consider k such that res0[k] <= z_j.

        We can sort the queries by z_j, and also sort the pairs (res0[k], k) by res0[k]. Then as we increase z_j, we add more k's.

        But then the cycle_add = (z_j - res0[k])//best_cycle_time * best_cycle_profit depends on z_j and res0[k].

        And we want for the current z_j: 

            max_{k: res0[k]<=z_j} [ k + best_cycle_profit * ((z_j - res0[k]) // best_cycle_time) ]

        Let floor_div = (z_j - res0[k]) // best_cycle_time = t_k.
        Then we have: 
            = k + best_cycle_profit * t_k
            = k + best_cycle_profit * ( (z_j - res0[k] - rem_k) / best_cycle_time )   [for some rem_k in [0, best_cycle_time-1]]

        = [k - best_cycle_profit * (res0[k] + rem_k)/ best_cycle_time] + best_cycle_profit * (z_j / best_cycle_time)

        Not linear.

        Given the complexity, we might iterate over the valid k for each query, but hope that the valid k is sparse. But in the worst-case, res0[0..M] might be not sparse.

        Alternatively, we can precompute an array: for each k, and for the best cycle, the profit function is linear in floor((z_j - res0[k])/ best_cycle_time). 

        But then for a fixed z_j, the value is defined for each k.

        There is no known faster method.

        Therefore, we must hope that the valid k is not the entire [0, M] and/or use faster language.

        Given the constraints, we output the code and hope for the best, or we might need to optimize by not iterate over all k in the query.

        Note: the sample input has small values.

        We output the code in the hope that the worst-case might be borderline in a fast C++.

        Or reduce M: the editorial says M=5*T, and T=20000, so M=100000. Is there a way to reduce M? 

        For instance, do we need to go up to 5*T? or can we stop when we have found a cycle?

        But the cycle might be found in the first few thousand, but the problem does not guarantee.

        Given the time, we output the code as described.

        Note: to avoid 2e9 in the queries, we can try to break early in the query: the valid k are those with res0[k]<=z_j. We can pre-store all valid (res0[k], k) in a vector and sort by res0[k]. Then for a query z_j, we can iterate over the valid k with res0[k]<=z_j. The number of valid k is at most M+1=100001, so it is the same.

        Therefore, the query takes 100001 iterations per query, and 20000 queries: 20000 * 100001 = 2e9.

        This is 2e9 iterations, which in C++ is about 2 seconds.

        So the total might be: 
          dp: 12e9 iterations (about 12 seconds)
          cycle: negligible.
          queries: 2e9 iterations (about 2 seconds)

          total 14 seconds.

        We must optimize the dp to be faster.

        Optimizations for the dp:
          - Use one-dimensional arrays and precompute.
          - Use faster arrays.
          - The job loop: try to make it cache-friendly.

        We will store the jobs in a single array and iterate linearly.

        Also, note: the inside of the job loop is:

             if (k < p) continue;
             candidate = l + F_prev[(k-p) % 6][r_i]

          This might be cache-unfriendly for F_prev and r_i. 

        To make it cache-friendly, we might precompute the accesses. Given the time, we output the code and hope for the best.

        Given the complexity, this solution might not pass in 4 seconds, but we have no better.

        We output the code as described, with detailed comments.

        Note: if INF is too large, we might use a custom (like 1e18) and hope.

        Let's code accordingly.
