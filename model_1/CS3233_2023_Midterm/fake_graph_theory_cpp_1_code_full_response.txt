To solve this problem, we need to compute the expected number of connected components in a graph constructed from two random permutations \( p \) and \( q \), each of size \( 2n \). The graph has \( 4n \) vertices and is built by adding three sets of edges: vertical edges connecting \( i \) to \( i + 2n \) for each \( i \), edges from permutation \( p \) connecting \( p_i \) to \( p_{i+n} \) for each \( i \), and edges from permutation \( q \) connecting \( q_i + 2n \) to \( q_{i+n} + 2n \) for each \( i \). The solution involves leveraging combinatorial mathematics and modular arithmetic to efficiently compute the result for large \( n \) (up to 3233) under a large modulus (1,000,003,233).

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The graph is constructed by combining three matchings: vertical edges (connecting left and right partitions), a perfect matching on the left partition defined by \( p \), and a perfect matching on the right partition defined by \( q \). The connected components in this graph correspond to cycles formed by these matchings.
2. **Key Insight**: The number of connected components in the graph can be derived by analyzing the permutation \( T = M_2' \circ M_1 \), where \( M_1 \) is the matching on the left partition and \( M_2' \) is the matching on the right partition translated to the left. The number of cycles in \( T \) relates to the number of connected components in the graph.
3. **Combinatorial Mathematics**: The solution involves summing over all possible cycle lengths in \( T \), considering the number of ways to choose vertices for the cycle and the number of ways to arrange the matchings on the remaining vertices. The formula involves factorials, double factorials, and modular inverses.
4. **Efficient Computation**: Precompute factorials, inverse factorials, powers of 4, and modular inverses up to the necessary limits (up to \( 2n \)) to efficiently compute the terms in the summation. The final result is derived by combining these precomputed values with the summation over cycle lengths.

### Solution Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;

const ll MOD = 1000003233;
const int MAX_N = 3233;
const int MAX_FACT = 2 * MAX_N + 10;

ll mod_pow(ll base, ll exp, ll mod) {
    ll result = 1;
    base %= mod;
    while (exp > 0) {
        if (exp & 1) 
            result = (result * base) % mod;
        base = (base * base) % mod;
        exp >>= 1;
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    vector<ll> F(MAX_FACT + 1, 1);
    vector<ll> invF(MAX_FACT + 1, 1);
    for (int i = 1; i <= MAX_FACT; i++) {
        F[i] = F[i - 1] * i % MOD;
    }
    invF[MAX_FACT] = mod_pow(F[MAX_FACT], MOD - 2, MOD);
    for (int i = MAX_FACT - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        invF[i] = invF[i + 1] * (i + 1) % MOD;
    }

    vector<ll> pow4(MAX_N + 1, 1);
    for (int i = 1; i <= MAX_N; i++) {
        pow4[i] = pow4[i - 1] * 4 % MOD;
    }

    vector<ll> inv_k(MAX_N + 1, 1);
    for (int k = 1; k <= MAX_N; k++) {
        inv_k[k] = mod_pow(k, MOD - 2, MOD);
    }

    ll inv2 = mod_pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD);

    ll total_sum = 0;
    for (int k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
        int index_2n_minus_2k = 2 * n - 2 * k;
        if (index_2n_minus_2k < 0) break;
        ll term = F[index_2n_minus_2k] * F[index_2n_minus_2k] % MOD;
        term = term * pow4[k] % MOD;
        term = term * inv_k[k] % MOD;
        term = term * invF[2 * n - k] % MOD;
        term = term * invF[n - k] % MOD;
        term = term * invF[n - k] % MOD;
        total_sum = (total_sum + term) % MOD;
    }

    ll result = F[2 * n] * F[n] % MOD;
    result = result * F[n] % MOD;
    result = result * total_sum % MOD;
    result = result * inv2 % MOD;

    cout << result << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Precomputation**: Factorials \( F \) and their modular inverses \( invF \) up to \( 2n \) are precomputed to efficiently compute combinations and other terms.
2. **Powers of 4**: The array \( pow4 \) stores \( 4^k \mod \text{MOD} \) for quick access during the summation.
3. **Modular Inverses for Integers**: The array \( inv_k \) stores modular inverses of integers up to \( n \) to handle divisions in the summation terms.
4. **Summation Over Cycle Lengths**: For each possible cycle length \( k \) from 1 to \( n \), compute the contribution to the total number of cycles in \( T \). This involves:
   - Selecting \( k \) vertices for the cycle.
   - Arranging them in a directed cycle.
   - Accounting for the matchings on the remaining vertices.
5. **Final Result**: Combine the precomputed values and the summation result, adjusting by the modular inverse of 2 to derive the expected number of connected components scaled by \( (2n)!^2 \).

This approach efficiently computes the result by leveraging combinatorial mathematics and modular arithmetic, ensuring correctness and performance even for the upper constraint \( n = 3233 \).
