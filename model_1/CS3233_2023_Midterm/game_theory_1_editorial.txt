### Approach
The problem involves a game played on a row of cells where two players take turns moving a token. The goal is to compute the final score for each starting position from 1 to \( n \), assuming both players play optimally—the first player (maximizer) aims to maximize the score, while the second player (minimizer) aims to minimize it.

#### Key Insights
1. **Game Representation**: The game can be modeled using dynamic programming (DP) on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) because moves only go forward (to higher indices), ensuring no cycles.
2. **State Definition**: Define two DP arrays:
   - `dp0[i]` represents the optimal score when starting at cell \( i \) and it's the maximizer's turn.
   - `dp1[i]` represents the optimal score when starting at cell \( i \) and it's the minimizer's turn.
3. **Transition**: For each cell \( i \), the current player adds \( a_i \) to the score and chooses a move \( k \) (a multiple of \( p_i \)) to either:
   - End the game immediately (if \( i + k > n \)), resulting in a score of \( a_i \).
   - Move to cell \( i + k \) (if \( i + k \leq n \)), continuing the game with the opponent's turn.
4. **Optimal Play**:
   - The maximizer chooses the move that maximizes the score: `dp0[i] = max(a_i, a_i + max_{j} dp1[j])`.
   - The minimizer chooses the move that minimizes the score: `dp1[i] = min(a_i, a_i + min_{j} dp0[j])`.
5. **Efficiency**: To handle transitions efficiently:
   - **Small Steps (\( p_i \leq \sqrt{n} \))**: Use precomputed arrays to store the best values for each residue class modulo \( d \) (for \( d \leq \sqrt{n} \)).
   - **Large Steps (\( p_i > \sqrt{n} \))**: Directly iterate over multiples since the number of multiples is \( O(\sqrt{n}) \).

#### Algorithm Selection
- **Dynamic Programming**: Process cells from right to left (since moves go to higher indices) to ensure dependencies are resolved.
- **Sqrt Decomposition**: Separate the step sizes into small (\( \leq \sqrt{n} \)) and large (\( > \sqrt{n} \)) to balance between precomputation and direct iteration, optimizing the overall complexity.
- **Complexity**: \( O(n \sqrt{n}) \) per test case, feasible given constraints (sum of \( n \) across test cases is \( \leq 300,000 \)).

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: For each test case, read the number of cells \( n \), the array \( p \) (indicating step sizes), and the array \( a \) (score values for each cell).
2. **Precomputation for Small Steps**: For each step size \( d \leq \sqrt{n} \), initialize arrays to store the maximum `dp1` and minimum `dp0` values for each residue class modulo \( d \).
3. **Dynamic Programming Processing**:
   - **State Processing**: Process cells from \( n \) down to \( 1 \). For each cell \( i \):
     - **Large Steps (\( p_i > \sqrt{n} \))**: Directly iterate over valid multiples to compute the best values for transitions.
     - **Small Steps (\( p_i \leq \sqrt{n} \))**: Use precomputed residue classes to efficiently retrieve the best values.
   - **State Update**: Update `dp0[i]` and `dp1[i]` considering both ending the game immediately or moving to a valid next cell.
   - **Residue Update**: For each small step size, update the residue class arrays with the current state's values for future use.
4. **Output**: After processing all cells, output the results for each starting position from 1 to \( n \) for the test case.

This approach efficiently handles the game's optimal play using dynamic programming and sqrt decomposition to manage transitions, ensuring optimal performance within constraints.
