To solve this problem, we need to decompose a given matrix \( A \) into the sum of the minimum number of absolutely symmetric matrices. An absolutely symmetric matrix \( T \) satisfies \( |T_{i,j}| = |T_{j,i}| \) for all \( i, j \). If no such decomposition exists, we should return -1.

### Approach
1. **Check for Decomposition Feasibility**: 
   - For every off-diagonal pair \((i, j)\) where \( i < j \), the sum \( A_{i,j} + A_{j,i} \) must be even. This is because each absolutely symmetric matrix contributes equally to the sums of pairs \((i,j)\) and \((j,i)\) in terms of parity. If any pair violates this condition, decomposition is impossible.

2. **Check for Absolute Symmetry**:
   - If the matrix \( A \) is already absolutely symmetric (i.e., \( |A_{i,j}| = |A_{j,i}| \) for all \( i, j \)), then \( k = 1 \) suffices, and \( A \) itself is the solution.

3. **Decompose into Two Matrices**:
   - If \( A \) is not absolutely symmetric, decompose it into two absolutely symmetric matrices \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \):
     - **Matrix \( X_1 \)**:
       - Diagonal entries are 0.
       - Off-diagonal entries are \( (A_{i,j} - A_{j,i}) / 2 \).
     - **Matrix \( X_2 \)**:
       - Diagonal entries are \( A_{i,i} \).
       - Off-diagonal entries are \( (A_{i,j} + A_{j,i}) / 2 \).

### Solution Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<vector<long long>> A(n, vector<long long>(n));
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            cin >> A[i][j];
        }
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            if ((A[i][j] & 1) != (A[j][i] & 1)) {
                cout << -1 << endl;
                return 0;
            }
        }
    }

    bool abs_sym = true;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            long long a_val = A[i][j];
            long long b_val = A[j][i];
            if (a_val < 0) a_val = -a_val;
            if (b_val < 0) b_val = -b_val;
            if (a_val != b_val) {
                abs_sym = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (!abs_sym) break;
    }

    if (abs_sym) {
        cout << 1 << endl;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                cout << A[i][j];
                if (j < n - 1) cout << " ";
            }
            cout << endl;
        }
    } else {
        cout << 2 << endl;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i == j) {
                    cout << 0;
                } else {
                    long long diff = A[i][j] - A[j][i];
                    cout << diff / 2;
                }
                if (j < n - 1) cout << " ";
            }
            cout << endl;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i == j) {
                    cout << A[i][j];
                } else {
                    long long sum_val = A[i][j] + A[j][i];
                    cout << sum_val / 2;
                }
                if (j < n - 1) cout << " ";
            }
            cout << endl;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Feasibility Check**: The code first checks if the sum of every off-diagonal pair \((i, j)\) is even. If not, it outputs -1 immediately.
2. **Absolute Symmetry Check**: The code then checks if the matrix \( A \) is absolutely symmetric by verifying \( |A_{i,j}| = |A_{j,i}| \) for all \( i, j \). If true, it outputs \( A \) as the solution with \( k = 1 \).
3. **Decomposition**: If \( A \) is not absolutely symmetric, the code decomposes it into two matrices \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \). \( X_1 \) handles the antisymmetric part (differences scaled by 2), and \( X_2 \) handles the symmetric part (sums scaled by 2) along with the diagonal entries. The sum of \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \) reconstructs \( A \), and both matrices are absolutely symmetric by construction.

This approach efficiently checks for decomposition feasibility and constructs the minimal decomposition when possible, adhering to the problem constraints.
