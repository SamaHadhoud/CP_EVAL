### Problem Analysis
The problem involves dynamically maintaining a sorted line of cats (by their heights, which correspond to their IDs) and efficiently computing the total discontentment after each insertion or removal. The discontentment of each cat depends on its adjacent cats in the line and predefined dislike relationships. The challenge is to handle up to 300,000 operations efficiently, especially since the total number of cats can be as large as \(10^9\), but only a subset (at most 300,000) is active at any time.

#### Key Insights:
1. **Dynamic Set Handling**: The line must always remain sorted by cat IDs. Insertions and removals affect only the immediate neighbors of the modified cat.
2. **Discontentment Calculation**: For each cat in the line, its discontentment is determined by:
   - Whether it has a previous and/or next neighbor.
   - Whether it dislikes these neighbors, based on a predefined set of dislike pairs.
   - The values are:
     - 3233 if it dislikes both neighbors.
     - 323 if it dislikes only the previous neighbor.
     - 32 if it dislikes only the next neighbor.
     - 3 otherwise (including when it has no neighbors).
3. **Efficiency**: Each insertion or removal affects at most three cats (the cat being modified and its two neighbors). Thus, we can update the total discontentment by recalculating only these cats' contributions per operation.

### Algorithm Selection
1. **Data Structures**:
   - **Balanced BST (e.g., `std::set` in C++)**: To maintain the current line of cats in sorted order, allowing \(O(\log N)\) time for insertions, deletions, and neighbor queries.
   - **Hash Set (e.g., `std::unordered_set`)**: To store dislike pairs for \(O(1)\) average time checks. Each dislike pair \((x, y)\) (with \(x < y\)) is stored as a unique key (e.g., \(x \times 10^{10} + y\)).

2. **Operations**:
   - **Insertion**:
     1. Find the immediate predecessor and successor of the new cat in the current set.
     2. Subtract the current discontentment of these neighbors.
     3. Insert the new cat.
     4. Recompute and add the discontentment of the new cat and its neighbors (now including the new cat).
   - **Removal**:
     1. Find the immediate predecessor and successor of the cat to be removed.
     2. Subtract the current discontentment of the cat and its neighbors.
     3. Remove the cat.
     4. Recompute and add the discontentment of the neighbors (now adjacent to each other).

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**:
  - Each insertion or removal involves \(O(\log K)\) operations for BST operations (where \(K\) is the number of cats in the line, up to 300,000).
  - Each discontentment computation involves \(O(\log K)\) for neighbor lookups and \(O(1)\) for dislike checks.
  - With up to 3 cats updated per operation, the total time per query is \(O(\log K)\), leading to \(O(Q \log K)\) overall (about \(300,000 \times \log_2(300,000) \approx 5.7\) million operations).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(M + Q)\) to store dislike pairs and the current line (feasible within 1024 MB).

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: The dislike pairs are stored in a hash set for efficient \(O(1)\) checks. The line is maintained as a sorted set.
2. **Discontentment Calculation**: For a cat, the function checks its neighbors in the line and uses the dislike set to determine its discontentment value.
3. **Insertion**:
   - The predecessors and successors are found before insertion.
   - Their current discontentment is subtracted from the total.
   - After insertion, the new discontentment of the affected cats (including the new cat) is added back.
4. **Removal**:
   - The predecessors and successors are found before removal.
   - The discontentment of the cat and its neighbors is subtracted.
   - After removal, the neighbors' new discontentment (now adjacent) is added back.
5. **Efficiency**: Each operation efficiently updates only the affected cats, leveraging BST operations and hash lookups to handle large input sizes within constraints.

This approach ensures optimal performance and correctness by focusing updates only on relevant segments of the line after each operation.
