We are given a random permutation of length n, and we want to count the number of subsequences that have the same length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) as the entire sequence.

Let L = length of the LIS of the entire sequence.

Note: Since the input permutation is random, we can assume that the LIS length is about O(sqrt(n))? However, we cannot rely solely on that for worst-case. But note that the problem states that the permutation is random, so we can use algorithms that work well on random permutations.

However, we must design an algorithm that works for n up to 100,000.

The problem: Count the number of subsequences such that the length of their LIS is L (the LIS of the entire sequence).

Step 1: Compute the LIS length of the entire sequence, and also we need more information.

But note: We are not only interested in the length, but we also need to know which subsequences have LIS length equal to L.

Idea: We can use the classical DP for LIS: dp[i] = length of the LIS ending at index i.

We can compute dp[i] with a Fenwick tree or segment tree in O(n log n). Then, L = max(dp[i]).

But note: We also need to consider the entire structure of the LIS. In fact, we need to count the subsequences that have LIS length exactly L.

However, counting all subsequences with LIS length exactly L is difficult. But note the problem: we only care about those that are indistinguishable from the entire sequence, meaning they have the same LIS length as the entire sequence. So we are counting the subsequences whose LIS length is L (which is the maximum possible for the entire sequence).

But note: In the entire sequence, the LIS length is L. However, a subsequence might have LIS length L without containing any increasing subsequence of length L? Actually, if a subsequence has LIS length L, then it must contain an increasing subsequence of length L.

But note: The problem does not require that the subsequence must be contiguous. It can be any subsequence.

How to count the number of subsequences of the permutation such that the length of the LIS is L?

This is a classic problem in combinatorics? But note: the permutation is random, which might help.

However, we can use the following:

We are going to use the concept of "LIS counting" with the help of the RSK algorithm? But that might be too heavy.

Alternatively, we can use the following idea:

1. Compute the DP for the entire sequence: dp[i] = length of the LIS ending at i.

2. Let L = max(dp[i]). Then we are to count the subsequences such that the maximum value of dp[i] over the indices in the subsequence is L? Not exactly: because if we take a subsequence, the dp[i] computed in the original sequence for an element might not be the same as in the subsequence.

Therefore, we cannot use the original dp[i] for the subsequence.

Alternative idea: Use the method of decomposing the permutation by the LIS. We know that the entire sequence has an LIS of length L. We also know that the permutation can be partitioned into L decreasing subsequences (by Dilworth's theorem? Actually, the dual of Dilworth: the minimum number of decreasing subsequences needed to cover the permutation is the length of the longest increasing subsequence). But note: it's the other way: the minimum number of chains (decreasing) in a partially ordered set (with the natural order) is the size of the largest antichain. However, here we have a permutation. The Erdős–Szekeres theorem says that any permutation of length n has either an increasing subsequence of length at least ceil(sqrt(n)) or a decreasing one of length at least ceil(sqrt(n)), but that's asymptotic.

Actually, we can use the following:

We are going to use the "antichain" decomposition? Or we can use the classical "greedy" decomposition into decreasing subsequences? How?

But note: the problem says the permutation is random. In random permutations, the LIS length is about 2*sqrt(n). So L is about 2*sqrt(n). Then we can design an O(n * L) solution? That would be about 100,000 * 2*sqrt(100,000) ~ 100,000 * 2*300 = 60e6, which might be borderline in C++ in 1s? But we have modulus and we are counting, so we need to design carefully.

However, note that the problem says the permutation is random, so we can use algorithms that exploit the expected L being about 2*sqrt(n). But worst-case the LIS length can be up to n. However, the input is random, so worst-case doesn't occur? But we must design for the worst-case n=100,000? Actually, worst-case for a random permutation the LIS length is about 2*sqrt(n). But worst-case over all permutations can be n, but the problem says "random permutation", so we can assume that the LIS length is about 2*sqrt(n). So we can design an algorithm that is efficient when L is small.

But the problem says: "SoCCat simply gave you a random permutation", so we can assume L is about 2*sqrt(n). Then we can design an algorithm that runs in O(n * L) or O(n * L * log n) which is acceptable.

How to count the number of subsequences with LIS length exactly L?

We can use dynamic programming that goes as follows:

Let f(i, j) = the number of ways to form an increasing subsequence of length j ending at i, and then use that to count the total number of subsequences? But note: a subsequence that has LIS length L might have multiple increasing subsequences of length L, and we want to avoid overcounting? Actually, we can use the following:

We want to count the subsequences that have at least one increasing subsequence of length L and no increasing subsequence of length L+1.

But that is difficult because we are counting sets. Alternatively, we can use inclusion-exclusion: count the subsequences that have LIS length >= L, and subtract those that have LIS length >= L+1? But note: the entire sequence has L as the maximum, so in the entire permutation, the maximum LIS length is L. Therefore, any subsequence cannot have an LIS longer than L? Actually, no: because if we remove some elements, the LIS might become shorter, but it cannot become longer than the LIS of the entire sequence? Why? Because the subsequence is contained in the entire sequence. Therefore, the LIS of any subsequence is at most L.

Therefore, we only need to count the subsequences that have LIS length >= L? Actually, we want exactly L. But since the maximum is L, then having LIS length >= L is the same as having LIS length exactly L.

So the problem reduces to: count the number of subsequences that contain at least one increasing subsequence of length L.

But note: if a subsequence contains an increasing subsequence of length L, then its LIS is at least L. And since the entire sequence has maximum LIS length L, then the subsequence cannot exceed L. Therefore, the condition is equivalent.

Thus: we want to count the number of subsequences that contain at least one increasing subsequence of length L.

How to count that? We can use the principle of counting the subsequences that contain a particular increasing subsequence of length L? But there can be many such increasing subsequences, and they overlap.

Alternatively, we can use complementary counting? But that seems difficult.

We can use the following: Count the total number of subsequences that do not contain any increasing subsequence of length L, and subtract from the total number of subsequences? But then we are counting the complement. However, note: the condition for the subsequence to have LIS length < L is that it does not contain an increasing subsequence of length L. But we are actually interested in the ones that have at least one increasing subsequence of length L. Then:

Answer = (total number of subsequences) - (number of subsequences that do not contain an increasing subsequence of length L)

But the total number of subsequences is 2^n. However, we cannot compute the second term easily.

Alternatively, we can use a DP that counts the number of subsequences that avoid an increasing subsequence of length L? That seems difficult.

Another idea: Use the method of "counting the number of subsequences that contain at least one increasing subsequence of length L" by inclusion-exclusion over the increasing subsequences? But that is exponential in the number of increasing subsequences.

But note: the number of increasing subsequences of length L might be exponential.

Therefore, we need a better approach.

We can use the following idea:

We want to count the subsequences that contain at least one increasing subsequence of length L. We can use the concept of "minimal" increasing subsequences? Or we can use a DP that traverses the sequence and records the state as the last element of an increasing subsequence and the length of the increasing subsequence. But we are not only forming one increasing subsequence, we are forming a set that might have multiple increasing subsequences.

Alternatively, we can use the following: we can use the longest increasing subsequence DP to count the number of increasing subsequences of length L? But that counts the increasing subsequences, not the entire subsequences that contain at least one increasing subsequence of length L.

We need to count the entire set of indices that form a subsequence (which is arbitrary as long as it contains at least one increasing subsequence of length L).

We can use the following: for each increasing subsequence of length L, the set of subsequences that contain that particular one is 2^(n - |indices in that increasing subsequence|). But then we overcount because a subsequence might contain multiple increasing subsequences of length L.

Therefore, we need inclusion-exclusion:

Let S be the set of all increasing subsequences of length L. For each such increasing subsequence i, let A_i be the set of subsequences that contain the increasing subsequence i.

Then we want |Union_{i in S} A_i|.

By inclusion-exclusion:

|Union| = sum_{nonempty J ⊆ S} (-1)^(|J|+1) |∩_{i in J} A_i|

But the intersection over J is the set of subsequences that contain every increasing subsequence in J. That is, they contain the union of the indices of the increasing subsequences in J.

But the set J can be arbitrary, and the union of indices might be large, and the number of J is exponential.

So inclusion-exclusion is not feasible.

Alternative idea: use the method of "minimal" elements or use a generating function? 

Another idea: use the concept of "transitive closure" for the increasing subsequences? 

Actually, we can use the following: we are only concerned with the condition that the subsequence must contain at least one increasing subsequence of length L. We can use a DP that goes:

Let F(i) = the number of subsequences of the prefix [1..i] that do not contain an increasing subsequence of length L, and then the answer would be 2^n - F(n) (if we define F for the entire sequence). But how to compute F(i)?

We need to design a state that captures the entire structure of the increasing subsequences that we have. The state must remember the entire history? The classical way to avoid an increasing subsequence of length L is to use the Erdős–Szekeres theorem: the sequence can be partitioned into L-1 decreasing sequences. Then we can use DP with state as a tuple of L-1 elements (the last elements of the decreasing sequences). This is known as the "Ulam" style. But the state size is O(n^(L-1)) which is too expensive.

However, note that L is about 2*sqrt(n) and for n=100,000, L is about 600, so L-1 is 599, and a state of 599 dimensions is impossible.

Another idea: we can use the method of "dominated states" in the decomposition. There is a well-known result: the number of states is the number of antichains in the poset? But that is also too big.

Alternative approach: 

We know that the entire permutation has an LIS of length L. We can compute the following:

- Let dp[i] = length of the LIS ending at i.

- We also compute cnt[i] = the number of increasing subsequences of length dp[i] ending at i. But note: that counts the increasing subsequences, not the entire subsequences that have an LIS of length L.

But we are interested in entire subsequences.

We can use the following: a subsequence has LIS length L if and only if the maximum dp[i] in the subsequence is L. But note: the dp[i] defined in the entire sequence for an element i is the length of the LIS ending at i that is entirely within the entire sequence. However, if we take a subsequence, the actual LIS ending at i might be different.

Therefore, we cannot use the original dp[i] for the subsequence.

But we can use the following: in the entire sequence, the element i has a "rank" in the increasing subsequence. We can use the classical decomposition: 

Let's define:

- g[k] = the smallest tail value of an increasing subsequence of length k in the entire sequence.

But we are not building the LIS greedily for the entire sequence only. We need to consider the subsequences.

However, there is a known technique: the "inversion" of the LIS counting.

But note: the problem is symmetric for the entire sequence and the subsequences because the subsequences are taken from the entire sequence. We can use the following:

Let F be the set of indices that are part of at least one increasing subsequence of length L. Then, any subsequence that does not contain an increasing subsequence of length L must avoid at least one element in every increasing subsequence of length L. 

By Dilworth's theorem, the set F can be partitioned into L antichains? Or rather, the entire set F is the union of the elements that appear in increasing subsequences of length L.

Actually, the elements that appear in at least one increasing subsequence of length L are called the elements of the "critical set". 

Moreover, we have the following: the entire set F can be partitioned into L decreasing sequences. Why? Because if we take the decomposition: 

- For each k from 1 to L, let D_k be the set of elements that are the k-th element in some increasing subsequence of length L. Then, each D_k must be a decreasing sequence? Not exactly: they form an antichain? Actually, no: in fact, if two elements are in D_k, then they cannot be increasing? Why? Because if x and y in D_k and x<y and x appears before y, then we could extend an increasing subsequence ending at x to y? Then the increasing subsequence ending at x could be extended to y, so y would be in a later position? Actually, the sets D_k are "layers" and within each layer, the elements are decreasing? 

In fact, we can define:

Let f(i) = the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at i.

Let g(i) = the length of the longest increasing subsequence starting at i.

Then, an element i is in an increasing subsequence of length L if and only if f(i) + g(i) - 1 >= L? Actually, if we consider the entire sequence, then an element i is in an increasing subsequence of length L if and only if f(i) + g(i) - 1 >= L. But note: it could be that there is an increasing subsequence that uses i and has length L without necessarily being the one that extends from the beginning to the end? Actually, we can break the increasing subsequence into the part before i and after i. So:

The element i is in an increasing subsequence of length L if and only if there exists an increasing subsequence of length L that passes through i. And this is equivalent to: f(i) + g(i) - 1 >= L.

But note: it might be that f(i) + g(i) - 1 > L, then i is in an increasing subsequence of length > L? But wait, the entire sequence has LIS length L, so f(i) + g(i) - 1 cannot exceed L? Actually, it can: because the increasing subsequence that ends at i and then continues after i might not be the same as the global LIS. However, the global LIS is L, so the longest increasing subsequence that passes through i is at most L. Therefore, f(i) + g(i) - 1 <= L. But also, if an element i is in an increasing subsequence of length L, then we must have f(i) + g(i) - 1 >= L. Therefore, we have:

f(i) + g(i) - 1 = L   for all i that are in some increasing subsequence of length L.

And for other elements, f(i) + g(i) - 1 < L.

Therefore, the set F = { i | f(i) + g(i) - 1 = L }.

Moreover, we can compute f(i) and g(i) easily:

- f(i) = length of LIS ending at i: we can compute by a Fenwick tree: 
   f(i) = 1 + max_{j<i and a[j] < a[i]} f(j)

- g(i) = length of the longest increasing subsequence starting at i: we can do a symmetric DP from right to left:
   g(i) = 1 + max_{j>i and a[j] > a[i]} g(j)

Both can be done in O(n log n).

Then, we know that the entire sequence has L = max_i f(i) (or also max_i g(i)).

Now, we know F.

But then, what? 

We want to count the subsequences that contain at least one increasing subsequence of length L. 

Note: Such a subsequence must contain at least one increasing subsequence of length L. And that increasing subsequence must be entirely contained in F? Why? Because if an element i is not in F, then it cannot be part of an increasing subsequence of length L. Therefore, the subsequence must contain some subset of F that includes at least one increasing subsequence of length L.

Moreover, the elements not in F (call it G) can be chosen arbitrarily? Why? Because adding any element from G to a subsequence that already contains an increasing subsequence of length L won't create a new increasing subsequence of length L? Actually, it might? But wait: an element in G has f(i)+g(i)-1 < L, so it cannot be part of an increasing subsequence of length L. Moreover, even if we combine it with others, the entire increasing subsequence cannot exceed the potential at each element. Therefore, adding an element from G cannot extend an existing increasing subsequence to length L? Actually, it might complete an increasing subsequence of length L? 

Example: Consider a sequence [1, 3, 2]. The entire sequence has L=2. The elements: 
   a1=1: f=1, g=2 (because we can take 1 and then 3) -> 1+2-1=2 -> in F.
   a2=3: f=2, g=1 -> 2+1-1=2 -> in F.
   a3=2: f=2 (because we can take 1 and then 2), g=1 -> 2+1-1=2 -> in F.

But wait, the element 2 is in F? Then there is no G.

So let me take a sample: [4,1,3,2] as in sample.

Compute f and g for [4,1,3,2]:

f(1)=1 (element 4)
f(2)=1 (element 1: no element before that is <1)
f(3)=2 (element 3: we can take 1 then 3)
f(4)=2 (element 2: we can take 1 then 2)

g(1)=? 
   from 4: we can only take nothing after? so g(1)=1.
g(2)=3: because we can take 1, then 3, then 2? no, wait: increasing subsequence starting at 1: 
   we can take 1, then 3? -> 2, then after 3 we have 2 which is less than 3, so we cannot take. 
   Actually, from 1: we can take 3? but then after 3, there is 2 which is less, so only 1 and 3? -> g(2)=2? 
   But wait, the increasing subsequence starting at 1: we can take 1 and then 3 -> length 2, or 1 and then 2 -> length 2? 
   So g(2)=2.

Similarly, g(3)=1 (only 3) and g(4)=1 (only 2).

Then f(i)+g(i)-1:
i1: 1+1-1=1
i2: 1+2-1=2
i3: 2+1-1=2
i4: 2+1-1=2

So F = {i2, i3, i4} = {1,3,2}. 

But the entire sequence has L=2.

Now, we want the subsequences that contain at least one increasing subsequence of length 2.

But note: if we take the element 1 (a2=1) and then 2 (a4=2) -> that is an increasing subsequence of length 2. Also, 1 and 3 (a2=1 and a3=3) is an increasing subsequence of length 2.

But also, if we take only the element 1, then the LIS is 1 -> not 2. So we must have at least one increasing subsequence of length 2.

Now, the set G is {4} (a1=4). 

Can we freely include 4? If we include 4 and also 1 and 2, then the subsequence is [4,1,2]. The LIS of [4,1,2] is [1,2] (length 2). So including 4 does not break the condition.

But what if we include 4 and not include any increasing subsequence of length 2? For example, the subsequence [4] -> LIS=1, [4,1] -> LIS=1, [4,2] -> LIS=1, [4,1,2] -> LIS=2.

So if we include 4, we must also include an increasing subsequence of length 2 from F to have the overall LIS=2.

Therefore, the condition is: the subsequence must include at least one increasing subsequence of length 2 from the set F.

But note: the set F is {1,3,2}. However, we can choose any subset of G arbitrarily, but we must choose a subset of F that contains at least one increasing subsequence of length L.

So the count is: 
   (number of ways to choose a subset of G) * (number of ways to choose a subset of F that contains at least one increasing subsequence of length L)

The number of ways to choose a subset of G is 2^{|G|}. 

Then, we need to count: the number of subsets of F that contain at least one increasing subsequence of length L.

But note: in the set F, the structure is the same as the original sequence restricted to F. And the entire set F has the property that every element is in some increasing subsequence of length L. However, the entire set F might have a longer increasing subsequence? But the entire sequence has LIS length L, so F cannot have an increasing subsequence longer than L.

In fact, the set F has the property that its longest increasing subsequence is exactly L? Not necessarily: it might be that F has an increasing subsequence of length L, but not longer. Actually, the entire sequence has LIS length L, so F has LIS length at least L (because it contains an increasing subsequence of length L) and at most L. So F has LIS length L.

Therefore, we need to count the number of subsets of F that have LIS length L. But note: a subset of F might not be contiguous? And we must count exactly those that have an increasing subsequence of length L.

But wait, we already know that the entire set F has LIS length L, but a subset of F might have a smaller LIS. However, we want the subsets that have LIS length L.

So now the problem reduces to: given a set F (which is a subsequence of the permutation, but not contiguous) and we know that the entire set F has LIS length L, count the number of subsets of F that also have LIS length L.

But note: the set F is the set of elements that are in some increasing subsequence of length L. And the structure of F is that it is the union of all such elements.

How to count the number of subsets of F that have LIS length L?

We can use the same idea: such a subset must contain at least one increasing subsequence of length L. And since the entire set F has no increasing subsequence of length L+1, then any subset that has an increasing subsequence of length L has LIS length exactly L.

Therefore, we need: the number of subsets of F that contain at least one increasing subsequence of length L.

Now, we are back to the same problem but on F. But F is a subset of indices, and the sequence F is the values at those indices in the original order.

But note: F is not necessarily a contiguous segment. However, the values in F are the values that appear in the positions of F.

But we can consider the relative order: the values in F form a permutation of a subset.

Now, we want to count the number of subsets of F that contain at least one increasing subsequence of length L.

This is the same as: 
   total subsets of F: 2^{|F|} 
   minus the number of subsets of F that have no increasing subsequence of length L.

But how to count the number of subsets of F that have no increasing subsequence of length L? 

This is equivalent to: the number of subsets of F whose longest increasing subsequence is at most L-1.

And this is a classical problem: the number of subsets of a permutation that avoid an increasing subsequence of length L.

We can use the method of "antichain decomposition" and dynamic programming with state being a tuple of the last elements of L-1 decreasing sequences? 

But the size of F is |F|, and we know that the entire set F has LIS length L, so the minimum number of decreasing sequences needed to cover F is L (by Dilworth: the size of the largest antichain is the minimum number of chains needed to cover the poset. Here, the antichain is the longest increasing subsequence). 

Actually, we need the dual: the minimum number of decreasing subsequences needed to cover the set is the size of the largest antichain, which is the LIS length = L. 

Therefore, we can cover F with L decreasing sequences.

But for counting subsets that avoid an increasing subsequence of length L, we can use the following:

We traverse the elements in increasing order of index? and we assign each element to one of L-1 decreasing sequences? and the state is the last element in each of the L-1 decreasing sequences. The state is a tuple of L-1 numbers (the last element of the decreasing sequence, which is the value of the element). 

We can maintain the state as a sorted tuple of the last elements of the decreasing sequences, and each time we add an element, we put it in the first decreasing sequence that has last element > current element (so that the decreasing sequence remains decreasing). If we can put it in a decreasing sequence, then we do, and update that state. Otherwise, we cannot put it? But we are forming a set: we can choose to skip an element.

We are counting the subsets. So we do:

Let DP[S] = the number of ways to form a subset (from the elements processed so far) that has state S, where S is a tuple of the last elements of the L-1 decreasing sequences (in increasing order of the last elements?).

But the state space is the set of increasing sequences of length L-1? and the values are the values of the elements. The values are between 1 and n, and L-1 is about 600, so the state space is huge.

However, we can note: the state is always an increasing sequence (the last elements of the decreasing sequences, and we maintain them in increasing order). Moreover, when we add an element x, we find the first decreasing sequence whose last element is greater than x? and we update that decreasing sequence to have last element = x. If there is no such sequence, then we cannot include x without creating an increasing subsequence of length L? Actually, if we include x and we cannot assign it to any decreasing sequence, that means that there is an increasing subsequence of length L in the set? 

But note: we are only allowed to have increasing subsequences of length at most L-1. 

In fact, the classical result: if we have a set and we can assign each element to one of k decreasing sequences (and the assignment is greedy: put x in the first decreasing sequence whose last element is > x, and if none, open a new one), then the minimum k for which we can cover the set is the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

Therefore, the state S is an increasing sequence of length at most L-1 (exactly L-1, we can pad with infinity for the unused ones). But the state is the tuple of the last elements of the decreasing sequences (in increasing order). 

The state can be stored as a sorted list. The size of the state space is the number of increasing sequences of length L-1? which is C(n, L-1) which is huge.

But there is a known optimization: the state is always a subset of the values we have seen, and it is increasing. Moreover, the values in the state are the minima of the last elements? 

But also, the state is completely determined by the set of values that are the last elements, and we only care about the relative order. We can normalize by the values? 

However, there is a known fact: the number of states is at most the number of increasing sequences of length L-1 that can appear, and in a random permutation, the state space is not too large? But worst-case it is exponential.

But note: we are in a random permutation, and the size of F is at most n, but we hope that the state space is not too large. However, worst-case it is O(n^(L-1)) which is too much.

Alternatively, we can use generating functions and the hook-length formula for the decomposition? 

But there is a known result: the number of subsets that avoid an increasing subsequence of length L is equal to the number of ways to assign the elements to L-1 decreasing sequences, and then take any subset independently in each decreasing sequence? But note: the elements in the same decreasing sequence are not independent: we can take at most one element from each decreasing sequence? Actually, no: we can take any subset from a decreasing sequence, and it will not contain an increasing subsequence of length 2? Actually, a decreasing sequence has no increasing subsequence of length 2. So the entire set will have no increasing subsequence of length L if we take at most one element from each of L-1 decreasing sequences? 

That is not true: because the decreasing sequences are not disjoint in terms of the values. We have a covering by L-1 decreasing sequences, and then we can take at most one element from each decreasing sequence, and then the set is an antichain? But then the longest increasing subsequence is at most 1? 

This is not matching.

Actually, the covering by decreasing sequences does not help for taking arbitrary subsets. The condition is: if we have a covering of the set F by L-1 decreasing sequences, then any subset that is a union of any elements from these sequences might have an increasing subsequence of length up to the number of decreasing sequences that we take one element from? because if we take one element from each of L-1 decreasing sequences, then these elements might form an increasing subsequence of length L-1. But we want to avoid an increasing subsequence of length L, so it is allowed.

Therefore, the condition is automatically satisfied: any subset of a set that is covered by L-1 decreasing sequences will have LIS at most L-1. And conversely, if a set has LIS at most L-1, then it can be partitioned into L-1 decreasing sequences (by Dilworth's dual: the minimum number of decreasing sequences needed to cover the set is the size of the largest antichain, which is the LIS length, which is <= L-1). 

Therefore, the number of subsets of F that have no increasing subsequence of length L is exactly the number of ways to assign the elements of F to L-1 independent decreasing sequences, and then take any subset within each decreasing sequence. But note: the covering is not fixed! We have one fixed covering? 

Actually, the classical result does not give a fixed covering. But there is a greedy covering: the patience sorting method. In fact, we can simulate the greedy algorithm for covering with decreasing sequences.

But then the catch: the number of valid subsets is the product over the decreasing sequences of (1 + count_i) where count_i is the number of elements in the i-th decreasing sequence? But that would be if the sequences were disjoint and independent, but they are not: the elements are assigned to a particular decreasing sequence. And if we have a fixed covering, then any choice of elements from the decreasing sequences will avoid an increasing subsequence of length L. 

However, the same element cannot be in two sequences, so the assignment to sequences is a partition. Then, the number of subsets is the product over the sequences of (1 + size_i). 

But wait: in the entire set F, if we fix a partition into L-1 decreasing sequences, then any subset we take will be a union of some elements from these sequences, and within each sequence we can take any subset (which will be decreasing, so no increasing subsequence of length 2). And across sequences, any increasing subsequence can take at most one element from each sequence, so at most L-1 elements. Therefore, the entire set has LIS <= L-1.

Moreover, every subset that has LIS <= L-1 can be partitioned into L-1 decreasing sequences? But that is true by the theorem. However, the partition we have is fixed? But note: the same set might be partitioned in several ways.

Therefore, we are not counting the same set multiple times? 

Actually, no: because each set of chosen elements has a unique decomposition into decreasing sequences? No, the decomposition is not unique.

Therefore, this approach does not work for counting.

Another idea: the number of such subsets is the same as the number of antichains in the poset induced by F? But that is not true.

 I'm stuck.

 Let me look at the sample: F = {1,3,2} from the permutation [4,1,3,2]. The entire set F has 3 elements. The number of subsets of F that have LIS>=2 is the ones that contain at least one increasing subsequence of length 2. The increasing subsequences in F are:
   [1,3] and [1,2] (note: [3,2] is decreasing).

The subsets that have LIS=2 are:
   {1,3}, {1,2}, {3,2} -> LIS=2? 
      {3,2}: LIS=1? because 3 and 2 are in decreasing order? 
   Also, {1,3,2}: has [1,3] or [1,2] -> LIS=2.

But {3,2} has LIS=1, so it should not be counted. 

So the valid subsets are:
   {1,3} -> [1,3] (length 2)
   {1,2} -> [1,2] (length 2)
   {1,3,2} -> [1,3] or [1,2] (length 2)

And the empty set and singletons have LIS<=1.

Therefore, there are 3 subsets of F that have LIS=2.

And the number of subsets of F is 2^3 = 8, so the number of subsets with no increasing subsequence of length 2 is 5. 

Now, can we cover F with 1 decreasing sequence? because we want to avoid an increasing subsequence of length 2, then we would need to cover with L-1 = 1 decreasing sequence. But the set F is not a decreasing sequence: it has 1, then 3, then 2. The values are 1,3,2. This is not decreasing. The longest decreasing subsequence might be 2, but to cover with one decreasing sequence, we would need the entire set to be decreasing, which it is not.

But if we use two decreasing sequences, then we can cover: 
   sequence1: 1, 2   [because 1>2? no, 1<2, so not decreasing] -> not.

Actually, we can do:
   sequence1: 1, 3   -> but 1<3, not decreasing.
   sequence2: 2

Alternatively, we can do:
   sequence1: 3,2  (decreasing)
   sequence2: 1

This is a covering by two decreasing sequences. 

Then the number of subsets that avoid an increasing subsequence of length 2 is the number of ways to choose at most one element from each decreasing sequence: 
   from sequence1: we can choose {}, {3}, {2}, {3,2} -> 4 choices? 
   from sequence2: we can choose {} or {1} -> 2 choices.
   total = 4 * 2 = 8? 

But we only want 5. So that is not matching.

The catch: the two sequences are disjoint, so the set {1,3} is choosing 3 from sequence1 and 1 from sequence2, and {3} from sequence1 and {1} from sequence2 yields the set {1,3}. But {1,3} has an increasing subsequence of length 2, which is not allowed.

Therefore, we cannot use this product because it does not account for the interactions between the sequences.

The issue is that the sequences are not comparable overall? The element 1 (from sequence2) is before 3 (from sequence1) and 1<3, so they form an increasing subsequence.

So the method of covering by decreasing sequences does not give a direct product for the subsets because the sequences are not totally ordered in the poset.

Therefore, we must use a DP that goes in the order of the indices and maintains the state of the last elements of the L-1 decreasing sequences. 

The state: an increasing sequence of length L-1: (min_last, ..., max_last) for the L-1 decreasing sequences, where min_last is the smallest last element among the decreasing sequences, and so on. 

When we process an element x (which is the value at the current position), we can choose to skip it: then state unchanged.

If we choose to take it, then we must assign it to a decreasing sequence. The assignment: we find the smallest last element that is > x. Why? Because we want to attach x to a decreasing sequence, and the last element of the sequence must be > x to maintain the decreasing property. If there are multiple, we choose the one with the smallest last element? (greedily to leave the larger ones for future larger x). 

This is the classical "patience sorting" and the state is the array of the last elements of the sequences.

The state is an increasing sequence: c_1 <= c_2 <= ... <= c_{k} for k<=L-1.

When we add x, we find the smallest c_i > x, and replace c_i by x. If there is no such c_i, then we cannot include x without causing an increasing subsequence of length L? Actually, if we cannot assign x to any sequence, then we would have to open a new sequence, but we are only allowed L-1 sequences, so we cannot include x without exceeding the number of sequences, which would imply that the set including x has an increasing subsequence of length L.

Therefore, if we cannot assign x to any of the L-1 sequences, we cannot include x.

The state space: the state is a sorted sequence of at most L-1 integers (the last elements). The values are the values of the elements (between 1 and n), and L-1 is about 600. The number of states is the number of increasing sequences of length up to L-1. This is C(n, L-1) which is too large.

However, we are only (0.1 sec in the problem) and the permutation is random. In a random permutation, the state (the array of last elements) will be for each prefix the patience sorting state, and it is known that the expected length of the state is about 2*sqrt(n) and the state itself is a sequence of length about 2*sqrt(n) and the values are not too spread. Moreover, we only need to go over the elements of F, and |F| is the number of elements that are in some increasing subsequence of length L.

But note: in a random permutation, |F| is about O(n) and the state has length L-1=O(sqrt(n)), and the values in the state are distinct and increasing, but the number of states might be O(|F| * (number of states in the patience sorting) which is exponential.

Alternatively, we can use a Fenwick tree or segment tree to do the DP in state space? But the state is a tuple, not a scalar.

 There is a known solution for this problem: it is a typical problem in the 2015 ICPC final: 
   "Evolution in Parallel"
 and also the problem is similar to "avoiding the increasing subsequence of length L".

In fact, the generating function for the number of such sets is given by the hook-length formula for the etc? 

But after research in my mind, I recall that the problem has been solved by at least two ways:

1. Using a generating function and the RSK correspondence. The number is the sum over standard Young tableaux of a given shape. But the shape is the one from the LIS decomposition. This is heavy.

2. Using the following: the elements in F can be partitioned into L chains (in the sense of the longest increasing subsequence) and then the number of subsets with no increasing subsequence of length L is 0 if the set has an increasing subsequence of length L, but wait, no.

 Alternatively, there is a result: the number is the product over i of (1 + x_i) where the x_i are the hook-lengths? 

 Given the time, and that the permutation is random, we can use the following: 

   answer = (2^{n - |F|} * (2^{|F|} - (number of subsets of F with no increasing subsequence of length L))) 
            = 2^n - ( number of subsets of F with no increasing subsequence of length L) * 2^{n-|F|}

 So we only need to compute the number of subsets of F with no increasing subsequence of length L, and then multiply by 2^{n-|F|}. 

And the number of subsets of F with no increasing subsequence of length L can be computed by a DP with state = a sorted tuple of the last elements of L-1 decreasing sequences. The state is an array of length exactly L-1 (we can 0 for not used, but then we allow less than L-1? but then the state becomes not fixed length). 

We can do:

   Let L0 = L-1.
   We will maintain an array (tuple) state[0..L0-1] (0-indexed) of the last elements of the decreasing sequences, and we will keep it sorted: state[0] < state[1] < ... < state[L0-1] (if a sequence is not used, then we set state[i] = infinity).

   Initial state: (inf, inf, ..., inf).

   For each element x in F (in the order of increasing index in the original sequence, which is the natural order of the positions), we update the state:

      for each state, we can skip x: then state remains.

      or take x: then find the smallest index i such that state[i] > x. If found, then we set state[i] = x. If not found, then we cannot take x.

   The number of states might be large, but note that the state is an array of L0 integers, and in a random permutation, the state does not have too many distinct states. In fact, the state is the same as the patience sorting state, and it is known that the state changes in at most one position per item, and the states are increasing sequences. The total number of states is the number of increasing sequences of length L0, but we can't iterate over all of them.

 However, there is a DP optimization: using a map for the state. The state can be represented as a tuple, and we use a map. The question is: how many states will we have? 

 In the worst-case, the number of states is exponential in L0, which is sqrt(n), so about 2^( sqrt(n) ) which for n=100,000, sqrt(n)~316, and 2^316 is astronomical.

Therefore, we need a more efficient method.

 There is a known solution for the problem "count the number of subsets of a permutation that avoid an increasing subsequence of length L" using a exponential in L0 dynamic programming on the value of the state, and note that the state is an increasing sequence of length L0, and the next element x will only change one position in the state. Moreover, the state can be represented as a sorted array. And there is a     

But in a random permutation, the number of states is O(n) or O(n^{L0})? This is not clear.

 Alternatively, we can use the following: 

   recent research has shown that for random permutations, the number of states in the patience sorting is O(exp(sqrt(n))) and not practical.

 I recall a better approach: 

   We can use generating functions and the fact that the set F has a specific structure: it is a union of LIS of length L, and in fact, the set F can be partitioned into L sets S_1, S_2, ..., S_L, where S_i is the set of elements that have f(i) = i. Then within each S_i, the elements are in decreasing order (by index or by value?).

 In the decomposition:

   Let’s define:

        for each k from 1 to L, let level k be the set of elements i such that f(i) = k.

   Then, within each level, the elements (by index) are in increasing order of index, and the values are in decreasing order. Why? Because if two elements in the same level, say i and j with i<j, then if a[i] < a[j], we could have an increasing subsequence ending at i of length k and then extend it to j, so f(j)>=k+1, which is a contradiction. Therefore, in the same level, if i<j then a[i] > a[j]. So each level is a decreasing sequence.

   Moreover, an increasing subsequence of length L must use exactly one element from each level.

   Therefore, the set F is partitioned into L levels, and each level is a decreasing sequence.

   Now, we want to count the number of subsets of F that contain no increasing subsequence of forbonately
   of length L. But note: any increasing subsequence can use at most one element from each level. Therefore, an increasing subsequence of length L would require one element from each level, and the values must be increasing across levels.

   Therefore, the condition for a subset to have an increasing subsequence of length L is that it contains at least one L-tuple of elements (x_1, x_2, ..., x_L) with x_i in level i and x_1.value < x_2.value < ... < x_L.value.

   Moreover, the entire set F has such a tuple (because it has an increasing subsequence of length L).

   Now, the number of subsets of F that avoid an increasing subsequence of length L is the number of subsets that avoid any such L-tuple.

   This is a hitting-set like problem, but in levels.

   Specifically, the condition is: the subset must avoid to contain any chain (in the value order) that has one element from each level.

   This is a typical problem in combinatorial that can be solved by a DP that goes level by level and does a convolution. 

   The levels are:

        level 1: a set of elements, sorted in decreasing order of values (or increasing order of index) 
        level 2: similarly
        ...
        level L: similarly

   and the condition is: we cannot pick a sequence of elements one from each level that has strictly increasing values.

   Then, the number of ways to choose a subset of F that contains no such chain is the number of antichains in this L-partite order? or independent sets in the comparison graph between levels.

   In fact, the condition between levels is: we can only pick a subset such that for any two elements in consecutive levels, if we pick one in level i and one in level i+1, then the value in level i must be >= the value in level i+1.

   But wait, not necessarily: the levels are not necessarily consecutive in the increasing subsequence. The chain can jump: the only requirement is that the values are increasing.

   However, because of the decomposition, if we have an element in level i and an element in level j>i, then if the element in level i has value < the element in level j, then they can potentially form a chain (if they are not blocked by other elements).

   Therefore, the condition is: the set should not contain any chain of length L.

   And this is a graded poset of L levels.

   Then, the number of such independent sets (that avoid a chain of length L) can be computed by a DP that processes the levels and for each level, and for each value, we do:

        dp[i][ mask] = ...

   but the levels might have up to O(n) elements, and L is about 600, so we cannot iterate over masks.

   Alternatively, we can use a sweep over the values. The values are from 1 to n, and the entire set F has at most n elements.

   We can do:

        dp[i] = the number of ways to choose elements from the levels such that the maximum chain length is at most ? and we haven't chosen any chain of length L.

   But we only care about avoiding a chain of length L.

   We can use a DP that goes value by value (from 1 to n) and for each value, if it is in F, then it belongs to a level, say f. Then, if we choose it, then we cannot choose any element in level > f that has a value > this value and that would complete a chain of length L? 

   This is complicated.

   Alternatively, we can use inclusion-ex over the chains: 

        number of subsets = sum_{k>=0} (-1)^k * (number of ways to choose k disjoint chains of length L? )

   This is also complicated.

  Given the complexity, I recall that there is a known solution for this problem in the (for the entire sequence) for the number of ways to have a subsequence with LIS exactly L, and it uses the following:

        ans = (number of increasing subsequences of length L) * 2^{n - ?} 

  but it is not that simple.

  After research in memory, I recall that a recent solution for this exact problem (from a contest) uses the following:

        Compute the set F.
        Within F, for each element i, let f(i) = the level in the LIS ending at i (as above).
        Then, for each value v, let we know the level of the element with value v.

        Then, the condition for a subset to have no increasing subsequence of length L is that it is a union of at most L-1 sets, where each set is an antichain. But in this graded poset, an antichain is a set with no two elements in the same level? no, because in the same level, they are not comparable, but in different levels, they might be comparable.

        Actually, the poset is a (possibly disconnected) union of L levels, and comparable only between different levels and if the value in a lower level is less than the value in a higher level.

        Then, by Dilworth's theorem, the size of the largest chain is the minimum number of antichains needed to cover the poset. But we want to avoid a chain of length L, which means the largest chain is at most L-1, so the poset can be partitioned into L-1 antichains.

        Then, the number of subsets that avoid a chain of length L is the number of ways to color the elements with L-1 colors such that in any chain the colors are distinct? and then take any subset of each color class? This is not directly giving a product.

  Given the complexity and the constraints, and that the permutation is random, there is a known solution in O(n* (L^2)) or O(n*L*log n) for the entire sequence. In fact, we can use the following: 

        Let's build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) on F: edge from i to j if i has level = l, j has level = l+1, and a[i] < a[j], and i appears before j.

        Then, a chain of length L is a path of length L (L vertices). We want the number of subsets that avoid any path of length L.

        This is #independent set in a directed path graph of length L? but the graph is not a path, it's an arbitrary DAG.

        This is hard.

  I found a paper: "Count of the number of subsets of a permutation that avoid an increasing subsequence of length k" -> not found.

  Given the time, I think the intended solution is to use the following:

      In the set F, the elements are partitioned into levels as described. Then, the number of subsets of F that have no increasing subsequence of length L is equal to the product over the levels of (1 + x_i) where x_i is the number of elements in the level, but this is not true because of the across-level constraints.

      Alternatively, we can use a DP that processes the levels from 1 to L, and for each level, we maintain the minimum value of the elements chosen in the level for the last etc. 

      Specifically, for level i, the elements are sorted in decreasing order of value. When we choose a subset in level i, the only constraint is that for any two consecutive levels, the values in level i must be > the values in level i+1? why? Because if in the subset we have an element in level i with value v and an element in level i+1 with value w, and v < w, then they can be part of an increasing subsequence (and potentially part of a chain of length L).

      Actually, to avoid a chain of length L, we must avoid any increasing sequence across the levels. In particular, if in level i we choose an element with value v and in level i+1 we choose an element with value w and v < w, then this might be part of a chain. But note: a chain of length L requires L elements in increasing order of value and in increasing order of level. So to avoid any chain of length L, it is sufficient to ensure that in the subset, for each i, the values in level i are >= the values in level i+1. (Then, any chain within the subset will have the property that the value in level i >= the value in level i+1, so it cannot be increasing across levels.)

      Therefore, the condition is: the subset must be such that the value of any chosen element in level i is >= the value of any chosen element in level i+1.

      Then, we can do a DP that goes level by level (from level 1 to level L) and for each level, we know the elements in sorted order (by value, which is decreasing as we within level i, the elements are in decreasing order of value). 

      Let the levels be: level1, level2, ..., levelL.

      For level1, we can any subset.

      For level2, we can any subset, but the minimum value in level2 must be >= the maximum value in level1? Not exactly: condition is: for every element in level2, it must be >= every element in level1? No: condition is: for every chosen element in level2, it must be >= every chosen element in level1? wait, no: the condition is that if we have an element a in level1 and an element b in level2, then a>=b. 
        Because if a< b, then (a,b) would be an increasing subsequence of length 2, and if we have more levels, it might be part of a chain of length L.

      Therefore, the condition is: the set of chosen values in level1 should be >= the set of chosen values in level2, and level2>=level3, and so on.

      In other words, if we let m_i = the minimum chosen value in level i, and M_i = the maximum chosen value in level i, then we require that M_1 >= m_2, and M_2 >= m_3, ... 

      but this is not sufficient: because we might have in level1: [5, 3] ( values) and in level2: [4, 2]. If we choose 3 in level1 and 4 in level2, then 3<4, which is not allowed.

      Therefore, the condition is: every chosen element in level i+1 must be >= every chosen element in level i? No, that is not necessary. In fact, we only require that there is no increasing pair between level i and level i+1. So if we have a in level i and b in level i+1 with a < b, then it is not allowed.

      This is equivalent to: the set of chosen for level i and level i+1 together should have no increasing pair (a from level i, b from level i+1) with a < b.

      This is also equivalent to: the chosen set in level i is >= the chosen set in level i+1? not exactly, because we might have a in level i and b in level i+1 with a< b even if the minimum in level i is>= the maximum in level i+1. 

      Example: level i: [5,3], level i+1: [4,2]. If we choose 3 from level i and 4 from level i+1, then 3<4 -> not allowed.
              even though the minimum in level i (3) < the maximum in level i+1 (4).

      Therefore, the condition is pairwise: for every chosen a in level i and chosen b in level i+1, we require a>=b.

      This is a for every pair, which means that the entire set in level i+1 must be <= the entire set in level i. 

      So if we let x = the minimum chosen value in level i, and y = the maximum chosen value in level i+1, then we require y <= x.

      But note: it is also sufficient, because if the maximum in level i+1 is <= the minimum in level i, then any a in level i+1 is <= any b in level i.

      Therefore, the condition for between level i and level i+1 is: the maximum chosen value in level i+1 <= the minimum chosen value in level i.

      So we can do a DP with state: (i, min_i, max_{i+1}} but this is too heavy.

      Alternatively, we can use a DP that goes level by level and maintains only one number: the minimum value in the current level's chosen set. 

      Why? Because for the next level, we will need that the maximum value in the next level is <= this minimum.

      But wait, for the next level (level i+1), we will then have to aggregate based on the minimum value in level i+1 for the next next level. 

      Specifically, let dp[i][m] = the number of ways to choose subsets for levels 1..i such that the minimum chosen value in level i is m, and the choices for levels 1..i are valid.

      How to compute dp[i+1][m'] from dp[i][m]? 

        for level i+1, we are given the sorted list of values (in increasing order? or decreasing) -> within level i+1, the values are in decreasing order of value ( because in the level, the indices increase and values decrease). 

        Let the values in level i+1 be: [v_1, v_2, ..., v_k] with v_1 > v_2 > ... > v_k.

        We want to choose a subset of these values. The condition: the maximum value in this subset must be <= the minimum value in the previous level's chosen set (m) because the condition between level i and i+1 is: values in level i+1 must be <= values in level i, and the minimum in level i is m, so the maximum in level i+1 must be<=m.

        Also, for the next level (i+2), we will need the minimum value in level i+1's chosen set.

        Therefore, if we let the chosen set in level i+1 be some values, then the minimum value in the chosen set in level i+1 is the smallest value chosen.

        So for a fixed level i+1, we can iterate over the possible choices that have maximum value <= m, and for a particular choice, the minimum value in the chosen set is the smallest value in the chosen set.

        Then, we can do:

           for each m in [1, n] (state for level i), 
              for each possible nonempty subset of level i+1 that has only values <= m, and then for the subset, let the minimum value be the smallest value in the subset.

        But also, we can choose the empty set in level i+1. Then the state for level i+1 is not defined. But then for level i+2, we will need the minimum in level i+1, but level i+1 has no element chosen. So we would have to carry a state for "no element chosen" in level i+1. 

        This becomes complex.

      Given the complexity, and that the levels are to be from 1 to L, and L is about 600, and the values in each level can be up to O(n), we cannot do O(n^2) per level.

      We can use a Fenwick tree or segment tree to aggregate the DP for the next level.

      Specifically, for level i+1, let the values be sorted in decreasing order: v_1 > v_2 > ... > v_k.
        We want to compute for each possible m' (which will be the minimum value in the chosen set for level i+1), the number of ways to choose a subset of level i+1 that has:
            - all values <= m (from the state of level i)
            - and the minimum value is m'.

        But note: the condition for the next level (i+2) only cares about the minimum value in level i+1, so we only need to aggregate by the minimum value.

        Also, we can choose any subset as long as the maximum value in the subset is<= m.

        The number of ways to choose a subset from level i+1 with minimum = m' and maximum<= m is: consider only values in the range [m', m] (and within the level i+1). 

        But the values in level i+1 are distinct and sorted in decreasing order. 

        Let the values in level i+1 that are in [m', m] be: we can index by the value.

        The number of ways to choose a subset of these values that has minimum exactly m' is: 
            2^{count of values in [m'+1, m]} if we force to include at least one m' and then any subset of values in (m', m].

        Specifically, if we let:
            count = number of values in level i+1 that are in [m', m]
            count_above = number of values in [m'+1, m]

        then the number of ways that include at least one m' and have minimum = m' is: 
            2^{count_above}   [because we must choose at least one m', and the count_above values can be chosen arbitrarily] 
            but wait, there might be several m'? The values are distinct.

        Actually, there is exactly one element with value = m' (because distinct).

        Therefore, the number of ways to choose a subset with minimum = m' and maximum<= m is:
            1 * ( ways to choose any subset of the values in [m'+1, m] ) = 2^{count_above}

        However, if there is no element with value = m', then it is 0.

        But also, we can choose the empty set. How to handle empty set for the level? 

        If we choose the empty set for level i+1, then the state for the next level (i+2) will be the state of level i? or we have to continue with level i+1 being empty.

        We design: 

          We.
