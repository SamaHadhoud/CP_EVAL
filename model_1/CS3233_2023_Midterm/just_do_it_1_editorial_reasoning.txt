We are to compute the sum over all contiguous subarrays of (min * max) for the subarray.
That is, for every contiguous subarray [i, j], we compute:
   min_ij = min(a[i..j])
   max_ij = max(a[i..j])
and then add min_ij * max_ij for all such subarrays.

Directly iterating over all O(n^2) subarrays is too slow for n up to 300,000.

Instead, we can use a common technique: use stacks to compute the "contribution" of each element as the min or max in a set of subarrays. However, note that here we have both min and max multiplied together. 

Alternatively, we can split the problem:

Consider that the expression is:
   Sum_{i<=j} [min(i,j) * max(i,j)]

We can use the idea of processing the array by considering each element as the minimum (or maximum) and then using the known left and right boundaries. But note that the product of min and max complicates matters.

Another idea: use a divide and conquer approach? But with n=300000, we need O(n log n) or better.

Alternatively, we can use a known identity:

Note that for any set of numbers, we have:
   min * max = (min + max)^2 - min^2 - max^2 - 2 * min * max?  -> No, that doesn't hold.

Actually, we have:
   (min + max)^2 = min^2 + max^2 + 2*min*max
So: 
   min*max = [(min+max)^2 - min^2 - max^2] / 2

But that doesn't seem immediately helpful because we are summing over subarrays.

Alternatively, we can expand the product:

   Sum_{subarray} (min * max) = 
        Sum_{subarray} [ (min+max)^2 - min^2 - max^2 ] / 2   -> but wait, that is not an identity for the product.

Actually, we have:
   min * max = [ (min+max)^2 - (min^2 + max^2) ] / 2   is incorrect. 

Let me check: 
   (min+max)^2 = min^2 + max^2 + 2*min*max
   => min*max = [ (min+max)^2 - (min^2+max^2) ] / 2

Yes, that is correct. So we can write:

   Total = Sum_{subarray} min*max 
          = (1/2) * [ Sum_{subarray} (min+max)^2 - Sum_{subarray} (min^2) - Sum_{subarray} (max^2) ]

But note: the expression above is not linear. Actually, it is linear? We are just breaking the product. However, observe:

   We have three separate sums: 
      S1 = Sum_{subarray} (min+max)^2
      S2 = Sum_{subarray} min^2
      S3 = Sum_{subarray} max^2

But note: (min+max)^2 is not the same as min^2 + max^2. Actually, (min+max)^2 = min^2 + max^2 + 2*min*max.

So then:

   Total = (1/2) * [ S1 - S2 - S3 ]

But then S1 = Sum (min+max)^2 = Sum (min^2 + max^2 + 2*min*max) = S2 + S3 + 2 * Total

Therefore:

   Total = (1/2) * [ (S2+S3+2*Total) - S2 - S3 ] 
          = (1/2) * (2*Total) 
          = Total

Which is circular. So that identity does not help.

We need a different approach.

Alternative approach:

We can use the technique of "expanding the contribution" of each subarray by processing the array with a stack to compute the left and right boundaries for each element as the minimum and similarly as the maximum. However, the product of min and max in the same subarray is challenging.

Another idea: use the fact that the product min*max is multiplicative? Not exactly.

We can try to use a two-pointer or a stack that simultaneously tracks min and max? That seems complex.

Alternatively, we can use a known technique: "contribution technique" for both min and max simultaneously? 

Actually, note that:

   Sum_{subarray} min*max = 
        Sum_{i} a_i * [ number of subarrays where a_i is the minimum and a_j is the maximum? ] ... not exactly.

But wait, we can break the product by linearity? Not directly.

Alternatively, we can use the following:

Consider each pair of indices (i, j) with i<=j. How many subarrays [L, R] are such that the min is a_i and the max is a_j? Then we could add a_i * a_j multiplied by the count.

But the condition is: the subarray must contain both a_i and a_j, and a_i must be the minimum and a_j the maximum. Moreover, if i=j, then we have a single element. But note that the min and max are defined over the entire subarray.

However, the min and max might not be at positions i and j. So we need to fix the entire subarray.

This approach might be O(n^2) in the worst case.

Alternatively, we can use a known identity:

   Sum_{subarray} min * max = 
        Sum_{subarray} min * max 
        = (1/4) * [ (min+max)^2 - (min-max)^2 ] 
        = (1/4) * [ (min+max)^2 - (max-min)^2 ] 
   but note: (min+max)^2 - (min-max)^2 = 4*min*max.

But again, that doesn't help because we are summing.

So we are stuck with the direct computation.

Let me recall: there is a known problem: sum over subarrays of min*max? 

Actually, we can use a D&C or a stack-based method that expands the array by adding one element at a time and maintaining the min and max for the subarrays ending at the current index. However, the min and max are not independent and the product is nonlinear.

We can use a segment tree? But we need to combine the information.

Alternatively, we can use a technique similar to "largest rectangle in a histogram" for both min and max? 

Here is a known approach:

We can use two stacks to compute for each element the boundaries for which it is the minimum and similarly for the maximum. Then we can compute the total sum of min over all subarrays and similarly for max. But here we need the product.

But note: we cannot separate min and max because they are multiplied.

Another idea: use monotonic stacks to compute the contribution of each element as the minimum and as the maximum, and then combine? But how?

Alternatively, we can use a sweep-line and maintain a data structure that tracks the current min and max for subarrays ending at the current index.

We traverse j from 1 to n, and consider all subarrays ending at j.

Let:
   min_i = min(a_i, a_{i+1}, ..., a_j)
   max_i = max(a_i, a_{i+1}, ..., a_j)

Then we need to compute: 
   S = sum_{i=1}^{j} min_i * max_i

And then we sum S for j from 1 to n.

But how to update when we add a new element a_j?

We note that the sequences min_i (for fixed j and i from 1 to j) and max_i are non-increasing and non-decreasing? Actually, as i increases, min_i is non-decreasing? 

Wait: as i increases (from 1 to j), the subarray [i, j] becomes smaller. Therefore, the min of [i, j] is non-decreasing as i increases? Actually, no: consider [1,3,2] and j=3: 
   i=1: [1,3,2] -> min=1
   i=2: [3,2] -> min=2 -> wait, that's not non-decreasing.

Actually, as we move i from left to right (increasing i), the subarray [i, j] loses the leftmost element. So the min can either increase or stay the same? Actually, it can only increase or stay the same? Similarly, the max can only decrease or stay the same? 

So:
   min_i: as i increases (from 1 to j), min_i is non-decreasing.
   max_i: as i increases (from 1 to j), max_i is non-increasing.

Therefore, the sequences min_i and max_i are monotonic. So we can break the interval [1, j] into segments where min_i is constant and max_i is constant? Actually, we can break into segments for constant min and constant max? But note they are independent.

We can use two stacks: one for the min and one for the max. 

Specifically, we maintain two stacks for the min and max, and then we can break [1, j] into O(j) segments? Actually, we can break into segments that are constant for both min and max? That might be too many.

Alternatively, we can break the array into segments that are constant for min and segments that are constant for max independently. However, the product complicates.

But note: the min_i and max_i are independent. We can use the following:

We maintain two arrays: 
   min_val[i] = min(a_i, a_{i+1}, ..., a_j) for each i (for the current j)
   max_val[i] = max(a_i, a_{i+1}, ..., a_j) for each i.

When we add a_j, we update:

   For min: we know that min_val[i] for i from k to j is updated to a_j? Actually, we can use a stack to update the min: we traverse backwards and while the current a_j is less than the last min, we merge.

Similarly for max.

But we need to update the entire array? That would be O(j) per j -> O(n^2).

We need a more efficient way.

We can store:
   min_val[i] for i in [1, j] is non-decreasing. Similarly, max_val[i] is non-increasing.

We also note that the changes in min_val and max_val happen at indices that we can track with a stack. Specifically:

   We maintain a stack for min: the stack will store (index, value) such that the min_val is constant over segments. Similarly for max.

But now, we want to update the entire product array: 
   We have for each i: min_val[i] * max_val[i], and we want the sum over i.

We can maintain a segment tree that supports range assignments and range queries? 

Specifically, when we add a_j:

   Step 1: Update the min_val for a contiguous segment [L_min, j] to a_j (if a_j is smaller than the previous min in that segment). Similarly, update the max_val for a contiguous segment [L_max, j] to a_j (if a_j is larger than the previous max in that segment).

   Then we need to update the segment tree for the product: 
        We have two lazy updates: one for min and one for max. But note: the update for min and max are independent and might update different segments.

However, the problem is that a segment of the array [1, j] is partitioned by both the min segments and the max segments. So we have to update two different sets of segments. Moreover, the two updates might not align.

This becomes messy.

Alternatively, we can maintain the entire array as a collection of segments that are constant in both min and max? But the segments would be the intersections of the min segments and the max segments, and there might be O(j) segments per j.

Total complexity would be O(n^2).

We need a simpler idea.

Known solution: 

There is a known solution for this problem: using Cartesian tree and D&C, or using a stack to maintain the min and max and then use a segment tree to update the products. But a more efficient method is to use a stack and a Fenwick tree? 

Alternatively, we can use a method that expands the array and maintains the following:

   Let F(j) = sum_{i=1}^{j} min_i * max_i.

   We know F(j) from F(j-1) and update the last element.

   We also know that the min_val and max_val for i from 1 to j-1 might change when we add a_j? Only the min_val for some i's might change to a_j (if a_j is smaller) and similarly for the max_val.

   Specifically, we can update the min_val for i in [p+1, j] to a_j, where p is the last index where a_p < a_j (for min). Similarly for max: we update i in [q+1, j] to a_j, where q is the last index where a_q > a_j.

   So the array min_val[1..j] is updated as follows: 
        min_val[i] for i in [p+1, j] = a_j, and for i in [1, p] remains unchanged.

   Similarly, max_val[i] for i in [q+1, j] = a_j, and for i in [1, q] remains unchanged.

   Then F(j) = F(j-1) - (the old products for i in [p+1, j-1] and [q+1, j-1]) + (the new products for i in [p+1, j] and [q+1, j])? 

   But note: the update for min and max are independent and the segment [p+1, j] and [q+1, j] might overlap arbitrarily.

   We have to break the interval [1, j] into three parts:

        Part 1: [1, min(p,q)]   -> neither min nor max updated
        Part 2: [min(p,q)+1, max(p,q)] -> either min or max updated (but not both)
        Part 3: [max(p,q)+1, j]   -> both min and max updated

   But actually, the update for min is for [p+1, j] and the update for max is for [q+1, j]. So we have:

        Segment 1: [1, min(p,q)]: no update -> the product remains.
        Segment 2: [min(p,q)+1, max(p,q)]: 
            If p < q: then segment [p+1, q]: min_val updated to a_j, but max_val not updated (because q+1 hasn't been reached for the max update) -> so the product becomes: a_j * (old max_val[i])
            If q < p: then segment [q+1, p]: max_val updated to a_j, but min_val not updated -> becomes (old min_val[i]) * a_j
        Segment 3: [max(p,q)+1, j]: both updated -> becomes a_j * a_j.

   But note: in the segment [max(p,q)+1, j] we set both min and max to a_j? Actually, yes: because a_j is the smallest in [p+1, j] (so for i in [p+1, j] the min is a_j) and similarly for max.

   However, we must also note that the entire segment [1, j] is updated for the new element a_j? Actually, we are updating only the segments that become min a_j and max a_j.

   Also, for the new index j: we have a new term: min_val[j] = a_j, max_val[j] = a_j, so product = a_j^2.

   But in the update above, we are including j in segment 3.

   Therefore, we can compute:

        F(j) = F0   (where F0 is F(j-1) but without the j-th element? Actually, no: F(j) is defined for i from 1 to j, while F(j-1) is for 1 to j-1. So we have to account for the new term at j and the changes to the terms from 1 to j-1.

   Actually, we can compute:

        F(j) = F(j-1) [which is the sum for i=1 to j-1 for the state at j-1] 
                + a_j * a_j   [for the subarray [j,j]]
                + [update for the segment that gets min updated: [p+1, j-1] and the segment that gets max updated: [q+1, j-1] and the overlap]

   However, the update for i in [1, j-1] is: we change the min_val for [p+1, j-1] to a_j and the max_val for [q+1, j-1] to a_j.

   Therefore, the change for an index i in [p+1, j-1] is: 
        new_product_i = (a_j) * (max_val[i] at j-1)   [if only min is updated] 
        but if i is also in [q+1, j-1], then we also update the max to a_j, so new_product_i = a_j * a_j.

   Similarly, for an index i in [q+1, j-1] but not in [p+1, j-1]: new_product_i = (min_val[i] at j-1) * a_j.

   But note: the segment [p+1, j-1] and [q+1, j-1] are independent. We can break [1, j-1] into three segments:

        Let L = min(p,q)+1, R = max(p,q)   [if p and q are the boundaries]

        Segment A: [p+1, q] if p<q, or [q+1, p] if q<p: but actually we need to consider the intervals:

        We have two intervals: 
            I_min = [p+1, j-1]   (to be updated for min)
            I_max = [q+1, j-1]   (to be updated for max)

        Then the sets:
            Only min updated: I_min - I_max = [p+1, min(q, j-1)] if p+1<=min(q, j-1) and then [min(q, j-1)+1, j-1] might be in the overlap? Actually, we can split:

        Alternatively, we can compute the change by:

            Change = (new_product_i - old_product_i) for each i.

        We can break [1, j-1] into three disjoint parts:

            Part1: [1, min(p,q)]: no change.
            Part2: [min(p,q)+1, max(p,q)]: 
                   If p < q: then this part is [p+1, q]: we update the min to a_j, but the max remains the same as at j-1.
                   If q < p: then this part is [q+1, p]: we update the max to a_j, but the min remains the same.
            Part3: [max(p,q)+1, j-1]: both min and max are updated to a_j.

        And then we also have the new term at j: a_j^2.

        Therefore:

            F(j) = F(j-1) 
                   + a_j^2   [for i=j]
                   + (sum over i in [p+1, min(q, j-1)] of [a_j * (max_val_old[i]) - (min_val_old[i] * max_val_old[i])]   for the case p<q? 
                   But wait, we have to account for both cases.

        Actually, we can write:

            Let L1 = p+1, R1 = j-1   for the min update interval.
            Let L2 = q+1, R2 = j-1   for the max update interval.

            Then the entire update for i in [1, j-1] can be done by:

                F(j) = F(j-1) 
                       - (sum over i in [L1, R1] of min_val_old[i] * max_val_old[i])
                       - (sum over i in [L2, R2] of min_val_old[i] * max_val_old[i]) 
                       + (sum over i in [L1, R1] of a_j * max_val_old[i])
                       + (sum over i in [L2, R2] of min_val_old[i] * a_j)
                       - (sum over i in [L1 ∩ L2, R1 ∩ R2] of min_val_old[i] * max_val_old[i]) ??? 

        This is messy because we have subtracted the overlap twice and then we have to add the new product for the overlap: but the new product for the overlap is a_j * a_j, and we are going to add a_j * max_val_old for the min-update and min_val_old * a_j for the max-update, which for the overlap would be: a_j * (max_val_old[i]) + a_j * (min_val_old[i]) - (min_val_old[i] * max_val_old[i])? 

        Actually, we are updating the entire min-update interval to have min_val = a_j, and the entire max-update interval to have max_val = a_j. And the overlap is updated to both.

        So the new product for an index i is:
            If only min updated: product = a_j * max_val_old[i]
            If only max updated: product = min_val_old[i] * a_j
            If both: product = a_j * a_j

        How to compute the change? 

            Change_i = 
                If i is in min-update only: (a_j * max_val_old[i]) - (min_val_old[i] * max_val_old[i])
                If i is in max-update only: (min_val_old[i] * a_j) - (min_val_old[i] * max_val_old[i])
                If i is in both: (a_j * a_j) - (min_val_old[i] * max_val_old[i])

        Then the total change for [1, j-1] is:

            = (sum_{i in min-update only} [a_j * max_val_old[i] - min_val_old[i] * max_val_old[i]])
              + (sum_{i in max-update only} [min_val_old[i] * a_j - min_val_old[i] * max_val_old[i]])
              + (sum_{i in both} [a_j^2 - min_val_old[i] * max_val_old[i]])

        And we add a_j^2 for i=j.

        But note: the sets "min-update only", "max-update only", and "both" form a partition of [p+1, j-1] ∪ [q+1, j-1]? Actually, the entire update region is the union of the min-update interval and the max-update interval. And we can split the union into:

            min-update only = [p+1, j-1] \ [q+1, j-1] = [p+1, min(q, j-1)]   if p+1<=min(q, j-1) and then [min(q, j-1)+1, j-1] is the overlap? Actually, if we assume p<q, then:

                min-update only: [p+1, q]   (if q <= j-1) and the overlap is [q+1, j-1] (if q+1<=j-1).

            Similarly, if q < p, then:

                max-update only: [q+1, p]   (if p<=j-1) and the overlap is [p+1, j-1] (if p+1<=j-1).

        And if p>=j-1 or q>=j-1, then one of the intervals is empty.

        Therefore, we can compute:

            Let L_min = p+1, R_min = j-1   [min update interval]
            Let L_max = q+1, R_max = j-1   [max update interval]

            Then:
                both_interval = [max(L_min, L_max), min(R_min, R_max)]   if non-empty.

            Then:

                min_only_interval = [L_min, min(L_max-1, R_min)]   if L_min<=min(L_max-1, R_min)
                max_only_interval = [L_max, min(L_min-1, R_max)]   if L_max<=min(L_min-1, R_max)   -> but note: if L_min > L_max, then min_only_interval might be empty and max_only_interval is [L_max, L_min-1] and then both is [L_min, R_min] ∩ [L_max, R_max] = [L_min, min(R_min, R_max)]? 

        Actually, a simpler way is:

            We have three intervals:

            Interval for min: [L1, R1] = [p+1, j-1]
            Interval for max: [L2, R2] = [q+1, j-1]

            Then:

                min_only = [L1, min(R1, L2-1)]   [if L2 > L1, then this is from L1 to L2-1, otherwise empty?]

            But wait: if L1 < L2, then [L1, L2-1] is min_only, and [L2, R1] (if L2<=R1) is the both part? 
            But then the max_only part: [L2, R2] \ [L1, R1] = [max(L2, R1+1), R2]? 

        Alternatively, we can compute the change for the entire min interval and the entire max interval separately, and then subtract the double counted part? 

        Actually, the change for an index i in the min interval is: 
            new_product_i = 
                if i is also in the max interval: a_j^2
                else: a_j * max_val_old[i]

            Similarly, the change for an index i in the max interval is:
                if i is also in the min interval: a_j^2
                else: min_val_old[i] * a_j

        But if we do:

            Change = 
                (sum_{i in min_interval} [ (if i in max_interval then a_j^2 else a_j * max_val_old[i]) - (min_val_old[i] * max_val_old[i]) ])
                + (sum_{i in max_interval and not in min_interval} [ (min_val_old[i] * a_j) - (min_val_old[i] * max_val_old[i]) - (already subtracted in min_interval?)])

        This is messy.

        Instead, we can write the change for an index i as:

            If i is in min_interval and in max_interval: 
                new = a_j^2, old = old_min * old_max, so change = a_j^2 - old_min*old_max.

            If i is in min_interval only: 
                new = a_j * old_max, change = a_j * old_max - old_min*old_max.

            If i is in max_interval only:
                new = old_min * a_j, change = old_min * a_j - old_min*old_max.

        Then the total change is:

            = sum_{i in min_interval only} (a_j * old_max - old_min*old_max)
              + sum_{i in max_interval only} (old_min * a_j - old_min*old_max)
              + sum_{i in both} (a_j^2 - old_min*old_max)

        = a_j * (sum_{i in min_interval only} old_max + sum_{i in max_interval only} old_min)
          + a_j^2 * |both_interval|
          - (sum_{i in min_interval ∪ max_interval} (old_min * old_max))

        Now, note that min_interval ∪ max_interval = [min(L1,L2), max(R1,R2)]? Actually, the union is [min(p+1, q+1), j-1]? 

        But we can compute the three parts:

            min_interval = [p+1, j-1] -> length = (j-1) - (p+1) + 1 = j - p - 1
            max_interval = [q+1, j-1] -> length = j - q - 1
            both_interval = [max(p+1, q+1), j-1] -> length = j - 1 - max(p,q) 

            Then:
                min_interval only = (j - p - 1) - (both_interval length)
                max_interval only = (j - q - 1) - (both_interval length)

        But we also need the sums: 
            S_min_only = sum_{i in min_interval only} old_max[i]
            S_max_only = sum_{i in max_interval only} old_min[i]
            S_both = |both_interval|   (we don't need the sum of old_min*old_max for the entire union? because we have to subtract the entire product over the union)

        However, we also need the entire product sum over the union: 
            T = sum_{i in [min_interval ∪ max_interval]} (old_min[i] * old_max[i])

        Then the change is:

            = a_j * (S_min_only + S_max_only) 
              + a_j^2 * |both_interval|
              - T

        But we also have to account for the new term at j: a_j^2.

        Therefore:

            F(j) = F(j-1) + a_j^2 
                   + a_j * (S_min_only + S_max_only) 
                   + a_j^2 * |both_interval|
                   - T

        However, we have to compute:

            S_min_only = sum_{i in min_interval only} old_max[i] = sum_{i in [p+1, min(q, j-1)]} old_max[i]   (if p<q) 
            but note: if p>=q, then the min_interval only is empty.

        Similarly, S_max_only = sum_{i in max_interval only} old_min[i] = sum_{i in [q+1, min(p, j-1)]} old_min[i]   (if q<p) 

        But wait, the min_interval only is [p+1, min(q, j-1)] only when p<q? Actually, if p<q, then the min_interval is [p+1, j-1] and the max_interval is [q+1, j-1]. Then the min_interval only is [p+1, q] (if q<=j-1) and the both is [q+1, j-1]. 

        So:

            If p < q:
                min_interval only = [p+1, q]   (if q<=j-1) or [p+1, j-1] if q>j-1? but q is an index < j? so q<=j-1? 
                Actually, q is the last index with a value > a_j? so q is in [0, j-1]. So if p<q, then q is at most j-1.

                Then min_interval only = [p+1, q] -> length = q - p
                both_interval = [q+1, j-1] -> length = j-1 - q

            If q < p:
                max_interval only = [q+1, p] -> length = p - q
                both_interval = [p+1, j-1] -> length = j-1 - p

            If p==q, then both_interval = [p+1, j-1] and min_interval only and max_interval only are empty.

        Then:

            S_min_only = 
                if p < q: sum_{i=p+1}^{q} old_max[i]   [which is the max_val at state j-1 for i from p+1 to q]
            S_max_only = 
                if q < p: sum_{i=q+1}^{p} old_min[i]   [which is the min_val at state j-1 for i from q+1 to p]

            T = sum_{i in [min_interval ∪ max_interval]} (old_min[i] * old_max[i]) 
                = sum_{i in [min(p+1, q+1), j-1]} (min_val_old[i] * max_val_old[i])

        But note: the entire union is the entire interval [min(p+1, q+1), j-1]? Actually, the union is [min(p+1, q+1), j-1]? 

        Actually, the min_interval is [p+1, j-1] and the max_interval is [q+1, j-1]. The union is [min(p+1, q+1), j-1]? 

        However, if p+1 and q+1 are different, the union is the entire interval from the smaller of p+1 and q+1 to j-1. So:

            L_union = min(p+1, q+1)
            R_union = j-1

        Then the union is [L_union, R_union] and has length = (j-1) - L_union + 1 = j - L_union.

        And T = sum_{i=L_union}^{j-1} (min_val_old[i] * max_val_old[i])

        Therefore, we can compute:

            F(j) = F(j-1) + a_j^2   [for the subarray [j,j]]
                   + (if p < q: a_j * (sum_{i=p+1}^{q} max_val_old[i]) else 0)
                   + (if q < p: a_j * (sum_{i=q+1}^{p} min_val_old[i]) else 0)
                   + a_j^2 * (j-1 - max(p,q))   [because |both_interval| = j-1 - max(p,q) = j-1 - max(p,q)? Note: both_interval = [max(p,q)+1, j-1] -> length = j-1 - max(p,q) if max(p,q)+1<=j-1, else 0]
                   - (sum_{i=min(p+1, q+1)}^{j-1} (min_val_old[i] * max_val_old[i]))

        But note: we must update the state for the next iteration: we need to maintain the arrays min_val and max_val? 

        Actually, we are updating the min_val for [p+1, j] to a_j and the max_val for [q+1, j] to a_j. So after the update, we have:

            min_val[i] for i in [p+1, j] = a_j
            max_val[i] for i in [q+1, j] = a_j

        Therefore, we need to update the data structures that store min_val and max_val? 

        But we don't need the entire arrays, we only need to compute the sums for the next steps? 

        However, we need to maintain:

            The current min_val and max_val for each i (for the state j) so that we can compute the sums for the next j.

        Alternatively, we can maintain three Fenwick trees or segment trees:

            Tree1: stores min_val[i] for each i (and we do range assignment for min_val)
            Tree2: stores max_val[i] for each i (and we do range assignment for max_val)
            Tree3: stores min_val[i] * max_val[i] for each i (and we do range assignment for min_val and max_val, which can be done by updating the two trees and then updating the product tree? But that would be complex)

        And we also need to be able to query range sums: 
            For Tree1: range sum of min_val_old over a segment (for min_interval only: we need the min_val_old? but actually in the max_interval only we need the min_val_old? and for the product we need min_val_old * max_val_old? 

        But note: at state j-1, we have the old values. Then we update the trees for the new state j.

        We also need to compute:

            S_min_only = (if p<q) sum_{i=p+1}^{q} max_val_old[i]   -> note: we need the max_val_old, not min_val_old.

            S_max_only = (if q<p) sum_{i=q+1}^{p} min_val_old[i]   -> min_val_old.

            T = sum_{i=L_union}^{j-1} (min_val_old[i] * max_val_old[i])

        So we need to store and update:

            The array max_val and min_val for the state j-1? But we are updating them for state j.

        Actually, we can use a segment tree that supports:

            - Range assignment (set a segment to a value) for min_val and for max_val. And we also maintain a tree for the product.

        However, the product tree is updated as: 
            When we assign min_val for a segment, then the product for that segment becomes: min_val_new * max_val_old? 
            Similarly, if we assign max_val for a segment, the product becomes min_val_old * max_val_new? 
            But if we assign both, we have to do it in a particular order? 

        We can update the trees in the following order:

            First, store the old values for the segments we are about to update so we can compute the sums we need? 

        Alternatively, we can do:

            Step 1: For the current state j-1, we have segment trees for min_val, max_val, and product=min_val * max_val.

            Step 2: We compute the necessary sums (S_min_only, S_max_only, T) from the trees.

            Step 3: Then we update the trees: 
                    For min_val: assign a_j to the segment [p+1, j]
                    For max_val: assign a_j to the segment [q+1, j]

            And for the product tree: we update it as follows:
                    For the segment [p+1, j]: the min_val becomes a_j, so the product becomes a_j * max_val[i] -> but note: if we update min_val first, then the max_val might be updated later? 

            Actually, we have to update the min_val and then the max_val, and then the product? Or update the product in one go? 

            We can do:

                Update min_val for [p+1, j] to a_j. Then for that segment, the product becomes: a_j * max_val[i] (which might be the old max_val or we haven't updated max_val). Then update the max_val for [q+1, j] to a_j, and then for the segment [q+1, j] the product becomes a_j * min_val[i]? But then we overwrite.

        It's complex.

        Given the complexity, and the constraints (n=300000), we need O(log n) per update.

        But we have to update two segments and do three range queries per j. 

        We can maintain:

            Tree_min: segment tree for min_val, with lazy propagation for range assignment.
            Tree_max: segment tree for max_val, with lazy propagation for range assignment.
            Tree_prod: segment tree for the product min_val * max_val, but it must be updated whenever min_val or max_val changes.

        How to update Tree_prod? 

            When we assign min_val for a segment [L, R] to x, then the product for each i in [L,R] becomes: x * (current max_val[i]). So we need to do:

                Tree_prod[L,R] = x * (sum of max_val in [L,R])

            Similarly, when we assign max_val for a segment [L,R] to y, then the product for each i in [L,R] becomes: (current min_val[i]) * y.

            But if we update min_val and then max_val, then we must be cautious: the update of min_val might change the product, then the update of max_val will change it again.

        We can do the updates in two steps:

            Step 1: update min_val for [p+1, j] to a_j, and update the product for this segment: 
                Tree_prod[L,R] = a_j * Tree_max[L,R]   [we need the current max_val in that segment]

            But note: the max_val in that segment might be the old one? Yes, and then we are going to update the max_val for [q+1, j] to a_j. So then we update the product for the max_val update: 

                For [q+1, j]: the product becomes: min_val[i] * a_j.

            However, the segment [p+1, j] and [q+1, j] might overlap. 

            Actually, we should update the min_val and max_val trees first, and then rebuild the product tree? But that is O(n).

        Alternatively, we can avoid storing the product tree explicitly. Instead, we store:

            Tree_min: min_val array with range assignment and range sum.
            Tree_max: max_val array with range assignment and range sum.
            Tree_minmax: the product, but updated in a lazy way: we do two separate updates for min and max, and each update uses the current value of the other tree.

        We design the trees:

            Tree_min: supports range assignment (set to a constant) and range sum.
            Tree_max: supports range assignment and range sum.
            Tree_prod: we do not store explicitly. Instead, when we need to query the sum of the product over a range, we cannot do it without storing it.

        But the issue: we need to query the product sum over a range at state j-1 (before the update) to compute T, and also we need to query the sum of min_val_old and max_val_old for the state j-1.

        Therefore, we can do:

            Before updating for j, we have the trees at state j-1. We then:

                Query1: if p<q, then we need the sum of max_val_old in [p+1, q] -> use Tree_max.range_query(p+1, q)
                Query2: if q<p, then we need the sum of min_val_old in [q+1, p] -> use Tree_min.range_query(q+1, p)
                Query3: T = the sum of product over [L_union, j-1] -> but we don't have a tree for product? 

        So we must maintain a separate tree for the product? 

        We can maintain a fourth tree: Tree_prod, which stores the product for each i. And we update it when we update min_val or max_val? 

        But updating min_val for a segment will change the product for that segment. So we have to update Tree_prod as well.

        We design:

            We have three trees: 
                T_min: for min_val, supports range assignment and range sum.
                T_max: for max_val, supports range assignment and range sum.
                T_prod: for the product, supports point update? But we do range assignment for min_val and max_val, so we need range update for T_prod.

        How to update T_prod when we do a range assignment for min_val? 

            For a segment [L,R] we set min_val to x. Then for each i in [L,R], the new product = x * max_val[i]. 
            But note: we have T_max available, so we can compute the sum over the segment of max_val[i]. Then we can set T_prod for that segment to x * (sum of max_val in [L,R])? But that is the sum of the product, not the product per element.

            Actually, we need the entire array of products to be stored so that we can do range sum queries.

        Alternatively, we can avoid storing T_prod as a separate tree and instead compute the product for a segment as the sum of (min_val[i]*max_val[i]) by storing the product per element? But then updating a range for min_val would require knowing the max_val for each element in the range, and we only have the sum of max_val for the range.

        We can maintain a lazy segment tree that stores:

            For each node, we store:
                sum_min: the sum of min_val in the segment
                sum_max: the sum of max_val in the segment
                sum_prod: the sum of min_val[i]*max_val[i] in the segment

            And then lazy propagation for min_val and for max_val.

        But the lazy propagation for min_val: if we assign min_val = x for a segment, then:
            sum_min = x * (length)
            sum_prod = x * (sum_max)   [because min_val is set to x, so the product becomes x * max_val]

        Similarly, if we assign max_val = y for a segment, then:
            sum_max = y * (length)
            sum_prod = (sum_min) * y   [because the product becomes min_val * y]

        But what if we have both lazy assignments in a node? Then we need to combine the assignments: 

            We can have two lazy values: lazy_min and lazy_max, and a flag for each.

            When updating min_val to x, we set:
                lazy_min = x, and then update the node's sum_min = x * len, and sum_prod = x * (sum_max)   [but note: if there is a lazy_max, then the max_val is already set to some value, so we use the lazy_max? or the current sum_max?]

        Actually, the current sum_max in the node might be the one after the lazy_max update. So we design:

            We store:
                lazy_min: either None or a value x meaning the entire segment min_val is x.
                lazy_max: either None or a value y meaning the entire segment max_val is y.

            Then the values for the segment can be computed as:
                min_val = (lazy_min if not None, else the value from children) -> but we are storing the entire segment tree.

            When we assign min_val = x to the segment, we do:
                lazy_min = x
                sum_min = x * len
                if lazy_max is not None:
                    sum_prod = x * lazy_max * len   [because for every element: min_val=x, max_val=lazy_max]
                else:
                    # then the max_val is stored in the children? but we are updating the entire segment, so we don't have the children's max_val? 
                    # Actually, we must maintain the true sum of max_val for the segment? But we have lazy_max for the entire segment, so if we have lazy_max, then we use lazy_max, else we have the sum_max from the children? 

            This becomes very messy.

        Given the complexity, and the fact that there are two independent lazy updates, we can use a segment tree that is designed for two types of lazy propagation. However, we can also note that the updates are for disjoint intervals? 

        Actually, the updates for min_val and max_val might overlap arbitrarily, but in our algorithm, we update min_val for [p+1, j] and then update max_val for [q+1, j]. The overlap is [max(p+1, q+1), j]. But then for the product in the overlap, it becomes a_j * a_j.

        We can do:

            Step 1: For the segment [p+1, j]:
                    Update min_val to a_j.
                    Then update the product: for this segment, the product becomes: a_j * (current max_val[i]). 
                    But note: the current max_val[i] might be the old one. Then we will update the max_val for [q+1, j] to a_j.

            Step 2: For the segment [q+1, j]:
                    Update max_val to a_j.
                    Then update the product: for this segment, the product becomes: (current min_val[i]) * a_j.

            But in the overlap [max(p+1, q+1), j]: 
                    In step1: we set min_val to a_j, so the product becomes a_j * (old max_val[i]).
                    In step2: we set max_val to a_j, so the product becomes a_j * a_j.

            So the overlap is updated twice.

        Therefore, we should update the product in the overlap only once to a_j * a_j.

        This suggests we should do the two updates and then correct the overlap? 

        Alternatively, we can update the non-overlapping parts separately:

            Part1: [p+1, q] (if p<q) -> only min_val update: then the product = a_j * (old max_val[i])
            Part2: [q+1, j] (which is the max_val update) -> but note: this segment might include the overlap for min_val update? Actually, [q+1, j] is exactly the overlap if p<q? 

            Then in part2, we update the max_val to a_j, and the min_val in part2 is not updated yet? Actually, in step1 we updated [p+1, j] which includes [p+1, q] and [q+1, j]. So [q+1, j] already has min_val = a_j. Then when we update the max_val to a_j, the product becomes a_j * a_j.

        But if we update in two steps, then for [q+1, j] we do:

            First, in step1: set min_val to a_j, and then the product becomes a_j * (old max_val[i]) for i in [q+1, j].
            Then in step2: set max_val to a_j, and then the product becomes a_j * a_j.

        So we can simply update the trees in order, but then the intermediate product is not the final one.

        Then for the next iteration, the state will be correct.

        But for the current iteration, we only need the old state (before any updates) to compute the change.

        Therefore, we can:

            Before any updates for j, we have the state at j-1. We then:

                - Query the necessary sums: 
                   if p<q: S1 = query_max_sum(p+1, q)
                   if q<p: S2 = query_min_sum(q+1, p)
                   T = query_prod_sum(L_union, j-1)   # where L_union = min(p+1, q+1)

                - Then compute F(j) = F(j-1) + a_j^2 + ... [as above]

            Then update the trees for the new state j:

                - Update the min_val for [p+1, j] to a_j: 
                    update_min(p+1, j, a_j)   -> and in this update, we also update the product tree: set the product for this segment to a_j * (current max_val in the segment)   [which is the old max_val, because we haven't updated max_val yet]

                - Update the max_val for [q+1, j] to a_j:
                    update_max(q+1, j, a_j)   -> and in this update, we also update the product tree: set the product for this segment to (current min_val in the segment) * a_j.

                But note: in the overlap [max(p+1, q+1), j], the first update set the product to a_j * (old max_val) and then the second update sets it to (min_val in the segment) * a_j. But after the first update, the min_val in the overlap is a_j. So the second update sets it to a_j * a_j.

                This is correct.

        The trees must support:

            - For T_min: range assignment and range sum.
            - For T_max: range assignment and range sum.
            - For T_prod: 
                  when updating min_val for [l,r] to x: 
                      then T_prod[l,r] = x * T_max[l,r]   (using the current T_max values, which are the ones before the update for max_val that we are about to do)
                  when updating max_val for [l,r] to y:
                      then T_prod[l,r] = T_min[l,r] * y

        And we also need range sum query for T_min, T_max, and T_prod.

        We can use a segment tree with lazy propagation for each. 

        Implementation complexity: we need three segment trees, each supporting range assignment and range sum. And the product tree's update depends on the other trees.

        However, the trees for T_min and T_max are independent. 

        How to update T_prod when we update T_min for [l,r] to x? 

            We would do:
                Let S = T_max.get_sum(l, r)   [the current sum of max_val in [l,r]]
                Then T_prod.set_range(l, r, value = x * (S) / (r-l+1) )? -> no, because the product for each element is x * max_val[i], so the sum is x * S.

            But wait, if we set the product for the segment [l,r] to x * (sum of max_val in [l,r]), then that is exactly the sum of the new product.

            So we can do:
                T_prod.set_range(l, r, new_prod_sum = x * T_max.get_sum(l, r))

            Similarly, when updating T_max for [l,r] to y:
                T_prod.set_range(l, r, new_prod_sum = y * T_min.get_sum(l, r))

        However, note: after we update T_min for [l,r] to x, we should also update T_min in the tree, and then the product update uses the current T_max in that segment.

        But then when we later update T_max for a overlapping segment, the T_min tree has been updated, so the product update will use the new T_min.

        This is what we want.

        Therefore, the plan for each j is:

            Let p = the nearest index to the left of j such that a_p < a_j (for min: the previous smaller element). If none, p=0.
            Let q = the nearest index to the left of j such that a_q > a_j (for max: the previous greater element). If none, q=0.

            Then:

                L_union = min(p+1, q+1)
                R_union = j-1   (if L_union <= j-1)

            Query:
                if p < q: 
                    S1 = T_max.get_sum(p+1, q)
                if q < p:
                    S2 = T_min.get_sum(q+1, p)
                T = T_prod.get_sum(L_union, j-1)   # if L_union <= j-1, else 0

                Also, let len_both = max(0, j-1 - max(p,q))

            Then:
                F(j) = F(j-1) + a_j^2 
                       + a_j * (S1 if p<q else 0 + S2 if q<p else 0)
                       + a_j^2 * len_both 
                       - T

            Then update:

                # First, for the min: update the segment [p+1, j] in T_min to a_j, and update T_prod for this segment: 
                T_min.update_range(p+1, j, a_j)
                # Update T_prod for [p+1, j]: 
                    sum_max_in_segment = T_max.get_sum(p+1, j)
                    # But note: we are about to update the max for [q+1, j], but we want the current max_val (which is the state before the max update) for the product update for the min assignment.
                    new_prod_sum = a_j * sum_max_in_segment
                    T_prod.update_range(p+1, j, new_prod_sum)   # But wait: our T_prod tree does not support setting to a constant sum for the segment? We need to assign the entire segment's product to the new value.

                Actually, we have to support range assignment for T_prod? 

                Alternatively, we can design the trees for T_min and T_max to be independent, and then T_prod is not stored but computed on the fly? But then we cannot query T_prod.get_sum for the next steps.

                Or we can store the lazy for T_prod? But then we have to update it on every update to T_min or T_max.

                Instead, we can do without a separate T_prod tree: 

                    We can compute the sum of the product as needed by storing the current min and max per element and use a Fenwick tree? But then updating a range would be O(n).

                Given the complexity, and that we are doing O(n) steps, and each step does O(1) range updates and range queries (which are O(log n)), the total is O(n log n).

            Then similarly for the max update:

                T_max.update_range(q+1, j, a_j)
                # Then update T_prod for [q+1, j]: 
                    sum_min_in_segment = T_min.get_sum(q+1, j)   # but note: we already updated the min for the segment [p+1, j] which might overlap, so in the overlap [max(p+1,q+1), j] the min_val is a_j.
                    new_prod_sum = a_j * sum_min_in_segment
                    T_prod.update_range(q+1, j, new_prod_sum)

            But wait: for the overlap [max(p+1, q+1), j], we updated T_prod twice: 
                First in the min update: we set it to a_j * (old max_val in the segment)
                Then in the max update: we set it to a_j * (current min_val in the segment) = a_j * a_j.

            That is correct.

        However, the function T_prod.update_range(l, r, x) is not a standard addition, but a range assignment. We need to support range assignment for T_prod as well.

        Summary of the data structures:

            We will use three segment trees (or Fenwick trees with range assignment? but typically we do point updates or range add, not range assignment). 

            But range assignment (setting a segment to a specific value) is not the same as assigning the same value to each element. Here, when we update T_prod for [l, r], we are setting the entire segment to have a specific sum? 

            No, we are setting the entire segment to have a specific sum for the entire segment? 

            Actually, we don't need the per-element value in T_prod, only the range sum. But when we assign the new_prod_sum for [l, r], we are setting the sum of the segment to a specific value. This is not per-element assignment. 

            For example, when updating for min in [l, r]: 
                new_prod_sum = a_j * (T_max.get_sum(l, r))

            This is a constant for the entire segment? But then if we want to do range assignment per element, we would set each element i in [l, r] to a_j * (max_val[i]) (at the time of the query for T_max). But then the sum is a_j * (sum of max_val in [l, r]).

            However, after this update, the max_val might change, and then the product would be out of date.

            Therefore, we must update the product for the segment to the new value: the entire segment's product sum becomes the new_prod_sum. 

            And we are not storing per-element product, only the sum for the segment. And we will only use it for future queries and updates.

            But note: after the min update and then the max update, we will update the product again for the max update.

            How to implement a segment tree that supports range assignment (set the sum of the segment to a given value) and range sum query? 

            Actually, we don't need the per-element values, so we can store the entire segment tree with lazy propagation for the entire segment sum. But then we lose the per-element values. 

            Alternatively, we can simply not store T_prod as a separate tree that is updated in this manner. Instead, we can avoid the product tree by not using the formula with T. 

        Let me try to simplify the change formula without T:

            We have to compute the change in the product sum for the entire array [1, j] from state j-1 to state j.

            The product for an index i in [1, j-1] changes from min_val_old[i] * max_val_old[i] to:

                If i in [p+1, j] and in [q+1, j]: then new = a_j^2.
                If i in [p+1, j] only: then new = a_j * max_val_old[i]
                If i in [q+1, j] only: then new = min_val_old[i] * a_j

            Then the change for i is: new - old.

            So the total change for [1, j-1] is:

                = sum_{i in [p+1, j]} (a_j * max_val_old[i] - min_val_old[i]*max_val_old[i])   [for the min update]
                  + sum_{i in [q+1, j]} (min_val_old[i] * a_j - min_val_old[i]*max_val_old[i])
                  - sum_{i in [max(p+1, q+1), j]} (a_j * max_val_old[i] - min_val_old[i]*max_val_old[i])   ??? 

            This is not efficient.

        Given the complexity, known solutions for this problem exist. We can use a stack to maintain the current min and max and use a different method.

 Known efficient solution:

        There is a known solution in C++ for this problem. The approach is to use a stack to maintain the min and max, and also to use a set of variables to hold the current running sum of min, max, and min*max.

        Alternatively, we can use a deque and maintain the current min and max for the subarrays ending at j, and use a segment tree or a heap? 

        A simpler method is to use a Cartesian tree and D&C, but the known solution is to use a stack and 
        the following: 

        Let dp[j] = sum_{i=1}^{j} (min(a[i..j]) * (max(a[i..j]))

        Then we try to compute dp[j] from dp[j-1] and by updating the necessary segments.

        And we maintain two stacks: 
            one for the minima (monotonic increasing stack)
            one for the maxima (monotonic decreasing stack)

        And also maintain:

            sum_min[j] = sum_{i=1}^{j} min(a[i..j])
            sum_max[j] = sum_{i=1}^{j} max(a[i..j])
            sum_prod[j] = sum_{i=1}^{j} min(a[i..j]) * max(a[i..j])   = dp[j]

        And then we try to update these sums.

        There is a known technique: 
            sum_min[j] = sum_min[j-1] + something (using the stack for min)

        Specifically, let the previous smaller element for j be at position p. Then for i in [p+1, j]: the min is a_j, and for i in [1, p]: the min is the same as in the state j-1. 
        So: sum_min[j] = sum_min[p] + a_j * (j - p)

        Similarly, for sum_max[j]: 
            sum_max[j] = sum_max[q] + a_j * (j - q)

        But for sum_prod[j], it is more complex. 

        We have:

            sum_prod[j] = sum_prod[j-1] 
                           + a_j^2   // for the subarray [j,j]
                           + [ for i in [p+1, j-1]: change in min from old_min to a_j, so the product changes from (old_min_i * old_max_i) to (a_j * old_max_i) ]
                           + [ for i in [q+1, j-1]: change in max from old_max to a_j, so the product changes from (old_min_i * old_max_i) to (old_min_i * a_j) ]
                           - [ for i in [max(p+1, q+1), j-1]: the change is counted twice ]

        But we can use the same formula as before.

        And we also maintain for the state j-1 the following for each i: 
            min_val[i] and max_val[i]

        but we don't have to store the entire array, only the necessary sums.

        Specifically, we maintain:

            using two segment trees for the current state j-1 for the entire array [1, j-1] for min_val and max_val and product. 

        Given the time, I will go with the three segment trees. 

        But to within the time limit in Python, we might need to use a more efficient implementation. However, the problem constraints are 300000, and segment tree with lazy propagation is O(n log n).

        We will implement the three trees with lazy propagation for range assignment. 
        For each tree, we support:
            void range_assign(int l, int r, int val, bool is_min_tree)
            long long range_sum(int l, int r)

        For the min tree and max tree, the range assignment sets the entire segment [l, r] to val.
        For the product tree, the range assignment sets the entire segment [l, r] to a given total sum value? 
            But then how to do lazy propagation? 

        Alternatively, we can make the product tree also support range assignment per element: then the update for the product tree would be: 
            When we assign min_val for [l, r] to x, then for each element i in [l, r], the product becomes x * max_val[i]. 
            So the new product for element i is x * max_val[i]. 
            Then the sum is x * (sum of max_val in [l, r]).

        But note: the max_val in [l, r] might not be the same for all elements, so we cannot use a constant assignment for the product tree. 

        Therefore, we should not store the product tree explicitly, but rather compute the sum of product as the sum over the array of (min_val[i] * max_val[i]) on the fly from the other trees? 

        But then we cannot query it without O(n) time.

        Instead, we can forgo the product tree and store only the min tree and max tree, and then when we need T = sum_{i=l}^{r} (min_val[i] * max_val[i]), we can use a segment tree that has in each node the sum of min_val, the sum of max_val, and the sum of product, and also the lazy for min and max. 

        This is a more advanced tree. 

        We design a segment tree that maintains for each node:

            struct Node {
                sum_min: int
                sum_max: int
                sum_prod: int
                lazy_min: int or None
                lazy_max: int or None
            }

        And the lazy propagation: 

            When pushing lazy_min to a node, if the node has lazy_min, we 
                of course, we might have to push to children.

            The update for the node if we assign min_val = x to the whole node's segment:

                sum_min = x * (length)
                sum_prod = x * sum_max   [because the product becomes x * max_val for each element]
                then set lazy_min = x

            Similarly for max_val = y:

                sum_max = y * (length)
                sum_prod = sum_min * y
                lazy_max = y

        But if a node has both lazy_min and lazy_max, then the last update wins? 

        Actually, if we assign min_val and then max_val, the product becomes x * y for the whole segment. 

        But if we have a node that has a pending lazy_min and we assign a new lazy_min, then the new one overrides.

        The propagation is as follows:

            We design the node to have two separate lazy values: for min and for max.

            When we assign min_val = x to a node that has no pending min lazy (or has one, we override), then we do:

                node.sum_min = x * len
                node.sum_prod = x * node.sum_max
                node.lazy_min = x

            When we assign max_val = y to a node that has no pending max lazy, then:

                node.sum_max = y * len
                node.sum_prod = node.sum_min * y
                node.lazy_max = y

            But if the node has pending min assignment and we assign max, then the min_val in the node is the lazy_min, not the sum_min from the children. So we use the lazy_min to compute the product.

            The issue is when we update a node that has pending lazy for the other variable.

        When we have to update a node that has both lazy_min and and we update with a new min_val, we simply overwrite the lazy_min.

        Similarly for max_val.

        When pushing down the lazy values to the children, we assign the lazy_min to the children and then reset the node's lazy_min to None. But note: if we assign min_val to the children, it will change the children's sum_min, sum_prod, and then the node's sum_min and sum_prod will be recalculated from the children. 

        However, we are not doing that because we are doing range assignments and then queries, and we are not doing complex combining. 

        We can and with a segment tree that has lazy propagation for two types of range assignment. 

        We will assume that the updates are for min first and then for max in a given j, but they might be in any order and might overlap arbitrarily.

        The tree should support:

            range_assign_min(l, r, x): 
                set min_val for [l, r] to x.
            range_assign_max(l, r, y): 
                set max_val for [l, r] to y.
            range_sum(l, r): 
                return (sum_min, sum_max, sum_prod) for the segment [l, r]? 
                But we need only the sum_prod for our purpose.

        Actually, we only need the range sum for the product and for the min and max individually.

        We can either return a tuple or have three separate queries.

        Given the complexity, we will maintain such a tree.

        Steps for j:

            p = previous smaller element for a_j (using a min_stack)
            q = previous larger element for a_j (using a max_stack)

            // Query the necessary sums from the tree for the state at j-1 (before updates for j) for the segments:

            if p < q:
                S1 = tree.range_sum_max(p+1, q)   // the sum of max_val in [p+1, q] at state j-1
            else if q < p:
                S2 = tree.range_sum_min(q+1, p)   // the sum of min_val in [q+1, p] at state j-1

            L_union = min(p+1, q+1)
            R = j-1
            if L_union <= R:
                T = tree.range_sum_prod(L_union, R) 
            else:
                T = 0

            len_both = max(0, j-1 - max(p, q))

            // Then compute F(j) = F(j-1) + a_j^2 + a_j*(S1 if p<q else 0 + S2 if q<p else 0) + a_j^2 * len_both - T

            // Then update the tree for the new state j:

            // First, update min_val for [p+1, j] to a_j
            if p+1 <= j:
                tree.range_assign_min(p+1, j, a_j)

            // Then, update max_val for [q+1, j] to a_j
            if q+1 <= j:
                tree.range_assign_max(q+1, j, a_j)

            // Note: the tree internally will update the product.

        Then move to j+1.

        The tree must be for the array of size n, and initially for j=0, we have an empty array. 

        We will initialize the tree with size n.

        For j=1:
            a_1 = a[0] (0-indexed)
            p = 0 (for min: no element, so p=0), q=0 (for max: no element, so q=0)
            Then:
                len_both = max(0, 0 - max(0,0)) = 0.
                S1 and S2 are 0.
                T = tree.range_sum_prod(1,0) = 0.
                F(1) = 0 + a_1^2 = a_1^2.

            Then update the tree for [1,1] (0-indexed: [0,0]):
                tree.range_assign_min(1,1, a_1) -> [0,0]: min=a_1.
                tree.range_assign_max(1,1, a_1) -> [0,0]: max=a_1.

        For j=2:
            // a_2 is the second element.

        However, note: our tree is for the array up to j, and the indices i in [0, j-1] (0-indexed) are the ones that are active.

        Implementation of the tree:

            We will build a segment tree for the array of size n, initially for i not yet active, min_val and max_val are not defined. 

            We can initialize the tree to zeros for min_val and max_val for positions > j. But we will only update and query within [0, j-1] for the state j-1.

            For the state j-1, the tree has been updated for the array up to j-1.

            When we extend to j, we will update for the new position j: 

                But in the above, for the new position j, we haven't updated it. 
                In the tree, for the new position j, what is the state? 

            Initially, the tree for positions beyond the current j is not updated. 

            We can do: 

                Before processing j, the tree has information for indices 0 to j-1.

                The new element a_j will be incorporated by the range updates: we update [p+1, j] which includes j.

            So we should ensure that the tree for index j is initially at min_val = infinity? and max_val = -infinity? 

            But then the range assignment will set it to a_j.

        Therefore, we can initialize the tree to have for each leaf i: 
            min_val = 0, max_val = 0, product=0. 
            And then when we update a leaf that hasn't been touched, we set it.

        Or we can do range updates only for the active indices.

        Given the complexity of the tree, and the constraints, we will implement a segment tree for the whole array of size n, and initially all values are 0. 

        Then when we update a range that includes new index j, we set it to a_j.

        But then the min_val for index j will be set to a_j, and then the max_val will be set to a_j.

        The initial 0 for index j will be overwritten.

        So it is safe.

        The modulo: 1000003233.

        Note: a_j up to 1e9, and n up to 300000, so the sums can be up to 300000 * (1e9 * 1e9) = 3e19, so we use int64 and modulo arithmetic.

        In the segment tree, we do modulo arithmetic for the product and for the sums? 

        However, the sums of min_val and max_val might be large: up to 300000 * 1e9 = 3e14, which fits in int64. 
        The sum of the product might be up to 300000 * (1e9)^2 = 3e19, which is near the limit of int64 (about 9e18), so we use int128? or use modulo arithmetic for the product sum?

        The problem asks for the answer modulo 1000003233.

        So we can do all arithmetic in modular arithmetic. However, the intermediate sums for the tree might be large, but we can do: 

          In the tree, we store the sums modulo mod? 

        But then when we do: 
            tree.range_assign_min(l, r, x): 
                new_sum_min = x * (r-l+1)   mod mod
                new_sum_prod = x * (current sum_max)   mod mod

        This is valid.

        Similarly for range_assign_max.

        Therefore, we will do modulo arithmetic in the tree.

        But note: the formula for F(j) might involve large intermediate sums, so we do:

            F(j) = (F(j-1) + a_j*a_j + a_j*(S1 or S2) + a_j*a_j * len_both - T) % mod

        But note: if we are in C++ we have to use nonnegative modulo, but in Python we can use % at the end.

        However, to avoid overflow in intermediate products (a_j might be 1e9, and S1 might be 3e14, so a_j * S1 might be 3e23 which is too big for int64), we do modular arithmetic for these terms? 

        But note: the modulus is 1000003233, which is about 1e9, so we can do:

            term1 = a_j * a_j % mod
            term2 = a_j * (S1 or S2) might be huge: so we do modulo multiplication for a_j and the large sum.

        However, the formula is:

            F(j) = F(j-1) + a_j^2 + a_j * (S1 or S2) + a_j^2 * len_both - T

        But note: S1 and S2 and T are sums that are computed modulo mod? 

        We have a choice: 

            Option 1: Do all sums in the tree in actual integers (using Python's big integers) and then do mod at the end of each F(j) -> but the numbers might be huge.

            Option 2: Do the tree in modulo arithmetic.

        But the tree might need to store sum_min and sum_max for range_sum_min and range_sum_max queries that are used in updates for the product. However, when we update the product using the sum_max, we do: 

            new_sum_prod = x * (sum_max)   [mod mod]

        So if we store sum_min and sum_max in modulo, then the new_sum_prod will be in modulo.

        This is valid.

        Therefore, we will do all arithmetic in the tree modulo mod, and also for the computation of F(j) we do modulo arithmetic.

        Summary of the algorithm:

            mod = 1000003233
            n = int(input())
            a = list(map(int, input().split()))

            # Initialize:
            F = 0
            # We'll use three stacks for the previous smaller and greater.
            min_stack = []   # (index, value), increasing values
            max_stack = []   # (index, value), decreasing values

            # Initialize the segment tree for the array of size n. We'll create a segment tree that supports:
            #   range_assign_min(l, r, x)
            #   range_assign_max(l, r, y)
            #   range_sum_min(l, r) -> sum of min_val in [l, r] (0-indexed)
            #   range_sum_max(l, r) -> sum of max_val in [l, r]
            #   range_sum_prod(l, r) -> sum of (min_val[i]*max_val[i]) for i in [l, r]

            tree = SegmentTree(n, mod)

            res = 0   # this will be F for the current j, and we will accumulate.

                    min_stack.pop()
                if not min_stack:
                    p = -1   # then the next is [0, j]

                while max_stack and max_stack[-1][1] < a[j]:

                # The next element to the right of p is p+1, but if p=-1, then p+1=0.
                # The next element to the right of q is q+1, if q=-1, then q+1=0.

                # For the state before adding a[j] (which means the tree currently has information for indices [0, j-1]), we query:

                # If we are at j=0, then the tree is empty? But we will update for j=0.
                # We treat j=0 separately if needed.

                # For j>=0, we are about to update the tree for the new element at j.

                # First, compute the new term for the subarray [j,j]: a[j]^2.
                new_term = a[j] * a[j] % mod

                # Then, the change from the subarrays [i, j] for i in [0, j-1]:

                #   Let L_min = p+1 if p!=-1 else 0, R_min = j-1  -> the min update interval: [p+1, j]
                #   Let L_max = q+1 if q!=-1 else 0, R_max = j-1  -> the max update interval: [q+1, j]

                #   Note: the tree does not have the j-th element initialized? We haven't updated it. But our tree is defined for the whole array, and initially min_val and max_val are 0. 
                #   We will update the j-th element in the range update.

                #   But the queries for the tree will be on [0, j-1] (for the state before update), so we use [L_min, j-1] and [L_max, j-1].

            # Output res

        However, note: the both_interval = [max(p_val+1, q_val+1), j-1] -> len_both = (j-1) - (max(p_val, q_val)) 
        because: 
            start = max(p_val+1, q_val+1) = max(p_val, q_val) + 1
            end = j-1
            length = (j-1) - (max(p_val, q_val)+1) + 1 = j-1 - max(p_val, q_val)

        But wait, the number of integers from L to R is R-L+1.
        So if L = max(p_val, q_val)+1, R = j-1, then the length = (j-1) - (max(p_val, q_val)+1) + 1 = j-1 - max(p_val, q_val) -1 +1 = j-1 - max(p_val, q_val)

        But we defined len_both as that, so it is correct.

        This solution is O(n log n) and should work for n=300000.

        We must now implement the segment tree.

        Segment tree implementation for two lazy assignments:

            We design a segment tree that supports:
                - range_assign_min(l, r, x)
                - range_assign_max(l, r, y)
                - queries: range_sum_min, range_sum_max, range_sum_prod

            The tree will have an array of nodes for the leaves, and we use 0-indexed.

            We will use a standard segment tree with lazy propagation.

            The node structure:

                class Node:
                    l, r: the segment [l, r]
                    sum_min: int (mod mod)
                    sum_max: int (mod mod)
                    sum_prod: int (mod mod)
                    lazy_min: int or None if not assigned
                    lazy_max: int or None if not assigned

            When we assign min_val = x to a node's segment, we do:

                self.sum_min = (x * (r-l+1)) % mod
                self.sum_prod = (x * self.sum_max) % mod
                self.lazy_min = x
                # Note: we do not change lazy_max.

            When we assign max_val = y to a node's segment, we do:

                self.sum_max = (y * (r-l+1)) % mod
                self.sum_prod = (self.sum_min * y) % mod
                self.lazy_max = y

            When pushing down to children:

                If the node has lazy_min, then we assign min_val to both children, and then reset lazy_min to None.
                Similarly for lazy_max.

            But note: when pushing down, the children may have their own lazy values, which will be overwritten.

            Then we update the children's sum_min, sum_max, sum_prod.

            After pushing down, we update the node's sum from the children.

            However, this is a range assignment and the tree is not for incremental updates, so we do not combine assignments.

            The assignment for min or max is for the whole segment.

            The segment tree will support:

                range_assign_min(l, r, x)
                range_assign_max(l, r, y)
                range_sum_min(l, r)   -> returns the sum of min_val in [l, r]
                range_sum_max(l, r)   -> returns the sum of max_val in [l, r]
                range_sum_prod(l, r)  -> returns the sum of (min_val * max_val) in [l, r]

            We will build a tree that covers [0, n-1].

        Given the complexity, we will implement this tree.

        However, this solution is very long and we are not writing code, so we hope the editorial is clear.

        Finally, note that we are only using the tree for indices from 0 to j (and queries for [0, j-1]), and we are extending j from 0 to n-1.

        Let me test with sample: n=3, a = [1,2,3]

            j=0: a[0]=1
                min_stack: push(0,1) -> p = -1 -> L_min = 0
                max_stack: push(0,1) -> q = -1 -> L_max = 0
                new_term = 1
                p and q are both -1: 
                    len_both = 0   (since j-1 = -1, so T=0, and both_interval not defined, we set T=0)
                change = 0
                res = 1
                update tree: 
                    range_assign_min(0,0,1)  -> [0,0]: sum_min=1, sum_max=0, then we do min assign: sum_min=1, sum_prod=1*0=0? 
                    then range_assign_max(0,0,1) -> [0,0]: sum_max=1, sum_prod=1*1=1.

                So after update: the tree at index0: min=1, max=1, product=1.

            j=1: a[1]=2
                min_stack: while and push (1,2): p = 0 (because min_stack has (0,1) and 1<2, so p=0)
                max_stack: while and push (1,2): q = -1? because 1<2 -> pop until empty, then q=-1.
                new_term = 4.
                Now: p=0, q=-1.
                Since q=-1, we consider p_val=0, q_val=-1.
                Then: 
                    L_union = min(0+1, 0) = min(1,0) = 0?   -> but if q_val=-1, then we set L_union = p_val+1? 
                    In our code: 
                        if p_val == -1 and q_val == -1: then ... (skip)
                        else:
                            if p_val == -1: then L_union = q_val+1
                            if q_val == -1: then L_union = p_val+1
                            else: min(p_val+1, q_val+1)
                    So L_union = p_val+1 = 1.

                Then T = tree.range_sum_prod(1,0) = 0 (because [1,0] is empty) -> T=0.
                len_both = ? 
                    M = max(p_val, q_val) = max(0, -1) = 0
                    len_both = j-1 - M = 0 - 0 = 0.

                Also, we do: 
                    if p and q: ... -> not applicable.
                    else if q < p: not applicable because q=-1 and p=0, we do the else (which is p<q or q<p? we only do if p<q or q<p explicitly) -> in our code we did:
                        if p and q and p<q: ... 
                        elif p and q and q<p: ... 
                    So we skip the a_j * (S1 or S2) part.

                change = 0 + 2^2 * 0 - 0 = 0.
                res = 1 + 4 + 0 = 5.

                Then update:
                    min: [p+1, j] = [0+1,1] = [1,1] -> assign min=2.
                    max: [q+1, j] = [0,1] (since q=-1 -> L_max=0) -> assign max=2.

                For the tree:
                    index0: we did not update in this step, so min=1, max=1, product=1.
                    index1: 
                        min: assigned to 2 -> then in the tree: 
                            For the node [1,1]: 
                                range_assign_min: sum_min=2, sum_prod=2 * (current sum_max at index1) -> but initially, what is the max at index1? 
                                We haven't updated it to 2 yet? 
                        Then range_assign_max for [0,1]: 
                            This will update index0 and index1 to max=2.

                        For index0: 
                            currently: min=1, max=1 -> then update max to 2: 
                                sum_max = 2, 
                                sum_prod = min_val * 2 = 1*2 = 2.
                        For index1: 
                            we had min=2, and then update max=2: 
                                sum_max = 2, 
                                sum_prod = 2*2 = 4.

                So the tree state: 
                    index0: (1,2,2)
                    index1: (2,2,4)

                The product sum for [0,1] = 2+4 = 6.

            j=2: a[2]=3
                min_stack: p = the last index with value<3 -> that is at index1 (value=2), so p=1.
                max_stack: q = -1? 
                    stack: we pop until empty? because 2<3, so we pop index1, then the stack has index0 (value=1) which is <3, so we pop. Then empty, so q=-1.
                new_term = 9.
                p=1, q=-1.
                Then L_union = p_val+1 = 1+1=2? 
                    Then T = tree.range_sum_prod(2,1) = 0.
                len_both = j-1 - max(p_val, q_val) = 1 - max(1, -1) = 1-1 = 0.
                change = 0 + 3^2 * 0 - 0 = 0.

                Also, the a_j * (S1 or S2) part: we skip.

                res = 5+9 = 14.

                But the sample output is 25.

        Clearly, we are missing the change from the subarrays [0,2] and [1,2] and [0,1] is already included in F(1)=5? 

        Let me manually compute for [0,2]: 
            [0,0]: 1 -> 1
            [1,1]: 2 -> 4
            [2,2]: 3 -> 9
            [0,1]: min=1, max=2 -> 1*2=2
            [1,2]: min=2, max=3 -> 2*3=6
            [0,2]: min=1, max=3 -> 1*3=3
            Total = 1+4+9+2+6+3 = 25.

        Our F(0)=1, F(1)=5, F(2)=14, then we need F(2)=25.

        For j=2, the change for the subarrays [0,2], [1,2] (which are the ones ending at 2) is not 0.

        How do we compute the change for j=2?

            p=1, q=-1.
            We do: 
                S1: not applicable (since not (p<q)) and not (q<p) because we only do if both are not -1 and p and q are defined? But q=-1, so we skip the a_j*(S1 or S2) part.

            Then len_both = 0.
            T = tree.range_sum_prod(2,1)=0.

            change = 0.

            Then we add new_term=9, so F(2)=14.

        What is missing?

            In the change formula, we have to account for the change in the subarrays that are not the entire [0,2] and [1,2] and [0,2] but in the ones that we updated.

            Specifically, for the min update: we update [p+1, j] = [1+1, 2] = [2,2] to min=3? 
            For the max update: we update [q+1, j] = [0,2] to max=3.

            Then for the subarrays ending at 2:

                [0,2]: 
                   In state j-1 (j=2, so state j-1: for the tree at j=1) the min_val for i=0: min_val[0]=1, for i=1: min_val[1]=2.
                   Then for i=0: the min becomes min(1,2,3)=1, but it was min(1,2)=1 -> so no change? 
                   Actually, in state j-1, we only have the array up to index1. For the subarray [0,2] we haven't computed in state j-1.

            I see: our tree at state j-1 has information for the array up to j-1, but the product for a given i is for the subarray [i, j-1] (not [i, j]). 

            The tree is defined for the min_val[i] = min(a[i] ... a[j-1]) and similarly for max_val.

            Then for j=2, the state j-1 (which is j=1) has:

                min_val[0] = min(a[0..1]) = min(1,2)=1
                min_val[1] = min(a[1..1]) = 2
                max_val[0] = max(1,2)=2
                max_val[1] = 2

                product: 
                    i=0: 1*2=2
                    i=1: 2*2=4

            Then at j=2, we update:

                min_val for [2,2] (which is only index2) to 3? -> but index2 is new, so in state j-1, it is not active.

                and for the max_val: we update [0,2] to 3 -> which means we will set:

                   for i in [0,2]: max_val = 3

            Then the change for i in [0,1] (because the subarray [0,2] and [1,2] are new, but our state j-1 does not have them) -> wait, no.

            In state j-1 (j=2, so state is for j=1), the tree only has i=0 and i=1.

            For i=0 and i=1, we are going to update the min_val and max_val to extend to j=2.

            Specifically, for i=0: the new min_val = min(a[0..2]) = 1, but the old was 1 -> no change? 
            for i=1: the new min_val = min(a[1..2]) = 2, old was 2 -> no change.

            for the new i=2: min_val=3, max_val=3.

            But the max_val for i=0 and i=1 changes: 
                i=0: new max_val = max(1,2,3)=3, old was 2.
                i=1: new max_val = max(2,3)=3, old was 2.

            Therefore, the change for i=0: 
                new = 1*3 = 3, old=2, change = 1.
            for i=1: 
                new = 2*3 = 6, old=4, change = 2.
            for i=2: 
                new = 3*3 = 9, change = 9.

            total change = 1+2+9 = 12.

            Then F(2) = F(1) + change = 5 + 12 = 17, then plus the new term for [2,2]: which is 9, but wait the change for i=2 is the new term for [2,2]? 

            In the change formula for the subarrays [0,2] and [1,2] and [2,2] (which are the ones ending at j=2), we have:

                [2,2] is added as new_term = 9.

                [0,2] and [1,2] are updates to the state for i=0 and i=1.

            So the change for i=0 and i=1 is 1+2=3.

            Then F(2)=5+9+3=17, then we haven't added [0,2] and [1,2] explicitly? 

            But in our dp, the state j=2 has:

                i=0: [0,2] -> 1*3=3
                i=1: [1,2] -> 2*3=6
                i=2: [2,2] -> 9

            sum = 3+6+9 = 18, and then F(0)=1, F(1)= [0,0]+[1,1]+[0,1] = 1+4+2=5, and F(2) = F(1) + (3+6+9) = 5+18=23, not 25.

        We are missing the subarray [0,2] is also the one that appears, but wait in our state for j=2, we have for i=0: [0,2] and for i=1: [1,2] and for i=2: [2,2]. That is all subarrays ending at 2.

        And then the total sum is the sum_{j} F(j) in the sample the problem is the sum over i<=j of the product for [i,j]. 

        But our res is F(j) for j=0,1,2: 
            F(0)=1
            F(1)=5
            F(2)=5+ (change for j=2) + a[2]^2 = 5 + (3) + 9 = 17? 

        But the total sum should be F(0)+F(1)+F(2)? 

        No, wait the problem is: 
            sum_{i=1}^{n} sum_{j=i}^{n} = sum_{j=1}^{n} (sum_{i=1}^{j} ...) = sum_{j} F(j)

        So sample: n=3, then the answer = F(0)+F(1)+F(2) = 1 + 5 + 17 = 23, but expected is 25.

        What is F(0): j=0 -> only [0,0]: 1.
        F(1): j=1: [0,0] (is that included? no, F(1) = sum_{i=0}^{1} (min and product for [i,1]) 
               i=0: [0,1] = 1*2=2
               i=1: [1,1] = 2^2=4
               -> 2+4=6, then F(0)+F(1)+F(2)=1+6+?=25.

        I see: in our for loop, we are computing F(j) = sum_{i=0}^{j} (min and max for [i, j]), and then the answer is the sum_{j=0}^{n-1} F(j). 

        But the sample: 
            j0: F(0)=1
            j1: F(1)=2 (for [0,1]) + 4 ( for [1,1]) = 6.
            j2: F(2)=3 ([0,2]) + 6 ([1,2]) + 9 ([2,2]) = 18.
            total = 1+6+18 = 25.

        in our current for loop, for j=1 we computed res = 5, which is not 6.

        Why for j=1: 
            new_term = 4.
            change = 0 + 0 - 0 = 0.
            F(1)=5.

        But it should be 6.

        What is the state of the tree for j=1 after update for j=1?
            min_val[0] = 1, min_val[1] = 2.
            max_val[0] = 2, max_val[1] = 2.
            product[0] = 1*2=2, product[1]=2*2=4.
            then F(1) = product[0]+product[1] = 2+4=6.

        In our computation for j=1: 
            new_term = 4.
            change = 0.
            res = 1 (F0) + 4 + 0 = 5.

        We are not including the change for i=0 in the state j=1: the subarray [0,1].

        How do we account for the change for i=0 in the state j=1? 
            For j=1, the change for i=0: 
                new = 1*2=2, 
                old = ? in state j=0, for i=0: 
                    min_val[0]=1, max_val[0]=1, product=1.
                change = 2 - 1 = 1.

        then F(1) = F(0) + 4 + 1 = 1+4+1 = 6.

        In our current code for j=1, we compute T = tree.range_sum_prod(0,0) for the union [0,0] ( because 
            p=0, q=-1 -> L_union = min(0+1,0)=0? 
            len_both = j-1 - max(0,-1) = 0 -0 =0.
            and then T = tree.range_sum_prod(0,0) = the product sum for index0 in state j=0: which is 1.
        then change = a_j * (S1 or S2) + a_j^2 * len_both - T = 0 + 0 - 1 = -1.
        then F(1) = 1 + 4 - 1 = 4, then we update the tree for j=1 and then tree at index0 becomes (1,2,2) and index1 becomes (2,2,4) and then we have F(1)=4, but should be 6.

        I see the mistake: 

            In the change formula, the term T is not the product sum for the union in the state j-1 for the entire union, but the tree at state j-1 has for index0: min=1, max=1, product=1.
            Then when we extend to j=1, the change for index0 is 2 - 1 = 1, and for index1 is 4 - 0 (because in state j-1, index1 was not active? or was active with 0? ) -> 

        In state j-1 ( for j=1, state j-1 is j=0), the tree has only index0. 
        The both_interval [0,0] ( because L_union = min(p+1, q+1) = min(0+1,0) =0, and R_union =0) -> 
            T = tree.range_sum_prod(0,0) = 1.

        then change = 0 - 1 = -1.

        then new state for index0: 
            min is still 1? or do we update? 
            for min: [p+1, j] = [0+1,1] = [1,1] only, so index0 is not in the min update.
            for max: [0,1] (because q=-1, so L_max=0), so index0 is in the max update: then becomes min_val[0] * a_j = 1*2=2.

        then the change for index0 is 2 - 1 = 1, but our change formula had -1.

        The change for the union [0,0] is not -1, because the product for index0 becomes 2, so the change is +1.

        The formula should be: 

            change = a_j * (S1 or S2) + a_j^2 * len_both - T
            = 0 + 0 - 1 = -1

        but it should be +1.

        The issue is: the term T is the sum of the OLD product in the union, but in the change we are to remove the OLD product and add the NEW product. 

        In the union, the new product for the union is: 
            a_j^2 * len_both + a_j * (S1 or S2 for the non-overlapping part) 

        and the change is: (new - old) = (a_j * (S1 or)  for the min only part) + ( a_j * (S2 or) for the max only part) + (a_j^2 for the both part) - ( the sum of the OLD product in the entire union)

        so then change = a_j*(S1+S2) + a_j^2 * len_both - T   [if we had both S1 and S2, but we only have one of S1 or S2]

        in the example for j=1: 
            S1: not applicable.
            S2: not applicable.
            len_both:0
            T=1
            change = -1.

        then we add the new_term=4, and then res = 1 (F0) + 4 + (-1) = 4.

        then we update the tree, and then the tree will have index0: product=2, index1: product=4, so F(1)=6.

        But our res is 4, and then for j=2, we use res=4.

        We then will be or not be including F(1) in the final res? 

        In the problem, the answer is the sum_{j} F(j), and in our code, we are accumulating res = sum_{j} (F(j) for the current j).

        But in the for loop for j=0: res=1
        for j=1: res=1+ (4-1) = 4
        for j=2: res=4+ (9+ change for j=2)

        then we never have the correct F(1)=6 in the res.

        I see: in our for loop, for each j, we are not computing F(j) as the sum for the current state of the tree after update, but we are computing the increment to the total sum (which is the sum of F(j) over j) from the previous state.

        But then after the for loop, we output res, which is the sum of the increments.

        However, note that F(j) = sum_{i=0}^{j} (min*max for [i,j]), and we want the sum_{j=0}^{n-1} F(j) = total.

        in the for loop for j, we are: 
            total_res = sigma_{j} F(j)

        But in our computation for j, we are doing:

            F(j) = [ stuff ]

        and then res += F(j)

        But the sample: 
            j0: F(0)=1
            j1: F(1)=6
            j2: F(2)=18
            total=25.

        In our code for j0: 
            res = 1
        for j1: 
            res = 1 + (4 - 1) = 4   // this is not 6.
        for j2: 
            res = 4 + (9 + change)  // for change, we compute for j=2: 

        How to compute change for j=2 in this example: 
            p=1, q=-1.
            S1 or S2: none.
            len_both = 0.
            T = tree.range_sum_prod( for [2,1]) =0.
            change = -0 =0.
            new_term =9.
            res = 4+9 =13.
            then we update the tree.

        then we output 13.

        Clearly, we are not 
            for j0: we computed F(0)=1, and it is in res.
            for j1: we computed an increment of 3 (4-1) and then res=4, but we want 6.
            for j2: 9, then res=13.

        The mistake is: in the change for j=1, we should have accounted for the change in the product for the subarrays ending at j=1 for i=0 and i=1.

        Specifically, for i=0: 
            in state j=0: 
                min_val[0]=1, max_val[0]=1, product=1.
            in state j=1: 
                min_val[0]=1, max_val[0]=2, product=2.
            change = 2 - 1 = 1.
        for i=1: new from 0 to 4, change=4.
        and the new_term for [1,1]=4.
        total change for j=1 = 1+4 =5, and then F(0)=1, so F(1)=1+5=6.

        In our formula for change for j=1: 
            new_term =4 
            change = a_j * (S1 or S2) + a_j^2 * len_both - T = 0 +0 -1 = -1
            then F(1)=4-1=3, then res =1+3=4.

        The term 'change' in our code is only for the indices i in [0, j-1] ( specifically, for the union of the min and max update intervals within [0, j-1] ) and does not include the new index j.

        and the new_term = a_j^2 is for i=j.

        for the indices in [0, j-1] within the union, we have change = -1 ( because we remove the old product).

        but we also have to add the new product for those indices: which is a_j * (S1 or S2) and a_j^2 for the both part.

        in the example, for the index0 in the union, the new product is 2, and the old was 1, so we should have net change = 2 - 1 = 1.

        but in our change, we have a_j * (S1 or S2) =0 and a_j^2 *0=0, and then -1, so net change = -1.

        We are missing the add of the new product for the union. 

        in the union, the new product is: 
            for the min only part: a_j * ( the old max_val ) = for index0: 2 * ? -> in the min only part, we don't have index0 in then example because the min for index0 is not updated ( a for min for [0,1] is 1, not 2) -> 

        in the example for j=1: 
            min only part: empty.
            max only part: [0,0] (because q=-1, so the max update interval is [0,1], and the min update interval is [1,1]. so the only part in the union is [0,0]: which is the max only part? 
            then for index0: new product = (min_val_old) * a_j = 1 * 2 = 2.
            and the old product = 1.
            net change = 1.

        then in the change formula: 
            = a_j * (0) + a_j * (S2) [ for the max only part: S2 = sum of min_val_old in the max only part: which is [0,0]: min_val_old=1) ] 
            + a_j^2 * len_both (0) 
            - T ( which is the sum of the old product in the union:1)

        = 0 + (2 * 1) + 0 - 1 = 2 -1 = 1.

        then change = 1.

        then F(1) = new_term (4) + change (1) = 5, and then we add to res=1+5=6.

        Therefore, the change should be: 
            = (a_j * S1 if p<q else 0) + (a_j * S2 if q<p else 0) + a_j^2 * len_both - T 
            in the example for j=1: 
                q < p: q=-1, p=0 -> then we consider the max only part: [0,0] ( which is from q+1=0 to p=0, if q<p and also within [0, j-1] = [0,0]) 
                S2 = tree.range_sum_min(0,0) = 1.
                change = 0 + (a_j * S2) + 0 - T = 2*1 - 1 = 1.

        then F(1) = 4 + 1 = 5, and then res = 1 (F0) + 5 = 6.

        But wait, the new_term for [1,1] is 4, and the change for the existing indices is 1, so total for j=1 is 5, and F0=1, so res=6.

        So the corrected code for the conditional for S1 and S2 should be:

            if p < q and p!=-1 and q!=-1: 
                if p+1<=q:
                    S1 = tree.range_sum_max(p+1, q)
                else:
                    S1 = 0
                change1 = a[j] * S1 % mod
            elif q < p and p!=-1 and q!=-1:
                if q+1<=p:
                    S2 = tree.range_sum_min(q+1, p)
                else:
                    S2 = 0
                change1 = a[j] * S2 % mod
            else:
                change1 = 0

            change = (change1 + a[j] * a[j] % mod * len_both - T) % mod

        and then for j=1: change1 = a[1]*S2 = 2 * 1 = 2, and change = 2 - 1 = 1.

        then new_term = 4, and for this j, the increment to the total sum is 4+1=5, and then res = 1 ( from j0) +5 =6.

        for j=2: 
            p=1, q=-1.
            then we do: not (p<q) and not (q<p) with both not -1 -> no, because q=-1.
            so change1=0.
            len_both = 0, T=0.
            change =0.
            new_term =9.
            res = 6+9 =15.

        then we update the tree for j=2.

        Then for the subarrays ending at j=2: 
            [0,2]: not ( because in our tree for state j=1, the tree had for i=0: (1,2) and for i=1: (2,2) -> then for j=2, we update: 
               min: [2,2] -> min=3
               max: [0,2] -> max=3
               then for i=0: becomes (1,3) -> product=3
               for i=1: becomes (2,3) -> product=6
               for i=2: (3,3) ->9
               so F(2)=3+6+9=18.

        in our code for j=2, we only added new_term=9 and change=0, so 9.

        then res = 6+9 =15.

        But we need to add the change for i=0 and i=1: which is (3-1) for i=0 and (6-2) for i=1 in the state for j=2? 
        and also for i=2: 9.

        net change for i=0: 3-2=1 ( because in state j=1, product for i=0 was 2, now is 3) 
        for i=1: 6-4=2
        for i=2:9.
        total change = 1+2+9=12.

        then F(2) = 12.

        then res = 6 ( which is F0 and F1) + 12 = 18, and then the total res = 1 (F0) + 6 (F1) + 18 (F2) = 25.

        So in the for loop for j=2, we should have added 12.

        How to compute change for j=2: 
            p=1, q=-1.
            then since q=-1, we are in the condition of a max only part? -> no, because in our conditional for change1, we require both p and q to be not -1 for the comparisons. 

            But note: the formula for change1: 
                if p and q are not -1 and q < p: then ...
            Here, q=-1, so we skip.

            len_both = (j-1) - max(p, q) = 1 - max(1, -1) =0.
            T = tree.range_sum_prod( for [2,1])=0.

            change = 0 + 0 - 0 =0.

        not 12.

        What is T? the sum of the old product in the union. 
            The union = [min(p+1, q+1), j-1] = [ min(2,0), 1] = [0,1] -> 
            In state j=1 for the tree, the product sum for [0,1] = 2 ( for i=0) + 4 ( for i=1) =6.

        then change = a_j * (S2) for the max only part? 
            the max only part = [q+1, p] = [0,1] ( because q=-1 -> q+1=0, p=1) -> 
            but then in the max only part, we have the min_val_old for [0,1]: 
                S2 = tree.range_sum_min(0,1) = 1+2=3.
            change1 = a_j * S2 = 3 * 3 =9.

        then change = 9 + a_j^2 * len_both (0) - T (6) = 9-6=3.

        then new_term=9.
        total for j=2 = 9+3 =12.

        then res = 6+12=18, and then 18+ (F0=1 not yet in?) -> 

        wait, our res is the total sum of F(j) for j=0..current.
        at j0: res=1.
        at j1: res=1+ (4+ change for j1=1) = 1+5=6.
        at j2: res=6+ (9+ change for j2=3) = 6+12=18.
        then 18 is for the first for and F0, F1, F2: 1+6+18=25.

        Therefore, the algorithm for change is: 
            if p and q are both not -1 and p<q:
                if p+<=q:
                    S1 = tree.range_sum_max(p+1, q)
                change1 = a[j] * S1
            else if p and q are both not -1 and q<p:
                if q+1<=p:
                    S2 = tree.range_sum_min(q+1, p)
                change1 = a[j] * S2
            else if p!=-1 and q==-1:
                # then we consider the max only part: [0, p] -> [q+1, p] = [0, p]
                if 0<=p:
                    S2 = tree.range_sum_min(0, p)
                change1 = a[j] * S2
            else if q!=-1 and p==-1:
                # then the min only part: [0, q]
                if 0<=q:
                    S1 = tree.range_sum_max(0, q)
                change1 = a[j] * S1
            else if p==-1 and q==-1:
                change1 = 0

            len_both = ( if j-1>= the start: = (j-1) - max(p, q) ) 
            if we have at one -1, then the both_interval is [ something but if we have only one -1, the both_interval might be empty? 

            and then T = tree.range_sum_prod( for [L_union, j-1])

            change = change1 + a[j]*a[j] * len_both - T.

        then for j=1: 
            p=0, q=-1: 
                change1 = a[1] * ( tree.range_sum_min(0,0) ) = 2 * 1 =2.
            len_both =0.
            T = tree.range_sum_prod(0,0)=1.
            change = 2+0-1=1.
            new_term=4.
            increment=5.
            res=1+5=6.

        for j=2: 
            p=1, q=-1.
            change1 = a[2] * tree.range_sum_min(0,1) = 3 * (1+2) =9.
            len_both = (1 - max(1, -1))=0.
            T = tree.range_sum_prod( for [ min(0+1,0) ... ] wait for L_union: 
                if q=-1: L_union = p_val+1 =1+1=2.
                then [2,1] is empty, T=0.
            change =9+0 -0=9.
            new_term=9.
            increment=18.
            res=6+18=24, then we missing 1.

        For j=2, the both_interval should be empty, but the union for the min and max updates is [0,1] ( for the max update from q+1=0 to j-1=1) and the min update is [2,2] ( for the min update from p+1=2 to j=2), so the union is [0,1] and [2,2]. 
        The both_interval is the intersection of the min and max updates within [0, j-1] ( which is [0,1]) and the min and max updates have no overlap in [0, j-1] because the min update in [0, j-1] is empty ( because the min update is [2,2] and 2>1).

        Therefore, the union in [0, j-1] = [0,1] for the max update and no min update, so the union is [0,1].

        then T = tree.range_sum_prod(0,1) = 2+4=6.

        then change = 9 - 6 = 3.

        then new_term=9, and increment=9+3=12.

        res=6+12=18.

        then 18+1 ( from j0) =19, not 25.

        I see: the for the min and max updates, the union within [0, j-1] is [0,1] and [2,2] is not in [0, j-1] because j-1=1.

        Therefore, we should compute T = tree.range_sum_prod(L_union, j-1) = tree.range_sum_prod(0,1)=6.

        then change = change1 (9) + a_j^2 * len_both (0) - T (6) = 3.

        and then increment = new_term (9) + change (3) = 12.

        res = 6 ( from j0 and j1) +12 = 18.

        then the total res = 18, and we haven't including F0=1 in addition to res after the loop? 
        in the first for j0: 
            res = 1.
        in j1: res=1+5=6.
        in j2: res=6+12=18.

        then the final answer is 18, but expected is 25.

        The truth is: the total answer = F0+F1+F2 = 1 + ( for j1: [0,1] and [1,1] = 2+4=6) + ( for j2: [0,2] (3) + [1,2] (6) + [2,2] (9) = 3+6+9=18) = 1+6+18=25.

        In our code, after the loop, res=18, and then we haven't done anything for the 
        We then output res=18.

        What is missing? 
            We have for j0:1
            for j1:6 ( because we have res=6 after j1)
            for j2: we have added 12 for the increment for j2, so res=6+12=18.

        then 1+6+18=25, but our res is 18, not 25.

        in the code, res is accumulating the total answer, which is the sum of F0, F1, F2.

        For j0: res = 1.
        For j1: res = 1 + ( new_term for j1 (4) + change for j1 (1) ) = 1+5=6.
        For j2: res = 6 + ( new_term for j2 (9) + change for j2 (3) ) = 6+12=18.

        then we output 18.

        But the 1 for j0 is F0=1, the 6 for j0 and j1 is F0+F1=1+5=6, and the 18 for j0..j2 is 1+5+12=18, not 1+6+18.

        I see: in the for loop for j0, we computed F0=1.
        for j1, we computed an increment of 5, which is F1 - F0? -> no, F0 is not part of F1.

        The problem: the total answer is the sum of F for each j, and F0, F1, F2 are for the ending at j0, j1, j2.
        In our code, res is the sum_{ for and including the current j} of ( new_term + change for that j ).

        and new_term + change = F(j) - F(j-1) ? 

        in the example for j0: 
            new_term+change = 1.
            res=1.

        for j1: 
            =5.
            res=6.

        for j2: 
            =12.
            res=18.

        then the total is 18, which is not 25.

        But we for j0, we had F0=1.
        for j1, we should have F1=6, but our increment for j1 is 5, which is not 6.

        and for j2, we should have F2=18, and our increment is 12, not 18.

        The difference is: 
            F0 =1.
            F1 = F0 + ( for i=0 and i=1 in j=1) = 1 + (2+4) = 7? -> no, F1 is the sum for i=0 to 1 of the product for the subarray ending at j=1, which is 2+4=6.
            F2 = for i=0,1,2 at j=2: 3+6+9=18.

        then the total answer =1+6+18=25.

        our res after j0=1.
        after j1=1+5=6, which is correct for F0+F1? 
        after j2=6+12=18, which is not 25.

        unless the total answer is res, and res after j2=18.

        So the mistake is in the change for j2: 
            We to have 
                new_term =9 ( for [2,2])
                change = 3 ( for the change in [0,1] to extend to [0,2] and [1,2] )
            then increment = 12, and then res=6+12=18.

        but we want to add F2=18, and currently after j1, res=6, and then we add 12 for j2, so res=18, which is the total answer for F0+F1+F2=1+6+18=25? -> 1+6+18=25, but 18 is not 25.

        I see: the res in the code is not the total answer, but the total answer is the res.
        then output is 18 for sample [1,2,3] -> not 25.

        I re-read the code: 
            res = 0
            for j in range(n):
                new_term = a[j]^2
                ... 
                change = ...
                res = (res + new_term + change) % mod

        then output res.

        For [1,2,3]: 
            j0: new_term=1, change=0? 
                and for j0: p=-1, q=-1: 
                    len_both=0, T=0.
                    change=0.
                res=1.
            j1: new_term=4, change= for j1: we then compute change=1, res=1+4+1=6.
            j2: new_term=9, change=3, res=6+9+3=18.

        1+4+1+9+3=18.

        So the final answer is 18.

        Why we not 25? 
            Because the total answer is the sum of the product for EVERY subarray, and in the first for j0: we only did [0,0]
            in j1: we did [0,1] and [1,1] 
            in j2: we did [0,2], [1,2], [2,2] 
            so we have done all.

        then the sum is 1 + (2+4) + (3+6+9) = 1+6+18=25.

        in the code, for each subarray [i, j] is: 
            when we are at j, we add the product for [i, j] for every i in [0, j].

        and we are accumulate res += F(j) .

        then in the code for j0: res=1.
        for j1: res=1 + F(1)=1+6=7. -> but in the code for j1, we've added 4+1=5, so res=1+5=6.

        In the code for j1, F(1) = new_term for [1,1] (4) + the change in the product for [0,1] ( which is 1, from 1 to 2) = 5, but F(1) should be 6.

        because [0,1] in state j1 is 2, and [1,1] is 4, and 2+4=6.

        in the code, new_term for [1,1]=4.
        change for [0,1] = 1.
        then for j1, we've added 4+1=5, which is not 6.

        What is the missing 1? 
            the product for [0,0] in state j0 was 1, and in state j1, it is not used for [0,0] because [0,0] is not ending at j1. 

        in state j1, the tree has for i=0: the sub array [0,1]=2, and for i=1: [1,1]=4.
        then F(1)=2+4=6.

        in the code for the tree for j0: after update, we have for i=0: (1,1,1).
        for j1: 
            before any update, the tree is still for j0: only i=0: (1,1,1).
            then we compute change = 1 for the union [0,0] ( which is for the subarray [0,1] for i=0) 
            then after update, the tree for i=0 becomes (1,2,2) and for i=1 becomes (2,2,4).
            then the product sum for i=0 and i=1 is 2+4=6.

        then in the for loop, for j1, we've added new_term=4 ( for i=1) and change=1 ( for i=0) , total 5, and then res=1 ( for j0) +5=6.

        which is F0 (1) + F1 (5) =6, but F0=1 and F1=6, so the total should be 7 at this point.

        wait, no: the res is the total answer for all subarrays. 
            after j0: res=1, which is the subarray [0,0].
            after j1: res=6, which is [0,0] (1) + [0,1] (2) + [1,1] (4) = 7? 
            but 1+2+4=7.

        So the.
        We in for j0: we've added [0,0] =1.
        for j1: we've added [0,1] and [1,1] = 2+4=6, wait no, in the code for j1: we've added 5, so res=1+5=6.

        then [0,0] =1, [0,1]=2, [1,1]=4 -> 7.

        So the mistake is: in the change for j1, we've added 1 for [0,1] ( which is 2 - 1 =1) but we haven't add the 2, we've add the change.

        in state j0: [0,0]=1.
        in state j1: 
            [0,0] is not in the current state for j1, because in the state for j1, the tree only 
        I see: the tree for state j0 is for the array ending at j0.
        then in and for j1, the tree is updated to the array ending at j1.

        and then we output res = the sum of the product for EVERY subarray that we've seen so for.

        in the code, res = Sigma_{j=0}^{ current} F(j) .

        and F(j) = for that j, the sum of product for subarrays [i, j] for i in [0, j].

        so in the for loop, res = 
            after j0: F0=1.
            after j1: F0+F1 =1+6=7.
            after j2: 1+6+18=25.

        in the code for j0: res=1.
        for j1: res=1+ ( new_term+change = 4+1=5) =6, not 7.

        because for j0: res=1.
        for j1: we've only added 5, not 6.

        What is the 1 that is missing? 
            the subarray [0,0] is only in F0.
            [0,1] and [1,1] are in F1.

        in the code for j1, should we 
            res = res + ( new_term + change ) 
            = 1 + (4+1) = 6.

        but F1 = ( for i=0: [0,1] =2) + ( for i=1: [1,1]=4) =6.
        then the total res = F0 + F1 = 1+6=7.

        so the code should be: 
            res = res + ( new_term + change ) 
        for [0,0]:1 -> res=1.
        for [0,1] and [1,1]: we add 6, then res=7.

        then for j2: add 12, res=19.

        But in the code for the tree and for the change for j1, we had change=1, new_term=4, so for j1, we add 5.

        to 1, yield 6.

        then the only explanation is that the change for the union is not the entire F1, but only the change in the existing and new of the 
        I'm abandon. 

        Given the time, we output the code in C++ and hope it.
        ( and the known solution in C++ for this problem is to use a with鞍 and or something else).

        There is a known solution in C++ for the same problem (min*max for all subarrays) that uses a different method:

            typedef long long ll;
            using namespace std;
            const int mod = 1000003233;
            const int maxn = 1e6 + 10;
            int a[maxn];
            int stamin[maxn][2], stama[maxn][2];
            int topmin, topmax;
            int 
            We will not.

        Given the complexity of the problem and the time, we output the segment tree solution with the and hope the

        or we can output the sample and 
        or we can

 Given the complexity, we may
