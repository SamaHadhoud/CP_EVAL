To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum damage that can be dealt by a combination spell, which is the bitwise XOR of spells chosen from each spellcaster's available spells (0 to \(a_i\) for the \(i\)-th spellcaster). The solution involves two key insights: the maximum possible XOR value is the bitwise OR of all \(a_i\) values, and we can construct an assignment of spells to achieve this maximum value.

### Approach
1. **Compute Maximum Damage (T)**: The maximum possible XOR value, \(T\), is the bitwise OR of all \(a_i\) values. This is because the XOR operation can only set a bit in the result if at least one number in the corresponding sets has that bit set, and the bitwise OR of all \(a_i\) values ensures the highest value where each bit is set if present in any \(a_i\).

2. **Construct Assignment (x_i)**: For each bit position from 0 to 60 (since \(a_i\) can be up to \(10^{18}\)), if the bit is set in \(T\), collect all spellcasters (indices) that can set this bit (i.e., \(a_i\) has this bit set). Ensure the number of selected spellcasters for this bit is odd (to set the bit in the XOR result). If the initial list of indices has even length, remove one index (e.g., the last one) to make it odd. Set this bit in the chosen spells of the selected spellcasters.

### Solution Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int C;
    cin >> C;
    while (C--) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        vector<long long> a(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cin >> a[i];
        }
        long long T = 0;
        for (long long num : a) {
            T |= num;
        }

        vector<long long> x(n, 0);

        for (int j = 0; j <= 60; j++) {
            long long mask = 1LL << j;
            if (T & mask) {
                vector<int> indices;
                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                    if (a[i] & mask) {
                        indices.push_back(i);
                    }
                }
                if (indices.size() % 2 == 0) {
                    if (!indices.empty()) {
                        indices.pop_back();
                    }
                }
                for (int idx : indices) {
                    x[idx] |= mask;
                }
            }
        }

        cout << T << endl;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cout << x[i];
            if (i < n-1) {
                cout << " ";
            }
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, we read the number of spellcasters \(n\) and their respective maximum spell values \(a_i\).
2. **Computing Maximum Damage (T)**: The bitwise OR of all \(a_i\) values gives \(T\), the maximum possible XOR result.
3. **Constructing Assignment (x_i)**:
   - Initialize each spellcaster's spell \(x_i\) to 0.
   - For each bit position (0 to 60), check if the bit is set in \(T\).
   - If set, collect indices of spellcasters whose \(a_i\) has this bit set.
   - Ensure the number of selected indices is odd (remove the last index if even).
   - Set the bit in the chosen spells of the selected indices.
4. **Output**: For each test case, output \(T\) (the maximum damage) and the constructed assignment \(x_i\) (the spells each spellcaster should cast).

This approach efficiently computes the maximum damage by leveraging bit manipulation properties and constructs a valid assignment by ensuring each bit in the result is set by an odd number of spellcasters, while respecting each spellcaster's spell constraints. The solution handles large input sizes within feasible time complexity due to bit-level operations and linear passes over the input.
