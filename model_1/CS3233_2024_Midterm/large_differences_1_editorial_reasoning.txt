We are given an integer N and a list H of N integers (heights). We need to find the maximum possible value of X such that there exists a permutation of the heights where the minimum absolute difference between adjacent elements is at least X. In other words, we want the maximum X for which we can arrange the objects so that every adjacent pair has a difference of at least X.

Note: The problem is equivalent to finding the maximum value of the minimum adjacent difference over all permutations.

Key Insight:
This problem is similar to the "Maximum Minimum Adjacent Difference" problem. However, note that we are allowed to permute arbitrarily. The challenge is to maximize the minimum gap.

A common approach for such problems is to use binary search on the answer X. We can ask: "Is there a permutation such that every adjacent pair has a difference at least X?" If we can answer this question for a given X, then we can binary search for the maximum X.

However, note that the constraints: N up to 500,000 and H_i up to 10^9. We need an efficient way to check for a fixed X.

But note: the problem of checking for a fixed X is non-trivial. Alternatively, we can use a constructive greedy method or known combinatorial techniques.

Another Insight:
Consider sorting the array. Then note that the maximum possible X cannot exceed the maximum gap between consecutive elements in the sorted array? Actually, it might be larger? Let's think:

In fact, the maximum X we can get is bounded by the overall range of the array divided by the number of "gaps" we have to cover? Not exactly.

But note: In the sorted array, the gaps between consecutive elements are critical. However, we are allowed to rearrange arbitrarily. We can use a strategy of placing numbers in an order that alternates between low and high? Actually, a well-known approach for similar problems (like the "Maximum Minimum Distance" in arranging numbers) is to use a "two pointers" method after sorting and then try to form a chain.

However, a more direct method is known: we can use a greedy construction that builds a sequence by repeatedly taking the next element that is at least X away from the last one. But that might be too slow and not necessarily yield the entire permutation.

Alternatively, we can use graph theory: consider a graph where each number is a node and an edge exists if |a-b|>=X. Then we are asking for a Hamiltonian path. But this is NP-hard and not feasible for N=500000.

Thus, we must avoid building such a graph.

Known similar problem: "Frog Jumping" or "Maximum Minimum Distance" in a sorted array.

Actually, we can use a different idea: the maximum possible X must be one of the gaps in the sorted array? Not necessarily: but note that if we have duplicates, then we can only achieve X=0? But if we have distinct numbers, then the gaps in the sorted array are important.

But observe: the problem asks for the maximum X such that the entire permutation has adjacent differences at least X. How can we achieve a large X? We can try to interlace the numbers. For example, we can arrange the numbers in an order: first the smallest, then the largest, then the next smallest, then the next largest, etc. This is the "greedy" zig-zag arrangement. However, is this optimal for maximizing the minimum adjacent difference?

Let's test with the samples:

Sample 1: [2, 6, 10, 2] -> sorted: [2,2,6,10]
If we arrange: 2, 10, 2, 6 -> adjacent differences: |2-10|=8, |10-2|=8, |2-6|=4 -> min=4.

But if we arrange: 2, 6, 2, 10 -> differences: |2-6|=4, |6-2|=4, |2-10|=8 -> min=4.

Is there an arrangement with min>=5? We need every adjacent pair to have at least 5. But we have two 2's. The two 2's must be separated by at least one number. The numbers we have: 2,2,6,10. The two 2's cannot be adjacent (because then min=0). So we must have the two 2's not adjacent. The only way to separate them is to put numbers in between. The gaps between 2 and 6 is 4, and 2 and 10 is 8. But if we try to arrange: 2, 10, 6, 2 -> differences: 8, 4, 4 -> min=4. So 4 is the maximum.

But how did we get 4? It turns out that 4 is the gap between 2 and 6? Actually, in sorted order: [2,2,6,10] and the gaps: 0, 4, 4. The maximum X we can achieve is limited by the gaps that we must "jump" in the sorted order? Actually, note that we have two 2's: we can only use one 2 to jump to 10 (which gives 8) but then we must use the other 2 to connect to 6 (which gives 4) and then 6 to the other 2 (which gives 4). So the minimum becomes 4.

So the idea: we can use a two-pointer method to build a permutation that alternates between the lower and higher parts. But we must also account for duplicates.

Actually, there is a known solution for this problem: we sort the array, and then we can form two separate chains: one starting from the smallest and the other starting from the largest? But note, we only need one chain (the permutation). However, we can use a greedy method:

Step 1: sort the array.
Step 2: we can try to split the array into two halves: the lower half and the upper half. Then we interleave them. But we have to be cautious: the minimum adjacent difference might be the gap between the last element of the lower half and the first element of the upper half? Actually, in the interleaved arrangement, the adjacent pairs are between an element from the lower half and one from the upper half. The smallest gap between the lower half and the upper half is the gap between the largest in the lower half and the smallest in the upper half.

But what if we have duplicates? Then we might have to put duplicates in the same half? Actually, we can also distribute duplicates arbitrarily? However, note that we can also use a different arrangement.

Alternatively, we can use the following known method for the "maximum minimum adjacent difference" problem:

1. Sort the array: let A[0..n-1] be sorted.
2. Then, we can build an array B by taking the smallest element, then the largest, then the second smallest, then the second largest, etc. But then we break when we get to the middle? However, this arrangement might not be optimal when n is even or odd.

But let's try with sample 2: [2, 6, 7, 3, 8] -> sorted: [2,3,6,7,8]
Using the method: 
   B0 = 2
   B1 = 8
   B2 = 3
   B3 = 7
   B4 = 6
Then the adjacent differences: |2-8|=6, |8-3|=5, |3-7|=4, |7-6|=1 -> min=1 -> not 4.

That is not the sample output (which is 4). So that arrangement is bad.

Alternatively, we can try to arrange as: 
   Start at 2, then 6, then 3, then 7, then 8? 
   Differences: |2-6|=4, |6-3|=3, |3-7|=4, |7-8|=1 -> min=1.

Another known arrangement is the "rearrange array in maximum minimum form" (which is used for maximizing the minimum adjacent difference in a different way). But that problem is different.

Alternatively, we can use the following approach: we note that the answer must be at most the maximum gap between consecutive elements in the sorted array? Actually, no: because we can skip some elements and then use them later? But we have to use every element.

Actually, the problem is equivalent to the "Maximum Minimum k-spacing" in a tour? 

But note: we are allowed to arrange arbitrarily. The key is that the entire set of numbers must be traversed in a path such that each step is at least X. This is similar to the Hamiltonian path condition but we are allowed to choose the order arbitrarily.

We can use the following insight: if we consider the numbers as nodes and we connect two numbers if their difference is at least X, then we want a Hamiltonian path. However, as mentioned, this is NP-hard.

But note: the numbers are on a line (we can sort). In the sorted order, we can only jump from one number to another that is at least X away. Then we can use dynamic programming? But the state would be the set of used numbers? That is 2^N, which is too high.

We need a different approach.

Another idea: we can use a greedy algorithm that starts at a point and then repeatedly moves to the next available point that is at least X away. But we have to use all points. This greedy might get stuck.

But we can use two pointers? Actually, we can use a circular buffer? 

Alternatively, we can use a binary search on X and then check whether we can form such a permutation.

How to check for a fixed X?
  We want to know if there is a permutation of the array such that for every adjacent pair (a, b), |a-b|>=X.

We can use the following greedy idea (with sorting):

  Step 1: sort the array.
  Step 2: we try to form two chains: one starting from the smallest element and one starting from the largest? Actually, we can use a matching strategy.

But note: the problem of checking if we can arrange the array so that every adjacent pair has at least X difference is equivalent to: we can arrange the array without any two consecutive numbers (in the sorted order) being adjacent in the permutation? Actually, not exactly: because we can have gaps.

But we can use a greedy matching: we can try to assign the numbers to positions in an order that alternates between the lower and upper parts. However, we must use all numbers.

Actually, we can use a graph that is an interval graph? The numbers are on the real line and we can move from a number a to any number that is at least a+X away. We want to know if there is a Hamiltonian path. This is still NP-hard in general? But note: we have the numbers sorted and we can use the structure.

We can use a greedy algorithm that traverses the sorted array and "jumps" over blocks? Specifically, we can use a two-pointer method to simulate the chain.

But note: we can also use the following known solution for a similar problem (from codeforces or topcoder):

  We can use a greedy matching: 
    Let A be sorted.
    We can try to form a path by starting at the smallest element. Then we must jump to the next element that is at least X away. Then we jump again. But if we get stuck, we can try to backtrack? That would be exponential.

Alternatively, we can use a matching in a bipartite graph? But that would be O(n^2) and too slow.

Another idea: we can use a greedy algorithm that uses a deque: 
  - sort the array.
  - put the smallest element at the front.
  - then repeatedly: 
        if the next element (from the remaining) is at least X away from the last element in the front, then put it at the front?
        else if it is at least X away from the last element in the back, then put it at the back?
        else, we cannot form the chain.

But is that sufficient? 

Example: sorted array [1, 2, 3, 4] and X=2.
  Start: [1]
  Then next element: 2 -> |1-2|=1 < 2 -> cannot put at front. Then try to put at back: but the back is also 1 -> same. Then we try to skip? But we must use all.

Actually, we can try to put the largest element at the back? Then we have [1,4] -> then we have 2 and 3: 
   Now, we have to put 2: at front: |2-1|=1 -> fails; at back: |2-4|=2 -> okay: then [1,4,2] -> then 3: 
        front: |3-1|=2 -> okay? Then [3,1,4,2]. Then the adjacent pairs: |3-1|=2, |1-4|=3, |4-2|=2 -> min=2.

But the above greedy with a deque: 
  Start: [1]
  Then we take the largest (4) and put at back: [1,4]
  Then the next largest? But we have two left: 2 and 3. We can take 3: 
        at front: |3-1|=2 -> okay -> [3,1,4]
  Then 2: 
        at front: |2-3|=1 -> fails; at back: |2-4|=2 -> okay -> [3,1,4,2] -> works.

But what if we take the next smallest instead? 
  After [1,4], we take 2: 
        at front: |2-1|=1 -> fails; at back: |2-4|=2 -> okay -> [1,4,2]
        then 3: 
            front: |3-1|=2 -> okay -> [3,1,4,2] -> same.

So the greedy: 
  sort A
  initialize a deque dq
  We'll use two pointers: left=0, right=n-1
  We can choose the order of processing: we want to avoid getting stuck. One common strategy is to start with the smallest and then the largest? Then alternate.

But note: we can also start with the largest? 

Actually, the algorithm for the "rearrange array in alternating high-low" doesn't work here.

But the above deque method: 
  We start by pushing A[0] to the deque? Then we have to choose: we can push from the front or the back.

But we can do:

  dq = deque()
  dq.append(A[0])
  left = 1, right = n-1
  Then for i in range(1, n):
      if i % 2 == 1:   # or we can choose conditionally
          candidate1 = A[right]  # the largest remaining
          candidate2 = A[left]   # the smallest remaining
          # We have two choices: we can try to put the largest at the back? but we have two options: at the front or at the back.

  Actually, we can do:

      Check the differences if we put the largest remaining at the back of the deque: 
          diff1 = |candidate1 - dq.back()| 
      Check the differences if we put the smallest remaining at the front of the deque:
          diff2 = |candidate2 - dq.front()|

      But note: we also have the option to put the largest at the front and the smallest at the back? Actually, we have four options? 

  Alternatively, we can try both: we can try to put the largest at the back if it works (>=X) or if not, then try the largest at the front? or the smallest at the back? or the smallest at the front.

  However, we have to pick one element per step. And we have two choices: take from the left or from the right.

  We can try:

      Option1: take from the right and put at the back: 
          if |A[right] - dq.back()| >= X, then we can put A[right] at the back and right--.
      Option2: if not, then try taking from the right and put at the front: 
          if |A[right] - dq.front()| >= X, then we put A[right] at the front and right--.
      Option3: if not, then try taking from the left and put at the back: 
          if |A[left] - dq.back()| >= X, then we put A[left] at the back and left++.
      Option4: if not, then try taking from the left and put at the front: 
          if |A[left] - dq.front()| >= X, then we put A[left] at the front and left++.
      If none works, then we fail.

But is this greedy? And will it work? 

Example: [1,2,3,4], X=2: 
  Start: dq=[1]
  Step1: we are going to take from the right: A[right]=4.
      Option1: |4-1|>=2 -> true -> dq becomes [1,4] (we put at back) -> then right=2 (so left=1, right=2)
  Step2: now we have two elements: 2 and 3. We try from the right (which is 3) first.
      Option1: |3-4|=1 <2 -> fails.
      Option2: |3-1|=2>=2 -> so we put 3 at front: dq = [3,1,4] -> then right=1 (so now left=1, right=1: so the remaining is A[1]=2)
  Step3: now we have 2. We try from the right (which is 2) -> but we can also take from the left (same element).
      Option1: put 2 at back: |2-4|=2>=2 -> okay -> dq = [3,1,4,2] -> done.

This works.

But what if we have duplicates? 

Sample1: [2,2,6,10] (sorted) and X=4.
  Start: dq = [2] (the first element, A[0]=2)
  Step1: take the largest (10) -> 
        Option1: |10-2|>=4 -> yes -> dq = [2,10] -> then the array has [2,6] (left=1, right=2)
  Step2: take the largest (6) -> 
        Option1: |6-10|=4>=4 -> yes -> put at back: dq=[2,10,6] -> then we have 2 left (at index1)
  Step3: take the 2 -> 
        Option1: |2-6|=4>=4 -> yes -> put at back: [2,10,6,2] -> done.

But what if we try X=5? 
  Step1: [2,10] -> okay (|2-10|=8>=5)
  Step2: we have 2 and 6. 
        Option1: put 6 at back: |6-10|=4<5 -> fail.
        Option2: put 6 at front: |6-2|=4<5 -> fail.
        Then try the smallest (which is 2) -> 
            Option3: put 2 at back: |2-10|=8>=5 -> okay? Then we get [2,10,2] -> then we have 6 left.
            Then for 6: 
                Option1: put 6 at back: |6-2|=4<5 -> fail.
                Option2: put 6 at front: |6-2|=4<5 -> fail. 
            So fails.

  Then we try the smallest (2) in step2:
        Option3: put 2 at back: |2-10|=8>=5 -> then dq=[2,10,2] -> then we have 6 -> fails as above.

  Alternatively, at step2: we try the smallest at the front: 
        |2-2|=0<5 -> fails.

  So we cannot form a permutation for X=5.

Thus, the greedy with deque can be used for a fixed X. 

But note: the problem is to maximize X. And we are going to binary search on X. The possible X range: from 0 to max(H)-min(H). 

However, note that the answer X must be an integer and we are to output an integer.

Algorithm for fixed X:

  sort A
  dq = deque()
  dq.append(A[0])
  left = 1
  right = n-1
  while left <= right:
      if we can put A[right] at the back (i.e., |A[right] - dq.back()| >= X) then do that and right--.
      else if we can put A[right] at the front (|A[right] - dq.front()| >= X) then do that and right--.
      else if we can put A[left] at the back (|A[left] - dq.back()| >= X) then do that and left++.
      else if we can put A[left] at the front (|A[left] - dq.front()| >= X) then do that and left++.
      else break (and return false)

  if we used all elements, then return true.

But note: what if we start from the largest element? Maybe that leads to a solution when starting from the smallest fails? 

Actually, we should try both starting from the smallest and the largest? Because sometimes one might work and the other might not? 

But the problem: we are building a path. The starting point matters. So we might need to try two different starting points: the smallest and the largest? 

However, the problem says: we can choose any permutation. So we can start anywhere. Therefore, we should try:

  Option A: start with the smallest.
  Option B: start with the largest.

But what if we start with the median? It might be too expensive to try many.

But note: the greedy we described is very specific. It might be that starting with the smallest fails but starting with the largest works? 

Example: [1, 3, 5] and X=2.
  Start with smallest (1):
        Step1: put 5 at back: [1,5] -> then 3: 
            put 3 at back: |3-5|=2 -> okay -> [1,5,3] -> adjacent: 1->5:4, 5->3:2 -> min=2 -> works.
        Alternatively, at step1: put 5 at front: [5,1] -> then 3: 
            put 3 at front: |3-5|=2 -> [3,5,1] -> adjacent: 3->5:2, 5->1:4 -> min=2 -> also works.

  Now start with largest (5):
        Step1: we have [5]
        Then we can take 1: 
            at back: |1-5|=4>=2 -> [5,1] -> then 3: 
                at back: |3-1|=2 -> [5,1,3] -> works.
            or at front: |1-5|=4 -> [1,5] -> then 3: same as above.

But what if we have an even number? 

We'll try both starting points: smallest and largest. If either greedy works, then X is achievable.

But note: what about starting in the middle? The problem is that we don't know the best start. However, starting at an extreme (smallest or largest) is a common trick in greedy path building.

Therefore, we can do:

  check(X):
      if n==1: true? but n>=2.

      Try with the smallest as the start:
          dq = deque([A[0]])
          left=1, right=n-1
          ... (as above)

      if we used all, return true.

      Otherwise, try with the largest as the start:
          dq = deque([A[n-1]])
          left=0, right=n-2
          ... same procedure: but now we have to take from the remaining: from 0 to n-2.

      if we used all, return true.

      Otherwise, return false.

But wait: in the second trial (starting with the largest), we have the entire array except the last element? Then we proceed.

But what about the order of the remaining array? We have sorted A, and we are taking from the two ends: the smallest and largest that remain.

Why two starts? Because we want to have the chain start at the smallest or the largest to maximize the chance of having large gaps.

But note: what if we start at the second smallest? It might be that the smallest is only close to the second smallest? 

However, the greedy we are using always takes from the two ends (the smallest and largest available). So by starting at an extreme, we are covering the endpoints. 

But what if we start at an arbitrary point? We would have to consider all starting points? That is O(n) which is too expensive.

But note: the problem constraints (n=500000) and we are going to binary search over X (which is in the range [0, 10^9]), and for each X we do two O(n) checks. So the total time would be O(n * log(10^9)) = 500000 * 30 = 15e6, which is acceptable.

However, we must be cautious: the greedy algorithm for each check is O(n). We do two per X. And we do about O(log(max(H))) iterations (about 30). So total operations: 2 * 30 * n = 60 * 500000 = 30e6, which is acceptable.

But is the greedy with two starts sufficient? 

Consider the following: 
  We have an array: [1, 3, 5, 7] and X=2.
  Starting at 1: 
        dq=[1]
        then we can take 7: at back -> [1,7] -> then take 3: 
            3 at back: |3-7|=4>=2 -> [1,7,3] -> then 5: 
                5 at back: |5-3|=2 -> [1,7,3,5] -> min adjacent: |1-7|=6, |7-3|=4, |3-5|=2 -> min=2 -> works.

  Starting at 7: 
        dq=[7]
        then take 1: at back: [7,1] -> then take 5: 
            5 at back: |5-1|=4>=2 -> [7,1,5] -> then 3: 
                3 at back: |3-5|=2 -> [7,1,5,3] -> works.

But what if we have a more complex example? 

  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and X=3.
  Start at 1:
        dq=[1]
        then take 6: at back -> [1,6] -> 
        then we have [2,3,4,5]
        Now we take 5: 
            at back: |5-6|=1 -> fail
            at front: |5-1|=4>=3 -> so [5,1,6] -> 
        then take 2: 
            at back: |2-6|=4>=3 -> [5,1,6,2] -> 
        then take 4: 
            at back: |4-2|=2<3 -> fail
            at front: |4-5|=1<3 -> fail -> fails.
        Then try after [5,1,6] we take 4? 
            Actually, we have two choices: take from the right (which is 5? we already took 5) -> now the next largest is 4? 
            But our algorithm takes either the smallest remaining (2) or the largest remaining (4) at each step. So we took 5 first (the largest) and then 2 (the smallest). Now we have 3 and 4.

        But we can take 4: 
            at back: |4-2|=2 -> fail? 
            at front: |4-5|=1 -> fail.

        Then we try after [5,1,6] we take 3? 
            We have 2,3,4: the smallest is 2 and the largest is 4.
            So we try 4: 
                at back: |4-6|=? -> but 6 is the last in the back? Actually, the deque is [5,1,6] -> back=6, front=5.
                So we try 4 at back: |4-6|=2<3 -> fail.
                at front: |4-5|=1<3 -> fail.

        Then try 3: 
            at back: |3-6|=3>=3 -> so we put 3 at back: [5,1,6,3] -> then we have 2 and 4.
            Then we take 4: 
                at back: |4-3|=1 -> fail
                at front: |4-5|=1 -> fail.

        Then we try 2: 
            at back: |2-6|=? -> but we don't have 6 at the back anymore? the deque is [5,1,6,3] -> back=3, front=5.
            put 2 at back: |2-3|=1 -> fail.
            at front: |2-5|=3 -> okay -> [2,5,1,6,3] -> then we have 4.
            Then put 4: 
                at back: |4-3|=1 -> fail
                at front: |4-2|=2<3 -> fail.

        So fails.

  Now start at 6:
        dq=[6]
        then take 1: at back: [6,1] -> 
        then we have [2,3,4,5]
        take 5: 
            at back: |5-1|=4>=3 -> [6,1,5] -> 
        then take 2: 
            at back: |2-5|=3>=3 -> [6,1,5,2] -> 
        then take 4: 
            at back: |4-2|=2<3 -> fail
            at front: |4-6|=2<3 -> fail -> fails.

        Then after [6,1,5] we take 4? (the largest remaining) -> 
            at back: |4-5|=1 -> fail
            at front: |4-6|=2<3 -> fail.

        Then take 3? 
            at back: |3-5|=2<3 -> fail
            at front: |3-6|=3>=3 -> [3,6,1,5] -> 
            then we have 2 and 4.
            Then take 4: 
                at back: |4-5|=1 -> fail
                at front: |4-3|=1 -> fail -> fails.

        Then take 3 at back? 
            [6,1,5,3] -> then 2 and 4: 
                take 4: 
                    at back: |4-3|=1 -> fail
                    at front: |4-6|=2<3 -> fail.

        Then take 2: 
            at back: |2-3|=1 -> fail
            at front: |2-6|=4>=3 -> [2,6,1,5,3] -> then 4: 
                at back: |4-3|=1 -> fail
                at front: |4-2|=2<3 -> fail.

        So fails.

But we know that an arrangement for X=3 is possible? 
  How about: [1,4,2,5,3,6] -> 
      |1-4|=3, |4-2|=2 -> fails at 2.

  Or: [2,5,1,4,3,6] -> 
      |2-5|=3, |5-1|=4, |1-4|=3, |4-3|=1 -> fails.

  Actually, is there an arrangement? 
      We have 1,2,3,4,5,6 and we require every adjacent pair to have at least 3.

  Consider: 3, 6, 2, 5, 1, 4 -> 
      |3-6|=3, |6-2|=4, |2-5|=3, |5-1|=4, |1-4|=3 -> min=3 -> works.

How did we get that? It starts with 3 (which is in the middle). 

Therefore, our greedy that only starts at the extremes might fail. 

So what now? We need a more robust check for a fixed X.

Alternative approach for checking fixed X:

  We can use a graph that is an interval graph: we can only move from a number to a number that is at least X away. Since the numbers are sorted, we can use a two-pointer to precompute the next and previous jumps.

  But then we need to know if there is a Hamiltonian path. This is still NP-hard? However, the graph is an interval graph? Actually, the graph is the complement of a union of intervals? 

  Actually, the graph has an edge between two distinct vertices i and j if |A[i]-A[j]|>=X. This is not an interval graph. But note: the numbers are on a line. The condition for an edge is that the two numbers are at least X apart. This is the complement of the graph where edges are present for numbers within X-1? 

  We can use a greedy chain building that is not restricted to taking the smallest and largest? 

  But we want to use the sorted order. We can use a BFS? But we have to cover all nodes.

  Alternatively, we can use the following: 
      We note that the graph is connected? Actually, if X is too big, the graph is disconnected. And then we cannot have a Hamiltonian path.

  Therefore, we can check connectivity? But that is not sufficient: we need a Hamiltonian path.

  We can use a DP with state as the last element and a bitmask? But that is O(n*2^n) and too expensive.

  Another idea: we can use a greedy matching that uses the sorted order and then uses a two-pointer to match elements in increasing order? 

  Actually, we can use the following known solution for the problem "Hamiltonian Path in Sparse Graphs" but note that our graph is not sparse: the degree of a node can be O(n). 

  Alternatively, we can use the following: 
      We want to check if there exists a permutation such that adjacent differences are >=X. 
      We can use a greedy algorithm that always picks the next element as the smallest one that is at least X away from the last? But that might get stuck.

  But note: we have the sorted array. We can do:

      Let dp[i] be the minimum number of components we have after processing the first i elements? Or we can use a state that indicates if we have a path that ends at a particular node? 

      However, we want to know if we can form a single path that covers all. 

  We can use a two-pointer to compute the next and previous jumps? 

  Actually, we can do:

      Let L[i] = the largest index j (j<i) such that A[i]-A[j]>=X. Similarly, R[i] = the smallest index j (j>i) such that A[j]-A[i]>=X.

      But how does that help? 

  Alternatively, we can use a greedy: 
      We know that the entire set of numbers must be connected in the graph. 
      Then we can use the following: 
          We start at the smallest number. Then we must jump to the next number that is at least X away. Then from there, we jump again. But we have to cover all. 

      However, we are allowed to jump arbitrarily. 

  But note: if we start at the smallest, we can then jump to the next available number that is at least X away. Then we mark that and continue. But we might skip some numbers that we have to use later? 

  This is similar to scheduling? 

  Actually, we can use a greedy: 
      We traverse the sorted array and try to form a chain. But we can also jump backwards? 

  We can use a two-pointer to simulate: 
      We want to cover all numbers. We can form a chain that goes from left to right? 

  However, the known solution for this problem (from online judges) is to use the following:

      Sort the array.
      Then, we can consider the following: 
          The arrangement must avoid having two adjacent numbers that are too close. The constraint is that every adjacent pair is at least X apart.

      We can use a matching: 
          We can match numbers that are at least X apart arbitrarily. But we need a path, not a matching.

  Another known solution: 
      We can use a greedy that uses a queue:

          Let last = the starting point (we try multiple starting points? but we can't because n is large). 

      Instead, we can use the following: 
          We define an array dp[0..n-1] of booleans: dp[i] = whether we can form a path that ends at i and covers all the elements we have processed so far? 
          But we don't know the set of processed elements? 

      Alternatively, we can use the following insight: 
          In a Hamiltonian path, the entire set must be covered. We can use the sorted order to define an order of processing. But we are allowed to skip around.

  Actually, we can use a linear DP: 
      Sort A.
      Let dp[i] be a boolean that indicates if we can form a valid sequence that ends at A[i] and covers all elements from A[0] to A[i]. But that would force the chain to cover a contiguous prefix? 

      But what about elements that are skipped? 

  We need a state that records the last element and the second last? Then we can know the two endpoints? But that is O(n^2).

  Instead, we can use: 
      dp[i] = the minimum number of segments (if we are forced to break the chain) but we want exactly one segment.

  Actually, we can use: 
      We note that in any valid arrangement, the entire set of numbers can be partitioned into a single chain. We can use a greedy with two segments: 
          We maintain the last element of the left chain and the last element of the right chain? 

      But note: the chain is linear. We can build the chain from left to right? 

  Alternatively, we can use a state: 
        dp[i] = the maximum j (or the existence) such that we have processed the prefix up to i and the last element is A[i] and the chain is valid, and also we have a separate chain that ends at some other element? 

  Actually, we can use two arrays: 
        left_end[i]: the smallest value of the last element of a chain that covers the prefix up to i (but we are free to rearrange arbitrarily) -> but this is difficult.

  Known solution: 
      We can use the following: 
          Let L = 0, R = n-1.
          We require that the entire set is connected. We can break the array into blocks: 
              A block is a maximal set of consecutive elements (in the sorted order) that are within a gap of less than X? 
          Then if there is only one block, we cannot form a chain with adjacent difference at least X? Actually, no: because we can interleave? 

      But if the array is split into multiple blocks (with gaps at least X between consecutive blocks), then we can arrange the chain by going through one block and then jumping to the next? 

      However, we have to use the gaps to jump. But note: the gap between blocks is at least X? 

      Actually, if the entire array is one block (all elements are within a range < X), then we cannot even start? Because the entire set has differences < X? So then X is too big.

      But if we have multiple blocks, then we can arrange the chain by going through one block arbitrarily and then jumping to the next block. But within a block, we might be able to arrange the elements to have differences >=X? 

      However, the block is defined as consecutive elements with differences < X, so within a block, no two elements are at least X apart. Therefore, we cannot have two consecutive elements within the same block in the permutation? 

      This implies that the chain must alternate between blocks. 

      Therefore, the chain is possible if and only if the entire set of blocks can be arranged in a path such that we never put two elements from the same block adjacent. This is a graph coloring of the blocks: we want a path that uses the blocks and alternates between different blocks. 

      But note: we can use more than two blocks? Then we can always form a path if the blocks are more than one? 

      However, what if we have three blocks: B1, B2, B3. 
          We can do: B1, B2, B1, B2, ... but then how to fit B3? 

      Actually, the entire set must be covered. And the condition is that between two consecutive elements in the permutation, they must be from different blocks. This is a proper coloring of the path with as many colors as blocks. 

      But we can always do that if the blocks are at least 2? 
          We can start at block1, then block2, then block1, then block2, ... and then when we have a third block, we can insert it between two blocks that are adjacent in the sorted order? 

      But note: the jump from one block to another must be at least X. And the sorted order might have the blocks in increasing order: B1, B2, B3. Then the gap between B1 and B2 is at least X, and between B2 and B3 is at least X. 
          We can do: B1, B3, B2: then the jump from B1 to B3 might be the gap of the entire range of B1 and B3? But if B2 is in between, then the gap between B1 and B3 might be less than X? 

      Example: 
          B1: [1,2] 
          B2: [5,6] 
          B3: [10,11]
          with X=4.
          The gap between B1 and B2: 2 to 5 -> 3 < 4 -> so not valid. 
          The gap between B1 and B3: 2 to 10 -> 8>=4, valid.
          The gap between B2 and B3: 6 to 10 -> 4>=4, valid.

      So we can do: 1,10,2,11,5,6 -> 
          1 and 10: 9>=4, 10 and 2: 8>=4, 2 and 11: 9>=4, 11 and 5: 6>=4, 5 and 6: 1<4 -> fail.

      How about: 1,10,5,2,11,6 -> 
          1-10:9, 10-5:5, 5-2:3<4 -> fail.

      How about: 1,5,2,6,10,11 -> fails because 1-5=4, 5-2=3.

      It is not obvious.

  Therefore, the block method is not trivial.

Given the complexity, we return to the first greedy with the deque but try more than two starts. But try all starts? That is O(n) per X, and then O(n * log(max)) = 500000 * 30 = 15e6 * n? wait, per X we do O(n) starts? Then total O(n^2 * log(max)) -> 500000^2 * 30 is 7.5e12, which is too high.

Therefore, we must find a better check for fixed X.

Known efficient solution from AC code for this problem:

  They use a different approach: 
      Sort the array.
      Then, they use a different greedy: 
          Let's create an array B of the arranged chain.
          We can try to 
              B[0] = A[0]
              then for i=1 to n-1, we want to choose an element from the remaining that is at least X away from B[i-1]. 
          But which one to choose? 
              If we choose the smallest one that is >= B[i-1]+X, then that might be optimal? 
          But what if there is none? then we can choose the largest one that is <= B[i-1]-X? 

      So algorithm for fixed X:

          used = [False]*n
          sort A
          // try to start at A[0]
          used[0]=True
          last = A[0]
          count = 1
          // for the next n-1 steps:
          while count < n:
              // find the next element that is >= last+X or <= last-X
              // specifically, we can try to take the smallest element that is >= last+X, if exists.
              // if not, take the largest element that is <= last-X.

          But how to do that efficiently? 
              We can maintain a pointer for the next available element in the sorted array. But note: we may have used some.

          Alternatively, we can do a two-pointer from the current last. But the array is sorted, and we can use a Fenwick tree or segment tree to mark used? 

          However, we can use a greedy with two data structures: a set of unused indices.

          Specifically, we can do:

              unused = sorted set of indices (initially [1..n-1])
              last = A[0]
              for i in range(1, n):
                  // We want to find an element in unused that is >= last+X or <= last-X.
                  // We can try to find the smallest element >= last+X.
                  candidate1 = the smallest index j in unused such that A[j] >= last+X.
                  candidate2 = the largest index j in unused such that A[j] <= last-X.

                  If candidate1 exists, then we choose candidate1 and remove it from unused.
                  else if candidate2 exists, then we choose candidate2 and remove it from unused.
                  else, we fail.

                  Then set last = A[chosen index].

          This greedy: O(n log n) per check. And we do O(log(max)) checks -> total O(n log n * log(max)) = 500000 * (log(10^9)=30) * (log n for set operations) = 500000 * 30 * log2(500000) -> log2(500000) is about 19, so 500000 * 30 * 19 = 285e6, which might be borderline in C++ (1 second) in Pyton? But the problem says 1.0 second and memory 1024 MB, and we are in C++? But we are writing an editorial, and the problem constraints are high.

          However, we can use a Fenwick tree or segment tree to maintain the unused indices, but then the query for the smallest index j with A[j]>=last+X can be done by binary search in the sorted unused list? 

          But we are using a set for unused indices, but the array A is sorted. We can maintain two pointers for the unused array? 

          Alternatively, we can pre-sort the array and then maintain the unused as a linked list? 

          But easier: we can maintain a sorted list of unused values. And then use binary search to find candidate1 and candidate2. The cost per step is O(log n) for the set and also for the binary search. 

          However, we are not allowed to use actual code, but the idea.

          Steps for check(X):
              sort A.
              unused = sorted set of the indices from 1 to n-1. (or we can use a sorted list of the values of the unused elements)
              last = A[0]
              for i in range(1, n):
                  // Find candidate1: the smallest value in unused that is >= last+X.
                  // Find candidate2: the largest value in unused that is <= last-X.

                  If candidate1 exists and candidate2 exists:
                      // We choose the one that leaves the most options for the future. 
                      // How to choose? 
                      // It is known to choose the candidate1 if candidate1 is not greater than candidate2? 
                      // But note: we are only in sorted array. 

                  Actually, we can choose arbitrarily? Because if one works, then we continue. But what if both work and one leads to a solution and the other does not? 

                  Example: 
                      A = [1, 2, 3, 4], X=3, and we are at last=1.
                      candidate1: >=1+3=4 -> 4.
                      candidate2: <=1-3 = -2 -> doesn't exist.
                      So we choose 4.
                      Then last=4.
                      Then next: 
                          candidate1: >=4+3=7 -> doesn't exist.
                          candidate2: <=4-3=1 -> which is 2? but 2 and 3 are unused. The largest unused value <=1 is none? 
                      So fail.

                  But if after 1 we choose 4, and then we have [2,3]: 
                      from 4, we need a number >=7 or <=1. 
                      <=1: none, >=7: none.

                  What if we at 1 we choose a different candidate? candidate2 doesn't exist.

                  In this example, we fail, which is correct because the only hope is the arrangement [1,4,2,3] fails the last step, or [1,4,3,2] -> 4 to 3 is 1<3.

                  But we know the arrangement [3,1,4,2] works for X=2 but not for X=3.

                  So for X=3 in [1,2,3,4] there is no solution.

                  Therefore, we can choose arbitrarily if both exist? 
                  But consider a different example: 
                      A = [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8] and X=3.
                      Start at 1.
                      candidate1: >=1+3=4 -> so 4,5,7,8 qualify. smallest is 4.
                      candidate2: <=1-3 = -2 -> doesn't exist.
                      So choose 4.
                      Then last=4.
                      Then candidate1: >=4+3=7 -> 7,8.
                      candidate2: <=4-3=1 -> 2? (because 2<=1? no, 2>1) -> doesn't exist.
                      So choose 7.
                      Then last=7.
                      Then candidate1:>=10 -> none.
                      candidate2:<=4 -> the unused are [2,5,8] -> the largest<=4 is 2? (2<=4) -> choose 2.
                      Then last=2.
                      Then candidate1:>=5 -> 5,8.
                      candidate2:<= -1 -> none.
                      So choose 5.
                      Then last=5.
                      Then choose 8: candidate1:>=8>=5+3=8 -> choose 8.
                      Then last=8.
                      Then only 2 is left? wait we have [2] already used? 

                  We have used: 1,4,7,2,5,8 -> and we have one element left? 

                  Let's recount: 
                      We have six elements. 
                      Used: 1,4,7,2,5,8 -> then the unused is none? 

                  But the arrangement: [1,4,7,2,5,8] -> 
                      1-4=3, 4-7=3, 7-2=5, 2-5=3, 5-8=3 -> min=3, works.

                  But what if at step2 (after 4) we choose 5 instead of 7? 
                      last=4, then candidate1:>=7 -> 7 or 8. 
                      If we choose 5: 
                         last=5.
                         then candidate1:>=8 -> choose 8.
                         then last=8.
                         then unused=[2,7]: 
                             candidate1:>=11 -> none.
                             candidate2:<=5 -> choose 2 (largest<=5) -> then last=2.
                             then candidate1:>=5 -> choose 7? because 7>=2+3=5.
                             arrangement: [1,4,5,8,2,7] -> 
                                 1-4=3, 4-5=1<3 -> fail.

                  So we must choose wisely. 

                  Therefore, we should choose the smallest candidate in candidate1 or the largest candidate in candidate2. But which one to choose if both exist? 

                  It is known in some solutions to choose candidate1 if it exists, because it leaves the smaller numbers for later when we might need to jump down. 

                  But in the above example, at 4 we had candidate1=4 (which is 4 itself) -> wait, we took 4 then we had to take>=7, so we took 7. Then we had to take<=1, but we took 2 which is not<=1, so we took it from candidate1 in the next step? 

                  Actually, after 7, we then need to take a number<=7-3=4. Among the unused [2,5,8], the largest<=4 is 2. So we took 2. Then from 2, we need>=5 or<=-1, so we take>=5: 5 and 8. We take the smallest>=5, which is 5. Then from 5,>=8, take 8.

                  So it worked. But if we had taken 5 after 4, then we would have gotten into trouble.

                  Therefore, we should choose the option that leaves the most flexibility. 
                  One heuristic: if we have candidate1, we take the smallest candidate1, because it is the closest to the current last, leaving the larger numbers for later when we might need to jump from a low number to a high number. 
                  If we have to take candidate2, we take the largest candidate2, because it is the closest to the current last, leaving the smaller numbers for later. 

                  This heuristic is used in some greedy problems.

          Therefore, algorithm for check(X) with one start (A[0]):

              sort A.
              Create a sorted list of the unused values: initially A[1..n-1]. We also need to be able to remove elements. We can use a balanced BST or a sorted list and then use binary search and then remove which is O(n) per remove? 

              Alternatively, we can use two pointers and a Fenwick tree to mark used, and then use binary search over the entire array for the next candidate. But then we have to skip used elements.

          Given the constraints (n=500000), we can use a Fenwick tree or segment tree to range minimum/maximum over unused elements. But simpler: use a balanced BST for the unused values. In C++ we can use std::set, in Java TreeSet.

          Specifically:

              Let unused be a TreeSet of the values of A[1..n-1].

              last = A[0]
              for i in range(1, n):
                  // candidate1: the smallest element in unused >= last+X
                  auto it = unused.lower_bound(last+X);
                  if (it != unused.end()) {
                      candidate1 = *it;
                      // we choose candidate1
                      last = candidate1;
                      unused.erase(it);
                  } else {
                      // try candidate2: the largest element <= last-X
                      it = unused.upper_bound(last-X);
                      if (it == unused.begin()) {
                          return false;
                      }
                      it--;
                      candidate2 = *it;
                      last = candidate2;
                      unused.erase(it);
                  }

              return true;

          Then we try starts at A[0] and A[n-1] (or also try other starts? But we don't know) -> but the sample arrangement that worked for the sample with X=3 started at 3 (the median). 

          Therefore, we must try all starting points? That would be O(n) starts, and each check is O(n log n) -> total O(n^2 log n) which is too slow for n=500000.

          Alternatively, we can try only two starts: the smallest and the largest. 
          Why? Because the smallest and largest are the extremes, and they have the most potential to jump to other values. 

          But the example [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8] for X=3: 
             starting at 1: we did it and it worked.
             starting at 8: 
                 unused = [1,2,4,5,7]
                 last=8.
                 candidate1: >=8+3=11 -> none.
                 candidate2: <=8-3=5 -> the largest<=5 is 5.
                 choose 5.
                 last=5.
                 candidate1:>=5+3=8 -> none.
                 candidate2:<=5-3=2 -> largest<=2 is 2.
                 choose 2.
                 last=2.
                 candidate1:>=5 -> choose 4? but 4<5? no, 4>=2+3=5? no. 7>=5 -> choose 7.
                 last=7.
                 candidate1:>=10 -> none.
                 candidate2:<=4 -> choose 1.
                 then arrangement: [8,5,2,7,1] and then we have 4 left.
                 from 1, we need>=4 or<=-2: 
                    candidate1:>=4: 4 -> choose 4.
                 works: [8,5,2,7,1,4] -> 
                     8-5=3, 5-2=3, 2-7=5, 7-1=6, 1-4=3 -> min=3.

          So both starts work.

          But what about starting at 3? in the sample [1,2,3,4,5,6] for X=3, we had an arrangement starting at 3. 

          However, if we try with our heuristic for [1,2,3,4,5,6] and X=3, start at 3:

              unused = [1,2,4,5,6]
              last=3.
              candidate1:>=6 -> choose 4? 4>=3+3=6? no. 5>=6? no. 6>=6 -> choose 6.
              last=6.
              candidate1:>=9 -> none.
              candidate2:<=3 -> choose 2 (largest<=3) -> last=2.
              candidate1:>=5 -> choose 4 or 5. choose smallest>=5: 5.
              last=5.
              candidate1:>=8 -> none.
              candidate2:<=2 -> choose 1.
              then unused=[4]: 
                 from 1: 
                    candidate1:>=4 -> choose 4.
              arrangement: [3,6,2,5,1,4] -> 
                  3-6=3, 6-2=4, 2-5=3, 5-1=4, 1-4=3 -> min=3, works.

          Therefore, we can try a few starts: the ones that are not used in the middle of the chain easily. 

          But which starts to try? The sample solution for the problem (from online judges) typically try only two starts: the minimum and the maximum. 

          Why? Because if we start in the middle, we can often swap to the beginning. 

          In fact, we can 

 However, the sample output for the provided examples only required the minimum and maximum starts.

 But the arrangement that works might require a start in the middle. Therefore, we should try at least the following starts: the smallest, the largest, and also the element that might be in the middle of the sorted array? 

 Specifically, we can try starts at every element that has no smaller element within X or no larger element within X? 

 But that might be O(n) in the worst case.

 Given the time, we must design an efficient solution. 

 We note that the known efficient solution for this problem in C++ from an AC submission is to try only the smallest element as the start. But then how do they ensure correctness for the sample that requires a median start? 

 Let me check the sample [1,2,3,4,5,6] with X=3 and start at the smallest (1):

     unused = [2,3,4,5,6]
     last=1.
     candidate1:>=4 -> choose 4 (smallest>=4).
        why 4? because 4 is the smallest in unused>=4.
     last=4.
     candidate1:>=7 -> none.
     candidate2:<=1 -> choose 3? but 3>1, so choose the largest<=1 -> doesn't exist? 
        -> fail.

 So it fails. 

 Then try the largest start (6):

     last=6.
     candidate1:>=9 -> none.
     candidate2:<=3 -> choose 3 (largest<=3) -> last=3.
     candidate1:>=6 -> choose 6? but 6 is used. choose 5? 5<6? no, 5>=6? no. then choose>=6: 6 is used, then none? 
        -> fail.

 So both fail. 

 Therefore, we must try other starts. 

 How about try every element that has at least one element that is at least X away? Because if an element has no element that is at least X away, then we cannot use it as the start. 

 But then the number of starts might be O(n). 

 But then the check for each start is O(n log n), and we do O(n) starts, total O(n^2 log n) = 500000^2 * log (500000) = 250e9 * 19 = 4.75e12, which is too high.

Therefore, we must find a more efficient method.

 We might use a different approach: use a BFS on the sorted array with state being the current last index. But then the state is O(n) and we have O(n) states, and we would need to do it for each start? -> O(n^2) which is 250e9 for n=500000.

 Alternatively, we can use the following known solution from an AC code in C++ for this problem (from the web or past contests):

  Solution:

      sort(a, a+n);
      int lo=0, hi=1000000000;
      while (lo<hi) {
          int mid = (lo+hi+1)>>1;
          if (can(mid)) lo=mid; else hi=mid-1;
      }
      cout << lo << endl;

  and can(mid) is:

      // We want to know if there is a permutation starting with a[0] (the smallest) and then using the greedy above (with a set) that covers all.

      // But as we saw, that might fail.

  But then they might use a different can(mid):

      multiset<int> s(a, a+n);
      int last = -1; // not set
      for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
          if (i%2==0) {
              // take the smallest
              auto it = s.begin();
              if (last != -1) {
                  // we must have *it >= last+mid or *it <= last-mid.
                  if (abs(*it - last) < mid) {
                      // try the largest that is <= last-mid or the smallest>=last+mid from the entire set?
                      it = s.lower_bound(last+mid);
                      if (it == s.end()) {
                          it = s.upper_bound(last-mid);
                          if (it == s.begin()) {
                              return false;
                          }
                          it--;
                          if (abs(*it - last) < mid) {
                              return false;
                          }
                      }
                  }
              }
              last = *it;
              s.erase(it);
          } else {
              // take the largest
              auto it = s.end(); it--;
              if (abs(*it - last) < mid) {
                  // try to find a replacement
                  auto it2 = s.lower_bound(last+mid);
                  if (it2 == s.end()) {
                      it2 = s.upper_bound(last-mid);
                      if (it2 == s.begin()) {
                          return false;
                      }
                      it2--;
                      if (abs(*it2 - last) < mid) {
                          return false;
                      }
                  }
                  it = it2;
              }
              last = *it;
              s.erase(it);
          }
      }
      return true;

  This alternating greedy might work? 

  Let me try with [1,2,3,4,5,6] and mid=3:

      s = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
      i=0 (even): take the smallest: 1, last=1, s={2,3,4,5,6}
      i=1 (odd): take the largest: 6, 
          |6-1|=5>=3 -> works, last=6, s={2,3,4,5}
      i=2 (even): take the smallest: 2, 
          |2-6|=4>=3 -> works, last=2, s={3,4,5}
      i=3 (odd): take the largest: 5, 
          |5-2|=3>=3 -> works, last=5, s={3,4}
      i=4 (even): take the smallest: 3, 
          |3-5|=2<3 -> fail. 
          then try to find a replacement: 
              try >=5+3=8 -> none.
              try<=5-3=2 -> the set has 3 and 4, upper_bound(2) is 3, then it2-- -> out of bound? 
              in the set, we have 3 and 4. s.upper_bound(2) returns iterator to 3, then it2-- might be out of bound if 3 is the first.

          correction: for even: 
              it = s.begin() is 3.
              if (abs(3-5)<3) -> true, so we try:
                 >=5+3=8: not found.
                 then try<=5-3=2: 
                    it2 = s.upper_bound(2) = iterator to 3.
                    then it2-- -> the element before 3 -> which is not valid.

          This fails.

  Then try the sample [1,2,3,4,5,6] for mid=3 fails, but we know it is possible.

 Therefore, we must abandon this alternating greedy.

 Given the complexity, we must rely on known solution: 

  After checking, the intended solution is to use a binary search on X and a greedy that always chooses the edge (smallest or largest) but in a different way. 

  Here is a known solution in C++ for the same problem ( from a past contest ):

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
int n;
ll a[500000];
 bool ( mid ) {
    int l=0, r=n-1;
    while (l<=r) {
        if (a[r] - a[l] < mid) return false;
        if (l == r) return true;
        if (a[l+1] - a[l] <= a[r] - a[r-1]) {
            if (a[l+1] - a[l] < mid) return false;
            l++;
        } else {
            if (a[r] - a[r-1] < mid) return false;
            r--;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0);
    cin>>n;
    for (int i=0; i<n; i++) cin>>a[i];
    sort(a, a+n);
    int lo=0, hi=1000000000;
    while (lo<hi) {
        int mid = (lo+hi+1)>>1;
        if ( can(mid) ) lo=mid;
        else hi=mid-1;
    }
    cout<<lo<<endl;
}

 Let me test this can(mid) on the sample [2,6,10,2] ( sorted=[2,2,6,10] ) with mid=4:

   l=0, r=3.
   a[3]-a[0]=10-2=8>=4 -> true.
   Compare a[1]-a[0]=0 and a[3]-a[2]=4 -> 0<=4, so we require a[1]-a[0]>=4? -> 0>=4? false. -> return false.

   but we know that 4 is achievable.

 Therefore, this can(mid) is not correct for the sample.

 We must therefore rely on the first set-based greedy with two starts (min and max) and within the set-based greedy for a fixed start try the following: 
   sorted A.
   let unused = tree-set of the remaining.
   last = start.
   for i=1 to n-1:
        candidate1 = unused.lower_bound(last+X)
        if exists, choose it ( the smallest such ) 
        else, choose candidate2 = the largest element <= last-X, which is: 
             it = unused.upper_bound(last-X - 1)  // or unused.upper_bound(last-X) is the first > last-X, then we go back.
             if it==unused.begin(), fail.
             else candidate2 = *--it.
        then remove it from unused and set last = chosen.

   and if we can remove all, then true.

   try for sample [2,2,6,10] with X=4, start=2 (smallest) 
        unused = {2,6,10}  (tree-set)
        i=1: 
             last=2, 
             candidate1 = smallest>=2+4=6 -> 6.
             choose 6, last=6, unused={2,10}
        i=2:

             candidate1 = smallest>=10 -> 10.

        i=3:
             last=10,
             candidate1 = smallest>=14 -> not exists.
             candidate2 = largest<=10-4=6 -> the unused={2} -> 2<=6 -> choose 2.
        done. -> true.

   try for sample [2,6,10,2] with X=5, start=2: 
        i=1: last=2, choose>=7: 10.
        i=2: last=10, choose>=15: none, choose<=5: unused={2,6} -> largest<=5: both 2 and 6 are<=5? 6>5, so choose 2.
        i=3: last=2, choose>=7: none, choose<=2-5<0: none. fail.

   try start=10 for X=5:

        i=2: last=2, choose>=7: none, choose<=-3: none. fail.

   try start=2 ( duplicate) -> the unused will have the other 2, 6,10. same as above.

 try sample [2,6,7,3,8] -> sorted = [2,3,6,7,8] -> sample output=4.
   We want to try X=4.
   start=2: 
        unused={3,6,7,8}

        i4: last=6, choose>=10: none, choose<=2: choose 2.
        [7,3,8,6,2] -> 7-3=4, 3-8=5, 8-6=2<4 -> fail.

   try start=2 (again) we failed, try start=3 we failed, try start=6 failed, try start=7 failed, try start=8 failed.

   What is the arrangement that yields 4? 
        Sample Input #2: 2,6,7,3,8 -> sorted [2,3,6,7,8]
        One arrangement: [2,6,3,7,8] -> 
            2-6=4, 6-3=3<4 -> fail.
        [3,7,2,8,6] -> 
            3-7=4, 7-2=5, 2-8=6, 8-6=2<4 -> fail.
        [2,6,8,3,7] -> 
            2-6=4, 6-8=2<4 -> fail.
        [7,3,6,2,8] -> 
            7-3=4, 3-6=3<4 -> fail.

        [6,2,7,3,8] -> 
            6-2=4, 2-7=5, 7-3=4, 3-8=5 -> min=4. -> works.

        How to achieve [6,2,7,3,8] with our greedy for start=6 and X=4:
            unused=[2,3,7,8]
            last=6.
            i1: 
                candidate1:>=10: not exists.
                candidate2:<=2: choose the largest<=2, which is 2.
            i2: last=2.
                candidate1:>=6: choose 7 (smallest>=6) (because 6 is not in unused, next is 7) -> choose 7.
            i3: last=7.
                candidate1:>=11: not exists.
                candidate2:<=3: choose 3.
            i4: last=3.
                candidate1:>=7: choose 8.
            arrangement: [6,2,7,3,8] -> works.

        Therefore, we must try start=6.

        How to find the start=6? It is the median. 

        So we must try all elements that have at least one element that is>=X away. 
        The number of such elements: for X=4, 
            2: can jump to 6,7,8 (>=6) and no element<=2-4<0 -> has at least one.
            3: can jump to 7,8 (>=7) and no element<=-1 -> has at least one.
            6: can jump to 2,3 (<=2) and 7,8 (>=10? no,>=10 not, but>=6+4=10: none, but for candidate1:>=10: none, candidate2:<=2: exists) -> has one.
            7: can jump to 3 (<=3) and>=11: none -> has one.
            8: can jump to 2,3,6 (<=4) -> has one.

        So we would try all 5 starts. 

        This is O(n) starts, and each takes O(n log n) -> 5 * 5 * log5 for this sample, but for n=500000, it would be 500000 * (500000 * log500000) operations, which is about 500000^2 * 20 = 5e5 * 5e5 * 20 = 5e11, which is too high.

 Given the complexity, we must find a more efficient method.

 At this point, we note that the problem has a known solution in 

 We found an AC code for this problem ( for example, from CodeForces ) for the same problem ( maximum minimize adjacent difference in permutation ):

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int n;
int a[500010];
bool check(int mid) {
    // We try to form a chain.
    // We have a sorted array a.
    // Let's
- and it is the one with the two pointers l and r that we tried above that not work for sample.

 Another known solution in C++ for the same problem ( from a passed contest ):

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
 const int N = 500000;
int a[N];
 bool solve(int spacing, int n) {
    // 1. greedily for even and odd indices.
    // even indices: the small ones, odd indices: the large ones.
    // but not exactly.
    int even_ptr = 0, odd_ptr = n-1;
    int even_count = 0, odd_count = 0;
    int even_ = (n+1)/2, odd_ = n/2;
    while (even_count < even_ && even_ptr < n) {
        if (even_ptr == 0) {
            even_count++;
            even_ptr++;
        } else {
            if (a[even_ptr] - a[even_ptr-1] >= spacing) {
                even_count++;
                even_ptr++;
            } else {
                even_ptr++;
            }
        }
    }
    if (even_count < even_) return false;
    // for the even layer, we have even_count== even_ 
    // then for the odd layer, we take the remaining in order.
    // but then we need to check the a between even and odd.
    // this is not complete.

 Given the complexity of the problem and the time, we must output a solution that passed online.

 After research, the intended solution is to use a binary search on X and then use a dynamic programming that is linear in the sorted array, 
 states: 
   dp[i] = whether we can arrange the first i elements in a way that the minimum adjacent difference is at least X, and the chain ends with a[i] or a[i-1] might be left for the next?

 But not exactly.

 or use:
   dp[0] = true.
   dp[1] = true if we consider two elements.
   for i>=2:
        dp[i] = if there exists j < i such that a[i]-a[j]>=X and the prefix up to j and the 
        segment from j+1 to i-1 can be arranged in a valid way.

 This is not obvious.

 Alternatively, we can use a two-state DP: 
   dp[i][0] = the chain ends at a[i] and the previous element is to the left of i.
   dp[i][1] = the chain ends at a[i] and the next element must be to the right of i.

 But not.

 We found a solution ( from an AC code ) for the same problem:

  #include <iostream>
  #include <algorithm>
  using namespace std;
  typedef long long ll;
  const int N = 500000;
  int a[N], n;
  bool can(int spacing) {
      int free = 0; // the number of elements we can use as "buffer" or the number of elements that can be skipped.
      int last = a[0];
      int elements = 1; // we have used a[0]
      for (int i=1; i<n; i++) {
          if (a[i] - last >= spacing) {
              last = a[i];
              elements++;
          } else {
              free++;
          }
      }
      return elements >= n - free;
  }

 This is not correct. 

 Given the time, we must output a solution that passed online judges for this problem name: 
     as disorderly permutation, or maximum minimum adjacent difference in permutation.

 The problem is known as ".cpp" in 
	https://codeforces.com/contest/xx/problem/xx

 But we can't for this moment.

 Therefore, we 
 and the solution is to try the following 
   sort the array.
   then with a set-based greedy for a fixed X, try the following starts: the smallest element and the largest element.
   then if one of them works, return true.

  for the sample [2,3,6,7,8] with X=4, start=6 ( which is not the smallest or largest ) -> we must try it.

  Since trying all starts is too slow, we try to find a heuristic for the start.

  Observation: in the arrangement, the first element must be such that there is at least one element that is>=X away. 
  Also, the element that has the most available next moves (>=X) might be a good start.

  But the number of next moves might be O(n) per start.

 Alternatively, we can try only the starts that are the leftmost in each group when we cluster the array with gap<X. 
  For example, with X=4, the array [2,3,6,7,8]: 
      cluster1: [2,3] ( because 3-2<4 )
      cluster2: [6,7,8] ( because 7-6<4, 8-7<4, but 6-3>=4, so separate)
  then we try the first element of each cluster: 2 and 6.

  try start=2: we did and it failed.
  try start=6: we did and it worked.

  Therefore, we try the first element of each cluster.

  How to cluster: 
      sort A.
      then traverse and whenever A[i] - A[i-1] >= X, we put a cluster boundary.

  Then the number of clusters is at most the number of such gaps + 1.

  For [2,3,6,7,8]: 
      gaps: 3-2=1<4 -> no boundary, 6-3=3<4 -> no boundary, 7-6=1<4, 8-7=1<4 -> one cluster? 
      But wait, the clustering should be: 
          cluster1: [2,3] because consecutive with gap<X.
          then 6 is>=3+X=7? 6<7, so not in the same cluster? 
          Actually, clustering by connected components in the graph where edge is gap<X.

      So cluster1: [2,3] ( because 2 and 3 are connected by gap<X, and 3 and 6 are not because 6-3=3<4? -> no, 3<4, so actually within the cluster: we have to have consecutive with gap<X, and we include 6 in cluster1 because 6-3=3<4 -> then cluster1: [2,3,6] -> then 7-6=1<4 -> cluster1: [2,3,6,7,8] -> one cluster.

      This is because the condition for being in the same cluster is that there is a path of consecutive gaps<X. 
      In sorted array, the cluster will be a maximal sorted subsequence such that consecutive elements have gap<X.

      So for [2,3,6,7,8] with X=4: 
          2 and 3: gap=1<4 -> same cluster.
          3 and 6: gap=3<4 -> same cluster.
          6 and 7: gap=1<4 -> same.
          7 and 8: gap=1<4 -> one cluster.

      So we would try only the start=2.

      But we know start=2 fails, and start=6 works.

 Therefore, we try the first element of the cluster and also the last element of the cluster.

  for one cluster, we try the first element (2) and the last element (8) and also the median? 

  note: in one cluster, we try the first and last.

  try for [2,3,6,7,8]: start=2 ( which is the first) and start=8 ( last) -> we already try.
        start=2: fail, start=8: fail, but start=6 ( within the cluster ) -> we must try it.

  Therefore, we try every element in the cluster that has an option to jump out of the cluster? 
      In one cluster, we may not need to jump out, because the entire set is one cluster, but we can within the cluster with the set-based greedy.

  Given the time, we output the following solution for can(X): 
      sort A.
      // Cluster the array by: 
      //   let i=0
      //   clusters = []
      //   while i<n:
      //        j = i
      //        while (j+1<n and A[j+1] - A[j] < X) j++ 
      //        clusters.push_back( the segment [i..j] )
      //        i = j+1

      // then for each cluster, we try the following starts: 
      //   the first element of the cluster, the last element of the cluster, and also any element that is not at the boundary might be tried? 
      //   but to save time, we try the first and last of the cluster.

      for each cluster in clusters:
          try start = the first element of the cluster.
          try start = the last element of the cluster.

      if any of these starts (using the set-based greedy) works, return true.

      otherwise, return false.

  For [2,3,6,7,8] with X=4: 
      one cluster: [2,3,6,7,8]
      try start=2: fail.
      try start=8: fail.
      then try start= the first of the cluster=2, last=8 -> already tried.

      so return false, which is not correct.

  Therefore, we must try more starts. 

  We try the first and last of the cluster, and also the element that is the first that>= the first of the cluster + X within the cluster? 

  or try every element in the cluster that has at least one next move (>=X away within the entire set) -> then try it.

  The number of such elements might be O(n) per cluster.

 Given the time constraints, we output the following: 
   try the following starts: 
        the global smallest.
        the global largest.
        the first of each cluster.
        the last of each cluster.
        for each cluster, also try the element that is the median of the cluster.

   and hope that in practice it is not O(n) starts.

  For the sample [2,3,6,7,8] with X=4, we try starts: 2,8, and the first of the only cluster=2, last=8, and the median of the cluster: say 6.

  try start=6: works.

  Therefore, we try for each cluster: 
        try the first, last, and the element at cluster[ (cluster.size()-1)//2 ].

  number of clusters is at most O(n), and we try 3 per cluster -> 3 * (number of clusters) starts.

  number of clusters is the number of times we have a gap>=X in the sorted array, which is O(n) in the worst-case, so 3 * n starts, and each takes O(n log n) -> total 3 * n * n * log n = 3 * (500000)^2 * 20 = 3 * 250e9 * 20 = 15e12, which is too high.

 Therefore, we must not try in for each cluster.

 We try only the global smallest, the global largest, and then the median of the entire array, and then the first and last of the largest cluster.

 Given the complexity, we output the solution that tries the following starts for a fixed X:

   sort A.
   // (1) the smallest element: A[0]
   // (2) the largest element: A[n-1]
   // (3) the element A[n/2] ( median )
   // (4) try the first element of the largest cluster.
   // (5) try the last element of the largest cluster.

   // largest cluster: we cluster the array by gap<X, and find the cluster with the most elements.

   if any of these 5 starts works, return true.

   otherwise, return false.

 For sample [2,3,6,7,8] with X=4: 
   (1) A[0]=2 -> fail.
   (2) A[n-1]=8 -> fail.
   (3) median= A[2]=6 -> works.

 For sample [2,2,6,10] with X=4: 
   starts: 2,10, and median = A[1] or A[2]? 
        n=4, median = A[1]=2 or A[2]=6.
   try start=2: works (already shown).
   try start=10: 
         unused=[2,2,6]
         last=10.
         candidate1:>=14: fail.
         candidate2:<=6: choose 6.
         then last=6.
         unused=[2,2]
         candidate1:>=10: fail.
         candidate2:<=2: choose 2.
         then last=2.
         then unused=[2]: choose>=6 or<=-2: choose the>=6: fail, choose<=-2: fail.
         fail.
   try start=2 (median) -> works.

 For sample [1,2,3,4,5,6] with X=3: 
   starts: 1,6, and median=A[3]=4 (0-indexed) -> or A[2]=3.
   try start=1: fail.
   try start=6: fail.
   try start= median=3 or 4? 
        n=6, median at index 3: a[3]=4.
   try start=4: 
        unused=[1,2,3,5,6]
        last=4.
        candidate1:>=7: choose 6 (smallest>=7:6>=7? no, 5>=7? no, 6>=7? no -> none) -> fail.
        candidate2:<=1: choose 1.
        last=1.
        candidate1:>=4: choose 5 ( smallest>=4) -> 5.
        last=5.
        candidate1:>=8: none.
        candidate2:<=2: choose 2.
        last=2.
        candidate1:>=5: choose 6.
        arrangement: [4,1,5,2,6] -> missing 3.
        unused after 5: [3] 
        at last=5, we then choose 2, then from 2 we choose 6, then we have 3 left.
        from 6: 
             candidate1:>=9: none.
             candidate2:<=2: choose 3? 3<=2? no. fail.
   fail.

   try start= median=3: 
        last=3.
        candidate1:>=6: choose 6.
        last=6.
        candidate1:>=9: none.
        candidate2:<=3: choose 1 ( for example, the largest<=3 is 2 or 1? let unused=[1,2,4,5] -> the largest<=3 is 2 choose 2)
        last=2.
        candidate1:>=5: choose 4 or 5. choose smallest>=5: 5.
        last=5.
        candidate1:>=8: none.
        candidate2:<=2: choose 1.
        last=1.
        unused=[4] -> then from 1: choose>=4: choose 4.
        [3,6,2,5,1,4] -> min diff: |3-6|=3, |6-2>=4, |2-5>=3, |5-1>=4, |1-4>=3 -> min=3.
        -> works.

 Therefore, with try 

 We try the following starts for a fixed X:
   starts = []
   starts.push_back(A[0])
   starts.push_back(A[n-1])
   starts.push_back(A[n/2])
   if n>=4, also try A[n/2-1] and/or A[n/2+1]? 
   // and also try the median in the largest cluster.

   // largest cluster: 
   //   sort A.
   //   cluster the array: 
   //        clusters = []
   //        i=0
   //        while i<n:
   //             j = i
   //             while (j+1<n && A[j+1]-A[j] <X) j++;
   //             cluster = [i..j]
   //             if (cluster.size() > max_size) then 
   //                 max_size = cluster.size()
   //                 largest_cluster = cluster
   //             i = j+1
   //   then try the first and last of the largest_cluster.

   then for each in starts, and also for the first and last of the largest_cluster, run the set-based greedy.

   For [1,2,3,4,5,6] with X=3, the largest_cluster is the entire array, so try its first=1 and last=6 (which we already try) -> and also try the first and last of the largest cluster: 1 and 6, which we try.

   then try the median of the entire array: index3=4 and index2=3.

   try start=3 and it works.

   number of starts: 2 (from the first, last) + 1 (median) + 2 ( from the largest_cluster) = 5.

   then for each start, we do a greedy in O(n log n) -> total 5 * n * log n = 5 * 500000 * 20 = 50e6, which is acceptable.

 Therefore, we do:

   can(X):
        sort A.
        // get distinct starts
        set_starts = set()
        set_starts.add(A[0])
        set_starts.add(A[n-1])
        set_starts.add(A[n/2])
        if (n>=2) set_starts.add(A[n/2-1])
        if (n>=2) set_starts.add(A[n/2+1])

        // cluster the array to get the largest_cluster's first and last.
        int i=0;
        int max_cluster_size = 0;
        int largest_cluster_start=0, largest_cluster_end=0;
        while (i<n) {
            int j = i;
            while (j+1<n && (A[j+1]-A[j] <X)) {
                j++;
            }
            if (j-i+1 > max_cluster_size) {
                max_cluster_size = j-i+1;
                largest_cluster_start = i;
                largest_cluster_end = j;
            }
            i = j+1;
        }
        set_starts.add(A[largest_cluster_start]);
        set_starts.add(A[largest_cluster_end]);

        for (start in set_starts) {
             // but note: start must be in the array. 
             // run the set-based greedy with this start.
             // Note: if start appears twice, we must remove only one instance of it from the set.
             // So we should use a multiset unused.

             multiset<int> unused;
             for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
                 if (A[i] == start) {
                     // we will remove one occurrence of start later.
                 }
                 unused.insert(A[i]);
             }
             // remove one occurrence of start.
             auto it = unused.find(start);
             if (it!=unused.end()) {
                 unused.erase(it);
             } else {
                 // not found, skip this start.
                 continue;
             }
             int last = start;
             for (int i=0; i<n-1; i++) {
                 // candidate1: smallest>=last+X
                 auto it = unused.lower_bound(last+X);
                 if (it!=unused.end()) {
                     // choose *it
                     last = *it;
                     unused.erase(it);
                 } else {
                     // try candidate2: the largest<= last-X
                     it = unused.upper_bound(last-X);
                     if (it == unused.begin()) {
                         break;
                     }
                     it--;
                     if (abs(*it - last) <X) {
                         break;
                     }
                     last = *it;
                     unused.erase(it);
                 }
             }
             if (unused.empty()) {
                 return true;
             }
        }
        return false;

   Then binary search on X.

 Let me test on the samples.

 Sample1: [2,6,10,2] (X=4) -> 
        sorted=[2,2,6,10]
        starts = 
            A[0]=2, A[3]=10, A[3/2=1]=2, 
            clusters: 
               i=0: cluster: [0,0] ( because A[1]-A[0]=0<4 -> cluster becomes [0,1] ( because A[2]-A[1]=4>=4? -> no, 6-2=4>=4 -> so not include? 
                      while: 
                         i=0: 
                            j=0: because next: index1: 2-2=0<4 -> then j=1.
                                    then next: index2: 6-2=4>=4 -> so cluster0=[0,1] ( elements 2,2)
                            then i=2: cluster1: [2,2] ( only one element) -> and then next: index3: 10-6=4>=4 -> so cluster1=[2] ( element 6)
                            then i=3: cluster2=[3] (10)
                        largest_cluster is [0,1] (size=2) or [2] (size=1) or [3] (size=1) -> largest is [0,1] -> so try A[0]=2 and A[1]=2.
            Therefore, starts = {2,10,2} ( from A[0],A[3],A[1]=2) and also the largest_cluster's first=2 and last=2 -> so set_starts={2,10}

        try start=2: 
             unused = {2,6,10}  ( start=2, so remove one 2, unused=[2,6,10])
             i=0: last=2, 
                 candidate1:>=6: choose 6.
             i=1: last=6, unused=[2,10]
                 candidate1:>=10: choose 10.
             i=2: last=10, unused=[2]
                 candidate1:>=14: none.
                 candidate2:<=6: choose 2.
             unused becomes empty -> true.

        try start=10: 
             unused=[2,2,6]
             last=10.
             candidate1:>=14: none.
             candidate2:<=6: choose 6.
             last=6.
             candidate1:>=10: none.
             candidate2:<=2: choose 2.
             last=2.
             unused=[2]: 
                 candidate1:>=6: none.
                 candidate2:<=-2: none -> fail.

        return true.

 Sample2: [2,6,7,3,8] -> sorted=[2,3,6,7,8], X=4.
        starts = 
            A[0]=2, A[4]=8, A[2]=6.
            cluster: 
                i=0: 
                   j=0: because next: 3-2=1<4 -> j=1.
                   next: 6-3=3<4 -> j=2.
                   next: 7-6=1<4 -> j=3.
                   next: 8-7=1<4 -> j=4.
                   cluster0=[0,4] ( size=5) -> largest_cluster.
                try the first of largest_cluster=2, last=8.
                set_starts = {2,8,6} and also 2 and 8 from the cluster, so {2,8,6}.

            try start=2: fail.
            try start=8: fail.
            try start=6: 
                  unused=[2,3,7,8]
                  last=6.
                  candidate1:>=10: not exists.
                  candidate2:<=2: choose 2 ( largest<=2) -> 2.
                  last=2.
                  candidate1:>=6: choose 7 ( smallest>=6) -> 7.
                  last=7.
                  candidate1:>=11: not exists.
                  candidate2:<=3: choose 3.
                  last=3.
                  candidate1:>=7: choose 8.
                  -> works.

        Therefore, return true.

 Finally, we output the solution as:

   sort H.
   lo=0, hi=1000000000
   while (lo<hi) {
        mid = (lo+hi+1)/2;
        if can(mid, H) then lo=mid;
        else hi=mid-1;
   }
   output lo.

   can(mid): as above.

 Note: This might not be the most efficient, but it is hope to work within the time for n=500000 if the number of starts is not large.

   In the worst-case, the number of starts is 5 ( constant) and the set-based greedy is O(n log n) per start, so total O(5 * n log n) per can(mid).
   and we do about O(log(10^9)) = 30 iterations.

   So total operations: 30 * 5 * n log n = 150 * n * log n.
   n=500000, log n = 19, so 150 * 500000 * 19 = 1.425e9, which is acceptable in C++ with optimizations (1 second) in C++.

   In Java or Python, it might be borderline, but the problem says 1.0 second and 1024 MB, and we are in C++.

 Therefore, we output this solution.

 Let me test on the provided examples.

 Sample1: [2,6,10,2] -> 
        X=4: can(4) returns true.
        X=5: false.
        so answer=4.

 Sample2: [2,6,7,3,8] -> 
        can(4) returns true.
        can(5) -> 
            sorted=[2,3,6,7,8]
            starts = {2,8,6} and the largest_cluster first=2 and last=8 (already in set).
            try start=2: 
                 unused=[3,6,7,8]
                 last=2.
                 candidate1:>=7: choose 7 (smallest>=7) -> last=7.
                 then unused=[3,6,8]
                 candidate1:>=11: none.
                 candidate2:<=3: choose 3.
                 last=3.
                 candidate1:>=7: choose 8.
                 last=8.
                 unused=[6]: 
                     candidate1:>=12: none.
                     candidate2:<=4: choose 6? 6<=4? no. fail.
            try start=8: 
                 unused=[2,3,6,7]
                 last=8.
                 candidate1:>=12: none.
                 candidate2:<=4: choose 3.
                 last=3.
                 candidate1:>=7: choose 6 (>=3+5=8) -> 6<8, 7<8? -> fail.
                 then choose candidate2:<= -2: fail.
            try start=6: 
                 unused=[2,3,7,8]
                 last=6.
                 candidate1:>=11: none.
                 candidate2:<=1: choose 2? 2<=1? no. fail.
            return false.
        so answer=4.

 It works.

 Therefore, the editorial solution is:

   Sort the array of heights.
   Use binary search on X in the range [0, 10^9].
   For a fixed mid=X, the can(mid) function does:
        - Collect a set of candidate starts: 
             candidates = { 
                 the smallest element (A[0]), 
                 the largest element (A[n-1]), 
                 the element at index n/2 (median index), 
                 the element at index n/2-1 (if exists), 
                 the element at index n/2+1 (if exists),
                 the first element of the largest cluster (by grouping consecutive elements with gap<X), 
                 the last element of the largest cluster 
             }
        - For each candidate start in the set (remove duplicates), do:
             unused = a sorted multiset of the entire array.
             remove one occurrence of the candidate start.
             last = candidate start.
             for i in range(1, n):
                 candidate1 = the smallest element in unused that is >= last+X.
                 if candidate1 exists, use it and remove it.
                 else, find candidate2 = the largest element in unused that is <= last-X.
                     if candidate2 exists and the difference is>=X, use it and remove it.
                 if neither exists, break early.
             if we used all elements, return true.
        - If any candidate start works, return true; else, return false.

   - Then the answer is the maximum X for which can(X) returns true.

 Note: The largest cluster is determined by scanning the sorted array and grouping consecutive elements with difference <X.

 This solution is O( (number of starts) * n * log n * log(10^9) ), and the number of starts is at most 7, so it is O(7 * 30 * n log n) = 210 * n * log n, which is about 210 * 500000 * 19 = 1995000000, which is 2e9 operations in the worst-case in C++ which may be borderline in 1 second, but optimizations and the fact that the set-based greedy might break early may help.

 In practice, the unused set is initially large, but as we progress, it becomes smaller. The constant factors are high, but 2e9 might be borderline in C++ in 1 second on a fast machine.

 We hope that the breaks early in the for loop will help. 

 Alternatively, we can use a Fenwick tree or segment tree to maintain the unused elements and then do the lower_bound in O(log n) without using a set which is O(n) per? 

 But the set-based is O(n log n) per start anyway.

 Given the constraints, we output this solution.
