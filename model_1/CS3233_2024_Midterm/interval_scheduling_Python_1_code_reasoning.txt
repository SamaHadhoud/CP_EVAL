 We are going to follow the editorial exactly.
 Steps:
 1. Parse the input: first integer N, then N lines of intervals in "HH:MM - HH:MM"
 2. Convert each time string to total minutes (integer) for easier computation.
 3. We note the constraints: first interval's start is fixed, last interval's end is fixed.
 4. We use binary search on L (the minimum interval length we are trying to achieve) from 0 up to (last_end - first_start).
 5. In the feasibility function for a candidate L:
      - We start from the last interval and move backwards.
      - For the last interval: 
            end = last_end (fixed)
            start = min(original_start, last_end - L)   [we cannot start earlier than the original start? Actually, condition 1 says the amended interval must include the original. So we can extend the start earlier? But note: condition 2 says the opening time (start of first) remains unchanged, so we cannot change the start of the first. However, for other intervals, we can extend the start earlier? Actually, the condition 1 only requires that the amended interval includes the original. But condition 2 only constrains the first start and the last end. For the others, we can extend both ends.

    However, note the constraint: "The amended time interval for each wave must be inclusive of the original time interval". This means:
        For wave i: the amended start must be <= the original start and the amended end must be >= the original end? 
        Actually, inclusive means the original interval is contained within the amended one. So:
            amended_start <= original_start and amended_end >= original_end.

    But wait: the problem says "extend" and not shorten. So we can only make the interval larger by starting earlier and ending later? However, condition 2 says the opening (first start) and closing (last end) are fixed. So for the first interval, we cannot change the start? Then we can only extend the end? Similarly, the last interval cannot extend the end? But we can extend the start to be earlier? However, condition 2 says the opening time (start of first) is fixed. It does not say the start of the others. But condition 1: we can extend the start of an interval earlier? But then the previous interval's end must be at most that start? 

    However, the editorial uses:
        For the last interval: 
            end = last_end (fixed)
            start = min(original_start, last_end - L)   -> this might set the start earlier than the original? But condition 1: the amended interval must include the original. So if we set the start earlier, then the original start is still in the interval? Yes, because the amended interval is [A, B] and we require A<=original_start and B>=original_end.

    But note: we are allowed to extend the start to be earlier? However, condition 2 does not forbid that for the last interval? Condition 2 only says the closing time (end of last) remains unchanged. And the opening time (start of first) remains unchanged. So yes, we can extend the start of the last interval to be earlier.

    However, the feasibility check in the editorial also sets the start as min(original_start, last_end-L). Why min? Because we cannot set the start later than the original_start? Actually, condition 1 requires that the amended interval must include the original. So the amended start must be <= original_start. Therefore, we cannot set the start to be after the original_start. So we can set it to any time <= original_start. But to maximize the chance of having length L, we set the start as late as possible? Actually, we set the start to the maximum value that is <= original_start and such that the length is at least L? But note: we require the length to be at least L: so we need start <= last_end - L. Therefore, we set the start to min(original_start, last_end - L) ? 

    Actually, we have two constraints for the start of the last interval:
        constraint1: start <= original_start   (to include the original interval)
        constraint2: start <= last_end - L     (to have length at least L)

    So the latest we can set the start is min(original_start, last_end - L). But note: setting it to a later value (i.e., as close to the original as possible) is better for the previous intervals? Because the previous interval's end is set to this start. So we want to leave as much room as possible for the previous intervals? Therefore, we set the start to the minimum of these two? Actually, the minimum of the two would be the more constraining? 

    Example: 
        original_start = 100, last_end = 200, L=50.
        Then last_end-L = 150.
        But we cannot set the start to 150 because then the interval [150,200] does not include [100,200]? Actually, the original interval was [100,200]? Then [150,200] does not include 100? So that's invalid. Therefore, we must set the start to at most 100? Then we set the start to min(100, 150) = 100. Then the length is 100 (200-100) which is >=50.

    So the min is correct: we are taking the most constraining upper bound (because we cannot exceed the original_start) and we also must satisfy the length. But if the original_start is 100 and last_end-L is 150, then we can set the start to 100. But if the original_start is 150 and last_end-L is 100, then we set the start to 100? But then the interval [100,200] includes the original [150,200]? Yes, because 100<=150 and 200>=200. So that's valid.

    Therefore, the formula: start_i = min(original_start_i, end_i - L)   [and we also set the end_i from the next interval's start?]

 6. Then we propagate backwards: for interval i, the end_i is set to the start of interval i+1 (to avoid overlap? Actually, we are making them contiguous? But note: the intervals must be non-overlapping and we are allowed to leave gaps? The problem does not require contiguous intervals? However, the sample output is contiguous? But the problem says: "non-overlapping" and "the ending time of the first interval is not later than the starting time of the second". So they can be non contiguous? 

    However, to maximize the minimum interval, we would want to avoid gaps? Because gaps take away time that could be allocated to the intervals. Therefore, we set the intervals to be contiguous: the end of interval i equals the start of interval i+1.

    But note: condition 1: the amended interval must include the original. If we set the intervals contiguous, then we might force an interval to start earlier than necessary? Actually, we are free to leave gaps? However, the feasibility function in the editorial uses contiguous intervals? 

    The editorial says: 
        For the last interval: 
            B[-1] = last_end
            A[-1] = min(s_list[-1], last_end - L)
        Then for i from n-2 down to 0:
            B[i] = A[i+1]   -> so the end of interval i is the start of interval i+1 (making contiguous)
            A[i] = min(s_list[i], B[i] - L)

    Then we check:
        A[0] must equal first_start? Why? Condition 2: the start of the first interval is fixed. So we require the computed start of the first interval to be the original first_start? 

    But note: in the propagation, we set A[0] = min(s_list[0], B[0]-L) and then we set B[0] = A[1]. Then we require A[0]==first_start? Because we cannot change the first start? Condition 2.

 7. Also, we must check that the end of each interval is at least the original end? Because condition 1: the amended interval must include the original. So for interval i: 
        A[i] <= s_list[i]   (because we set A[i] = min(s_list[i], ...) so it's <= s_list[i])
        and we require B[i] >= e_list[i]. 

    In the feasibility function, after setting the intervals, we check for each i: if B[i] < e_list[i] then it's invalid.

 8. Then we run the binary search to find the maximum L for which feasible(L) is True.

 9. Then we reconstruct the schedule for that optimal L.

 However, note: the problem does not require contiguous intervals? But the sample outputs are contiguous. And the editorial uses contiguous. Why?

    Explanation: if we leave gaps, then we can always shift some time from the gap to one of the adjacent intervals, which might allow increasing the minimum interval? But our goal is to maximize the minimum interval. Having gaps does not help because we can always assign the gap time to an interval to make it longer. Therefore, an optimal solution will have contiguous intervals? 

    Therefore, the editorial's contiguous assignment is justified.

 Implementation:

    Steps:
      - Parse N and the intervals.
      - Convert each time to minutes.
      - Define first_start = s_list[0] and last_end = e_list[-1].
      - Define the feasibility function as above.

    However, note: in the backward propagation, we set:
        for the last interval: 
            end = last_end
            start = min(s_list[-1], last_end - L)

        for i from n-2 down to 0:
            end_i = start_{i+1}   (so the next interval's start is the current interval's end)
            start_i = min(s_list[i], end_i - L)

        Then we check:
            start_0 == first_start? (must be the original start of the first interval)
            and for every i: end_i >= e_list[i]? 

    But note: the condition for the first interval: 
        We set start_0 = min(s_list[0], end_0 - L) and we require that it equals first_start (which is s_list[0]).
        How can we ensure that? 
            We require: min(s_list[0], end_0 - L) == s_list[0]

        This implies: s_list[0] <= end_0 - L   OR   if s_list[0] > end_0 - L, then we set start_0 = end_0 - L, but then we require end_0 - L == s_list[0]? 

        Actually, the condition must hold: 
            s_list[0] <= end_0 - L   is necessary? Because if end_0 - L < s_list[0], then we set start_0 = end_0 - L, which is less than s_list[0]? Then we have start_0 = end_0 - L, and we require that to be s_list[0]? But that would force end_0 = s_list[0] + L, which might be too large? 

        Actually, we don't require the start_0 to be exactly s_list[0]? Condition 2: the start of the first interval must remain unchanged? So we require the computed start_0 to be exactly s_list[0]. Therefore, the feasibility condition must check: 
            if we get start_0 != s_list[0], then it's infeasible.

        How to ensure? 
            We set: start_0 = min(s_list[0], end_0 - L)
            and we require start_0 = s_list[0]. Therefore, we require:
                s_list[0] <= end_0 - L   must be true? Because if not, then we set start_0 = end_0 - L, and then we have end_0 - L = s_list[0]? But then we have start_0 = s_list[0]. So actually, we get s_list[0] in both cases? 

        However, if we set start_0 = min(s_list[0], end_0 - L) and we get a value that is not s_list[0], then we have a problem? Actually, if we set it to end_0 - L, then we get start_0 = end_0 - L. Then we require that to be equal to s_list[0]. So we must have end_0 - L = s_list[0]. But that might not be the case? 

        Correction: the condition in the feasibility function checks at the end: 
            if A[0] != first_start: return False.

        So if we set A[0] to end_0 - L and that does not equal s_list[0], then it returns false.

        Therefore, the propagation might set A[0] to a value that is not s_list[0]? Then we reject the candidate L.

    Example: 
        Input: 
            2
            19:01 - 19:02
            19:03 - 19:04

        Convert: 
            first_start = 19*60+1 = 1141
            last_end = 19*60+4 = 1144

        For L=2:
            last interval (i=1): 
                B[1] = 1144
                A[1] = min(1143, 1144-2) = min(1143,1142)=1142 -> so the last interval becomes [1142,1144] -> length=2, which is >=2? and includes [1143,1144]? because 1142<=1143 and 1144>=1144 -> valid.

            then for i=0:
                B[0] = A[1] = 1142
                A[0] = min(1141, 1142-2)=min(1141,1140)=1140

            Then we check: A[0] must be 1141? but it's 1140 -> not equal -> infeasible.

        Then we try L=1:
            last interval: 
                A[1] = min(1143, 1144-1)=min(1143,1143)=1143
                B[1]=1144
            then i=0:
                B[0]=A[1]=1143
                A[0]=min(1141, 1143-1)=min(1141,1142)=1141 -> which is the original first start.

            Then we check: 
                for interval0: end=1143 >= 1142? -> 1143>=1142 -> valid.
                for interval1: end=1144>=1144 -> valid.

            So L=1 is feasible.

        Then we output:
            interval0: 19:01 - 19:03? -> 1141 to 1143 -> 19:01 to 19:03? 
            interval1: 19:03 - 19:04.

        But the sample input 2 is:
            2
            19:01 - 19:02
            19:03 - 19:04

        and the sample output is:
            19:01 - 19:03
            19:03 - 19:04

        So that matches.

 10. However, note: the propagation sets the intervals to be contiguous. But what if the original intervals were not contiguous? We are allowed to extend the intervals to cover the gaps? Condition 1: we must include the original interval. Condition 2: the first start and last end are fixed. So if we leave a gap, we could extend the next interval to start earlier? But the propagation we do is contiguous. And the editorial uses contiguous.

    Why is contiguous optimal? Because if we have a gap, we can always extend the end of the previous interval and the start of the next interval to cover the gap, which might help in making the intervals longer? Actually, we are constrained by the requirement to include the original interval. So we can extend arbitrarily? But the propagation we do is the most greedy: we set the next interval's start as the end of the current, so we are using the entire timeline without gaps. This maximizes the total time available for the intervals? And we are distributing the gaps to the intervals? 

    Therefore, the contiguous assignment is optimal.

 11. Edge: the intervals are in the same day, between 16:00 and 23:59.

 12. We assume the total time in minutes is at most (23:59 - 16:00) = 7*60+59 = 479 minutes. Then the binary search runs in O(log(479)) which is about 9 iterations, and each feasibility check is O(N) (N<=200). So it's efficient.

 13. However, note: the total time for the entire day is more, but we are only considering from first_start to last_end? 

 14. Implementation: 
        We'll write helper functions: to_minutes and to_time.

 15. Let's code accordingly.

 16. One more note: the backward propagation must set the intervals without gaps? And we are setting the end of interval i to the start of interval i+1? Then we are making the intervals contiguous? And that's what we see in the sample outputs.

 17. But note: the problem says "non-overlapping", and contiguous is non-overlapping? Yes.

 18. We'll run the binary search for L from 0 to (last_end - first_start). 

 19. However, note: the maximum possible L is at most (last_end - first_start) (if we have only one interval, but we have n>=2, so the entire time divided by n? but we are maximizing the minimum, so the maximum L cannot exceed the entire time span? Actually, the entire time span is last_end - first_start, and if we have n intervals, the minimum length cannot exceed (last_end - first_start)/(n) in a contiguous assignment? But we are doing contiguous and the intervals might be forced to be longer? Actually, the constraints of the original intervals might force the minimum to be lower? 

    But the binary search range is [0, last_end - first_start] which is safe.

 20. Now, we code the feasibility function as described.

 21. After finding the maximum L, we run the propagation again to get the actual intervals and output.

 22. But note: the problem says "if there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them". We output the one from the backward propagation for the optimal L.

 23. Let's test with sample1:

        Input: 
            3
            19:00 - 20:00
            21:08 - 21:24
            22:00 - 22:46

        Convert to minutes:
            interval0: 19:00 -> 1140, 20:00 -> 1200
            interval1: 21:08 -> 1268, 21:24 -> 1284
            interval2: 22:00 -> 1320, 22:46 -> 1366

        first_start = 1140, last_end = 1366.

        We want to find L.

        How about the maximum L? The entire time is 1366-1140 = 226 minutes. Divided by 3? about 75 minutes per interval? 

        The sample output has intervals of lengths: 
            interval0: 19:00 to 20:15 -> 75 minutes
            interval1: 20:15 to 21:30 -> 75 minutes? Actually, 20:15 to 21:30 is 75 minutes? 1 hour 15 minutes -> 75 minutes? 
            interval2: 21:31 to 22:46 -> 75 minutes? 21:31 to 22:46 is 1 hour 15 minutes -> 75 minutes? 

        But wait: 21:30 to 21:31 is not contiguous? The sample output has:
            "19:00 - 20:15"
            "20:15 - 21:30"
            "21:31 - 22:46"

        Why the gap? Actually, the propagation in the editorial for the optimal L? 

        However, the editorial sample output has a gap of 1 minute? That is non-overlapping and contiguous? Actually, contiguous means no gap? But here there is a gap. 

        But condition: non-overlapping and the end of one is not later than the start of the next? So gaps are allowed? 

        However, our feasibility function uses contiguous (without gaps). How did the sample output have a gap? 

        Actually, the editorial solution for the sample input 1 is:

            "19:00 - 20:15"
            "20:15 - 21:30"
            "21:31 - 22:46"

        Why the gap? 

        Let me recompute the feasibility for L=75:

          Start from last interval (i=2):
              end2 = 1366
              start2 = min(1320, 1366-75) = min(1320, 1291) = 1291? -> but then the interval [1291,1366] (which is 21:31 to 22:46) -> length=75? 

          Then i=1:
              end1 = start2 = 1291
              start1 = min(1268, 1291-75) = min(1268, 1216) = 1216? -> but 1216 is 20:16? Actually, 20:16 is 20*60+16=1216? But the original start for interval1 is 21:08 (1268). Then the interval [1216,1291] (20:16 to 21:31) -> length=75? 

          Then i=0:
              end0 = start1 = 1216
              start0 = min(1140, 1216-75) = min(1140, 1141) -> 1140? -> so the interval [1140,1216] (19:00 to 20:16) -> length=76? 

          Then we check: 
              start0 = 1140 -> matches the original start? -> yes.
              For interval0: end0=1216 (20:16) >= 1200 (20:00) -> yes.
              For interval1: end1=1291 (21:31) >= 1284 (21:24) -> yes? 1291>=1284 -> yes.
              For interval2: end2=1366>=1366 -> yes.

          But the sample output has:
              interval0: 19:00 to 20:15 -> 75 minutes? (19:00 to 20:15 is 75 minutes: 1 hour 15 minutes)
              But we computed 19:00 to 20:16 -> 76 minutes? 

          Why the difference? 

          The editorial sample output is:
            19:00 - 20:15
            20:15 - 21:30
            21:31 - 22:46

          So the first interval ends at 20:15 (which is 20*60+15=1215 minutes). Then the second starts at 20:15 and ends at 21:30 (21*60+30=1290). Then the third starts at 21:31 (1291) and ends at 22:46 (1366).

          Why did our propagation for L=75 produce 20:16? 

          Because for the last interval we set start2=1291? Then the second interval ends at 1291. Then we set the second interval's start to min(1268, 1291-75)=min(1268,1216)=1216? Then the first interval ends at 1216? 

          But 1216 is 20:16? 

          How can we get 1215? 

          Actually, note: the propagation sets the intervals to be contiguous? But the sample output has a gap? The second interval ends at 21:30 (1290) and the third starts at 21:31 (1291). So there is a gap of 1 minute.

          Therefore, our propagation method must account for the possibility of gaps? 

          But wait: the editorial says: "For the amended schedule, the intervals must be non-overlapping". They don't have to be contiguous? 

          The problem does not say contiguous. So we can have gaps? 

          How to incorporate gaps? 

          The editorial's feasibility function uses contiguous? But the sample output has a gap. 

          Actually, the editorial solution does not use contiguous? 

          Let me reread the editorial: 
            "For each preceding interval, set its end to the start of the next interval"

          That forces contiguous. But the sample output is not contiguous? 

          Therefore, the editorial solution must be adjusted? 

          Alternatively, the gap in the sample output might be due to the fact that we cannot set the end of the second interval to 21:31? because the original end was 21:24, and we are only allowed to extend? So the end must be at least 21:24. But 21:30 is 21*60+30=1290, and 21:31=1291. 

          Why did the editorial sample output set the third interval to start at 21:31? 

          Actually, the problem says: the amended interval must include the original. The original third interval was 22:00-22:46. The amended third interval is 21:31-22:46. This includes the original? 
            21:31 <= 22:00? -> yes, because 21:31 is before 22:00? But wait: the original third interval started at 22:00, so the amended third interval starts at 21:31 which is earlier. So it includes the original? 

          Then why the gap? 

          The gap is because the second interval must end at a time that is at least 21:24? But the amended second interval ends at 21:30? Then the third interval starts at 21:31? So the gap is between 21:30 and 21:31? 

          How can we model this? 

          Actually, the propagation we did was:
              For interval i: 
                 end_i = start_{i+1}

          But the problem does not require contiguous. So we can set:
              end_i <= start_{i+1]   (non-overlapping condition: the ending time is not later than the starting time of the next)

          Therefore, we have more freedom: we can set the end_i to any value between [max(original_end_i, start_i+L), start_{i+1}]? 

          But we want to maximize the minimum L? How does having gaps affect? 

          Actually, we can always close the gap and assign the gap to one of the intervals? So why leave a gap? 

          However, the sample output leaves a gap? 

          Let me see: 
            Original intervals: 
                [19:00,20:00] -> length 60
                [21:08,21:24] -> length 16
                [22:00,22:46] -> length 46

            We want to maximize the minimum interval. The sample output sets each to 75? But wait: 
                interval0: 19:00 to 20:15 -> 75
                interval1: 20:15 to 21:30 -> 75
                interval2: 21:31 to 22:46 -> 75

            The gap is 1 minute. Why not assign that gap to one of the intervals? 

            If we assign the gap to the second interval: then the second interval becomes 20:15 to 21:31 -> 76 minutes? Then the third becomes 21:31 to 22:46 -> 75. Then the minimum is still 75? 

            Or assign to the third: then the third becomes 21:30 to 22:46 -> 76 minutes? minimum still 75.

            So the gap doesn't help? Then why not use contiguous? 

          But in the propagation we did, we forced contiguous and we got the first interval 76 minutes? Why not 75? 

          How did the sample output achieve 75 for the first? 

          They set:
              interval0: 1140 to 1215 (75 minutes) -> end0=1215
              interval1: 1215 to 1290 (75 minutes) -> end1=1290
              interval2: 1291 to 1366 (75 minutes) -> but then we have a gap from 1290 to 1291.

          How can we model this? 

          The editorial approach (contiguous) produces the maximum minimum interval? 

          Actually, the sample output is contiguous in the first two, but a gap before the last. 

          Alternative approach: we can do a two-pass: 
            Forward propagation for the starts and backward for the ends? 

          Known: the start of the first interval is fixed, the end of the last is fixed.

          We want to assign:
            Let S_i be the start of interval i, E_i the end.
            Constraints:
                S_0 = first_start
                E_{n-1} = last_end
                For each i: S_i <= original_start_i and E_i >= original_end_i.
                For each i: E_i - S_i >= L
                For each i: E_i <= S_{i+1]   (non-overlapping)

          And we want to maximize L.

          We can do a greedy: 
            Fix L, then:
              Start with S_0 = first_start.
              For i from 0 to n-1:
                 We set E_i = max(original_end_i, S_i + L)
                 Then for the next interval, we set S_{i+1] = E_i?  -> contiguous? 

          But wait: we are allowed to have gaps? Then we could set S_{i+1] to be any value >= E_i? But to minimize the use of time, we would set S_{i+1] = E_i? 

          However, we also have the constraint that S_{i+1] <= original_start_{i+1]? 

          Actually, condition: the amended interval for wave i+1 must include the original, so S_{i+1] <= original_start_{i+1]? 

          Therefore, we cannot set S_{i+1] arbitrarily? 

          So the propagation:

            S_0 = first_start
            E_0 = max(original_end_0, S_0+L)

            Then for i=1:
                S_1 = min(original_start_1, E_0)   ??? -> but we require S_1 <= original_start_1 and also S_1>=E_0? Actually, non-overlapping: we require E_0<=S_1. So we set S_1 = max(E_0, ?) and also <= original_start_1? 

            How about: 
                S_1 = min(original_start_1, max(E_0, ???))

            Actually, to satisfy the non-overlapping: S_1 must be at least E_0. And to satisfy including the original: S_1<=original_start_1.

            Then we set S_1 = max(E_0, ...) but we don't have an upper bound from the next? 

            Alternatively, we can do:

                S_0 = first_start
                E_0 = max(original_end_0, S_0+L)   [but we cannot extend beyond the next interval?]

            But the next interval must start at least at E_0? and also we have the constraint on the start of the next interval: it must be <= original_start_1. Therefore, if max(original_end_0, S_0+L) > original_start_1, then we have a problem? 

            Then we set E_0 = max(original_end_0, S_0+L) and then we require E_0 <= original_start_1? If not, then L is too large? 

            Then for the next interval: 
                S_1 = E_0   [because we want to use the minimal start to save time for the rest?]
                E_1 = max(original_end_1, S_1+L)

            Then we require E_1 <= original_start_2? 

            And so on. Then at the end, we require E_{n-1] = last_end.

          But wait: we are setting E_{n-1] = max(original_end_{n-1}, S_{n-1}+L). Then we require that to be <= last_end? But also we require E_{n-1]>=last_end? Actually, condition 2: the last end is fixed? So we require E_{n-1] = last_end? 

          Therefore, we require:
              max(original_end_{n-1}, S_{n-1}+L) = last_end   -> so we must have S_{n-1}+L <= last_end? and also we require original_end_{n-1}<=last_end? 

          But if we set E_{n-1] = max(original_end_{n-1}, S_{n-1}+L) and we require that to be last_end, then we must have:
              last_end = max(original_end_{n-1}, S_{n-1}+L) and last_end is fixed.

          So if max(original_end_{n-1}, S_{n-1}+L) != last_end, then we must adjust? 

          This greedy forward propagation might not work.

 24. Actually, the known solution for this problem (from the editorial) is the backward propagation. But the sample output has a gap? 

      Why the gap in the sample output? 

      In the backward propagation, we set:
          For the last interval: 
              E2 = last_end
              S2 = min(original_start2, E2 - L)

          Then for the second interval:
              E1 = S2   [but the sample output has a gap, so we don't force E1=S2?]

      But the editorial says: 
          "For each preceding interval, set its end to the start of the next interval"

      That forces contiguous.

 25. After checking the sample input1 in the editorial's sample output: 
          The output is contiguous for the first two, but the last has a gap? 
          Actually, the output is:
              19:00 - 20:15
              20:15 - 21:30
              21:31 - 22:46

          Why is there a gap of 1 minute between the second and the third? 

          How did they get 21:31? 
          The third interval: 
              original: 22:00-22:46 -> but they extended the start to 21:31? 
          Then the second interval must end by 21:31? but they ended at 21:30? So there is a gap.

      But note: the non-overlapping condition: the second interval ends at 21:30 and the third starts at 21:31 -> so the second interval ends before the third starts -> valid.

      Why didn't they extend the second interval to 21:31? 
          Because the amended interval for the second must include the original? The original second was 21:08-21:24. If they extend the second to 21:31, then the interval [20:15,21:31] includes [21:08,21:24]? Yes. 

      Then why not do that? 

      The only reason is that they want to maximize the minimum interval length? 
          If they set the second to end at 21:31, then the length becomes 21:31 - 20:15 = 76 minutes? 
          and the third becomes 21:31 to 22:46 -> 75 minutes? 
          then the minimum is 75? same as before.

      So it doesn't matter? 

      But the problem says: output any valid solution.

 26. How can we allow gaps in the backward propagation? 

      We are currently setting:
          E_i = S_{i+1]

      But we can set E_i <= S_{i+1]. To save time for the next interval, we would set E_i as late as possible? But we want to maximize the current interval? 

      Actually, to maximize the current interval, we would set E_i as late as possible? But we have a constraint: the next interval must start at least at E_i, and the next interval has its own constraints.

      Alternatively, we can do: 
          Start from the last interval: 
             E_{n-1] = last_end
             S_{n-1] = min(original_start_{n-1], last_end - L)   [so the last interval has length at least L and includes the original?]

          Then for i = n-2 down to 0:
             We require: 
                 S_i <= original_start_i
                 E_i >= original_end_i
                 E_i <= S_{i+1]   (non-overlapping)
                 E_i - S_i >= L

             We want to set E_i as large as possible to leave more room for the previous intervals? 

             So we set: 
                 E_i = min(S_{i+1], max(original_end_i, S_i + L))   -> but we don't know S_i yet.

          Actually, we are going backwards, and we want to set the current interval to be as long as possible? But we are constrained by the original_start_i? 

          Instead, we set:
             We set E_i = min(S_{i+1], max(original_end_i, ?)) 

          How about: 
             We set E_i = min(S_{i+1], max(original_end_i, ???) but we also have to set S_i = min(original_start_i, E_i - L)   [because we want the start as late as possible? to leave room for the previous?]

          Actually, to leave room for the previous, we want S_i to be as large as possible? 

          Therefore, we set:
             S_i = min(original_start_i, S_{i+1] - L)   ??? -> but then E_i must be at least max(original_end_i, S_i+L) and at most S_{i+1]. 

          How about: 
             Let candidate_S = min(original_start_i, S_{i+1] - L)
             Then we set S_i = candidate_S.
             Then we set E_i = max(original_end_i, candidate_S + L)

             But we require E_i <= S_{i+1]. 

          Then we check: 
             if E_i <= S_{i+1]: then valid.
             else: not valid.

          Then we have: 
             For i: 
                 S_i = min(original_start_i, S_{i+1] - L)   [if we want to leave as much room as possible for the previous?]
                 E_i = max(original_end_i, S_i + L)

          Then we move to i-1.

          But note: the start of the first must be fixed? Then we check at the end: S_0 == first_start.

      Let's test with sample1 and L=75:

          last interval (i=2): 
              S2 = min(original_start2, last_end - L) = min(1320, 1366-75)=min(1320,1291)=1291
              E2 = max(original_end2, S2+L)=max(1366, 1291+75)=max(1366,1366)=1366 -> valid? and we require E2=last_end? yes.

          Then i=1:
              S1 = min(original_start1, S2 - L)=min(1268, 1291-75)=min(1268,1216)=1216
              E1 = max(original_end1, S1+L)=max(1284,1216+75)=max(1284,1291)=1291
              Now we require E1<=S2? 1291<=1291 -> valid.

          Then i=0:
              S0 = min(original_start0, S1 - L)=min(1140, 1216-75)=min(1140,1141)=1140
              E0 = max(original_end0, S0+L)=max(1200,1140+75)=max(1200,1215)=1215
              Then we require E0<=S1? 1215<=1216 -> valid.

          Then we check: S0=1140 matches the fixed start? yes.

          Then the intervals are:
            [1140,1215] -> 19:00 to 20:15 -> length 75
            [1216,1291] -> 20:16 to 21:31 -> length 75? but wait, 1291-1216=75? -> yes.
            [1291,1366] -> 21:31 to 22:46 -> length 75.

          But the second interval is [1216,1291]? which is 20:16 to 21:31. However, the sample output second interval is 20:15 to 21:30? 

          Why the difference? 

          We have:
            first: 19:00 to 20:15 -> 1140 to 1215? (20:15 is 20*60+15=1215) -> yes.
            second: 20:16 (1216) to 21:31 (1291) -> but 21:31 is 21*60+31=1291? -> yes.

          The sample output second interval is 20:15 to 21:30? 
            20:15 -> 1215, 21:30->21*60+30=1290.

          How did they get that? 

          They have a gap: the first interval ends at 20:15 (1215) and the second starts at 20:15? but then the second would be [1215, 1290]? and the third [1291,1366]? 

          How to achieve that in our propagation? 

          We set for the second interval: 
              S1 = min(1268, 1291-75)=1216? but the sample output used 1215? 

          Why can we use 1215? 
             For the second interval: 
                 S1 = 1215? which is <= original_start1 (1268) -> valid.
                 then E1 = max(1284, 1215+75)=max(1284,1290)=1290? 
                 and then we require E1<=S2? 1290<=1291 -> valid.

          Then for the first interval: 
                 S0 = min(1140, 1215-75)=min(1140,1140)=1140? 
                 E0 = max(1200,1140+75)=max(1200,1215)=1215? 
                 and then we require E0<=S1? 1215<=1215 -> valid.

          And the last interval: as before.

          So we have a valid schedule with L=75 and the sample output.

          How to get the sample output? 

          We have a choice: in the backward propagation for the second interval, we set:
              S1 = min(original_start1, S2 - L)

          But we set it to 1216? but we could also set it to 1215? 

          Why did we choose 1216? Because we took the minimum of (1268, 1216) -> 1216? 

          Actually, the formula: 
              S_i = min(original_start_i, S_{i+1] - L)

          This gives the latest possible start? to leave more room for the previous intervals? 

          But to leave more room for the previous intervals, we want S_i to be as large as possible? 

          However, the formula for the previous interval: 
              S_{i-1} = min(original_start_{i-1}, S_i - L)

          So if we set S_i to 1215, then the previous interval's end is set to 1215, and then its start is min(1140, 1215-75)=min(1140,1140)=1140? 

          Then the first interval is [1140,1215] which is 75 minutes? 

          But if we set S_i to 1216, then the previous interval's end is 1216, and then its start is min(1140,1216-75)=min(1140,1141)=1140, and then the first interval is [1140,1216] -> 76 minutes? 

          So both are valid. 

          The problem: we want to maximize the minimum interval? Both have minimum=75? 

          But note: in the schedule with the gap, the second interval is [1215,1290] -> 75 minutes? and the first is 75 minutes? and the third is 75 minutes? 
          In the schedule without the gap, the first is 76, the second is 75, the third is 75 -> minimum=75.

          So both are valid and have the same minimum.

          The editorial says: output any valid solution.

      Therefore, we can output either.

      But the sample output chose the one with the gap? 

      How can we adjust our propagation to allow choosing an earlier start? 

      Actually, we are not forced to set S_i = min(original_start_i, S_{i+1]-L)? 

      We can set S_i to any value that satisfies:
          S_i <= original_start_i
          S_i <= S_{i+1] - L   [to have length at least L: we require E_i = max(original_end_i, S_i+L) and then we require E_i <= S_{i+1]? 

          But note: we set E_i = max(original_end_i, S_i+L) and we require E_i <= S_{i+1]. Therefore, we require:
              max(original_end_i, S_i+L) <= S_{i+1]

          So: 
             S_i+L <= S_{i+1]   and   original_end_i <= S_{i+1]

          Therefore, we can choose any S_i that is at most min(original_start_i, S_{i+1]-L) and also we require that S_i+L >= original_end_i? Actually, no: because we set E_i = max(original_end_i, S_i+L), so if S_i+L < original_end_i, then E_i = original_end_i, and then we require original_end_i<=S_{i+1]. 

          But we also require the length: E_i - S_i = max(original_end_i, S_i+L) - S_i >= L? 
             If we set S_i such that S_i+L < original_end_i, then E_i = original_end_i, and then the length = original_end_i - S_i >= L? -> we require original_end_i - S_i >= L.

          So we have two constraints for S_i:
             S_i <= min(original_start_i, S_{i+1] - L)   [from the non-overlapping and the start constraint?] -> actually, from the non-overlapping we only have the condition on E_i, which is max(original_end_i, S_i+L)<=S_{i+1]. And from the length we have: if S_i+L < original_end_i, then we require original_end_i - S_i >= L -> which is S_i <= original_end_i - L.

          Therefore, we can set S_i to any value in the range:
             [max( ??? ), min(original_start_i, S_{i+1]-L, original_end_i - L)]   ??? 

          Actually, the lower bound: we don't have a constraint from the left? Only the non-overlapping from the right and the including condition? 

          But to leave room for the previous intervals, we want to set S_i as large as possible? 

          Therefore, the best choice for S_i is the upper bound: min(original_start_i, S_{i+1]-L, original_end_i - L) ??? 

          However, we also have: the constraint that the interval must have length at least L: 
             if we set S_i = x, then the length is max(original_end_i, x+L) - x = 
                 if x+L >= original_end_i: then length = x+L - x = L.
                 else: then length = original_end_i - x, and we require that >= L -> so x<=original_end_i-L.

          So if we set x = min(original_start_i, S_{i+1]-L, original_end_i - L), then we are safe? 

          But note: we also have to ensure that the end is at most S_{i+1]: 
              if we set x = min(original_start_i, S_{i+1]-L, original_end_i - L), then:
                 E_i = max(original_end_i, x+L) 
                 and we require E_i <= S_{i+1]

              If x+L >= original_end_i, then E_i = x+L <= (S_{i+1]-L)+L = S_{i+1] -> holds.
              If x+L < original_end_i, then E_i = original_end_i, and we require original_end_i <= S_{i+1]. But x <= original_end_i - L, so x+L <= original_end_i, so we don't get a condition from that. But we require original_end_i <= S_{i+1]. 

          Therefore, we must have the additional constraint: original_end_i <= S_{i+1]. 

          How do we enforce that? 

          We have: 
             Condition: we require original_end_i <= S_{i+1]

          But S_{i+1] is fixed from the next interval? 

          So if we have a candidate x, we must check that if x+L < original_end_i, then we require original_end_i <= S_{i+1]. 

          But we can also choose to set x such that x+L>=original_end_i? then we avoid that constraint.

          Therefore, we have two options? 

          Actually, the condition: we can set x to be at least original_end_i - L to avoid the extra constraint? 

          But our upper bound already includes original_end_i - L? 

          How about: 
             We set x = min(original_start_i, S_{i+1]-L)   # this is the latest possible start that satisfies the non-overlapping and the start constraint.
             Then we check: 
                 if x <= original_end_i - L: 
                     then the length = original_end_i - x, which is at least L? because x<=original_end_i-L -> then length>=L.
                     and we require original_end_i <= S_{i+1] -> if not, then we must set x such that x+L>=original_end_i? 
                 else: 
                     then x+L >= original_end_i, so the length is L, and we require x+L <= S_{i+1] -> holds because x<=S_{i+1]-L.

          So if we set x = min(original_start_i, S_{i+1]-L) and we are in the case x<=original_end_i-L, then we require original_end_i<=S_{i+1]. 

          Therefore, we can do:

             x = min(original_start_i, S_{i+1]-L)
             if x <= original_end_i - L:
                 then we require that original_end_i <= S_{i+1]   [if not, then L is not feasible for this interval?]
             else:
                 then it's safe.

          But then we have to check this condition.

      Alternatively, we can do the propagation as:

          S_i = min(original_start_i, S_{i+1]-L)
          E_i = max(original_end_i, S_i+L)

          Then we check two things:
             E_i <= S_{i+1]   [which is always true if S_i+L<=S_{i+1] and original_end_i<=S_{i+1]? 
                 If S_i+L >= original_end_i, then E_i = S_i+L <= (S_{i+1]-L)+L = S_{i+1] -> holds.
                 If S_i+L < original_end_i, then E_i = original_end_i, and we require original_end_i<=S_{i+1] -> so we must check that.

          Therefore, in the feasibility function, after setting S_i and E_i, we check:
             if E_i > S_{i+1]: 
                 return False

          This covers both cases.

      Then we also check at the end: S_0 == first_start? and for each interval: E_i>=original_end_i (which is already taken care of by E_i = max(original_end_i, S_i+L)) and also the length is at least L? 

      Therefore, we adjust the backward propagation to:

          For the last interval i = n-1:
             S_{n-1] = min(original_start_{n-1], last_end - L)
             E_{n-1] = max(original_end_{n-1], S_{n-1] + L)
             # Check: E_{n-1] must be last_end? 
             if E_{n-1] != last_end:
                 return False   # because we cannot extend the last end.

          But wait: we cannot change the last end? So we require E_{n-1] = last_end? 

          Therefore, we require:
             max(original_end_{n-1], S_{n-1] + L) = last_end

          So if that is not true, then we return False.

          Then for i from n-2 down to 0:
             S_i = min(original_start_i, S_{i+1] - L)
             E_i = max(original_end_i, S_i+L)
             if E_i > S_{i+1]:
                 return False

          Then at the end, check S_0 == first_start.

      Let's test sample1 with L=75:

          last interval (i=2):
             S2 = min(1320, 1366-75)=min(1320,1291)=1291
             E2 = max(1366, 1291+75)=max(1366,1366)=1366 -> equals last_end -> valid.

          i=1:
             S1 = min(1268, 1291-75)=min(1268,1216)=1216
             E1 = max(1284,1216+75)=max(1284,1291)=1291
             Check: E1<=S2? 1291<=1291 -> valid.

          i=0:
             S0 = min(1140,1216-75)=min(1140,1141)=1140
             E0 = max(1200,1140+75)=max(1200,1215)=1215
             Check: E0<=S1? 1215<=1216 -> valid.

          Then we check S0=1140? yes.

          But this gives the schedule without the gap.

          How to get the sample output? 

          We want to allow the gap? 

          In the propagation, for i=1, we set S1=1216, but we could also set S1=1215? 

          How can we incorporate the possibility to set an earlier start? 

          We have: 
             In the propagation for i=1: 
                 S1 = min(1268, 1291-75)=1216? 

          But 1291-75=1216? 

          Why not 1215? 

          Because the formula is: S1 = min(1268, 1291-75) = min(1268,1216)=1216.

          So we cannot get 1215 by this formula? 

          How about if we set the last interval differently? 

          In the last interval, we set S2= min(1320, 1366-75)=1291? 

          But if we set S2 to 1290? 
             Then E2 = max(1366, 1290+75)=max(1366,1365)=1366 -> valid.

          Then for i=1:
             S1 = min(1268, 1290-75)=min(1268,1215)=1215
             E1 = max(1284,1215+75)=max(1284,1290)=1290
             Check: E1<=S2? 1290<=1290 -> valid.

          Then for i=0:
             S0 = min(1140,1215-75)=min(1140,1140)=1140
             E0 = max(1200,1140+75)=max(1200,1215)=1215
             Check: E0<=S1? 1215<=1215 -> valid.

          Then we have the sample output.

          But how to choose S2? 

          We set S2 = min(1320, 1366-75)=1291? but we can set it to any value that is <=1320 and <=1366-75=1291? and also we require that max(1366, S2+75)=1366? 
             So we require: S2+75 <=1366? -> S2<=1291.
             And also, we require the last end to be 1366, so we require max(1366, S2+75)=1366 -> which means S2+75<=1366? -> S2<=1291.
             And the original_start2 is 1320, so S2 can be as low as ...? 

          But we also have the condition: the last interval must include the original? 
             The original last interval is [1320,1366]. The amended last interval is [S2,1366]. To include the original: 
                 S2 <=1320 and 1366>=1366.
             So S2 can be any value in [?, 1320] and also we require S2+75<=1366 -> S2<=1291.

          How to choose the best S2? 

          To help the previous interval, we want to set S2 as small as possible? 
             Because then for the previous interval: 
                 S1 = min(1268, S2-75) -> will be smaller if S2 is smaller? 

          But we want to maximize the minimum interval length? 

          However, in the propagation we are given L, and we are only checking feasibility.

          And the schedule for a fixed L is not unique. 

          The problem: output any valid solution.

          Therefore, we can choose any S2 in the range [min_value, 1291]? 

          What is the min_value? 
             The last interval must also satisfy: the length = 1366 - S2 >= L? -> already ensured by S2<=1291 (since 1366-1291=75>=75).

          And the condition: include the original? we have S2<=1320.

          But also, we have the condition: the start of the last interval can be as early as we want? 

          Actually, there is no lower bound from the last interval's start? 

          However, the previous interval must end at most at S2? 

          To make the previous interval have more room, we might want to set S2 as large as possible? 
             Because then the previous interval's end can be as large as S2, and then its start can be as large as possible? 

          But in the propagation, we set for the previous interval: 
                 S1 = min(1268, S2-75)

          If we set S2=1291, then S1=min(1268,1291-75)=min(1268,1216)=1216.
          If we set S2=1290, then S1=min(1268,1290-75)=min(1268,1215)=1215.

          How does this affect the first interval? 
             For the first interval: 
                 if S1=1216: then S0=min(1140,1216-75)=1140, and E0=1215 or 1216? -> we computed 1215? 
                 if S1=1215: then S0=min(1140,1215-75)=min(1140,1140)=1140, and E0=1215.

          So both work.

          But note: in the first case (S2=1291) we have the first interval: [1140,1215] and the second: [1216,1291] -> so a gap from 1215 to 1216? 
          In the second case (S2=1290) we have the first: [1140,1215] and the second: [1215,1290] -> contiguous, and then the last: [1290,1366]? -> but wait, we set the last to [1290,1366]? and then the second ends at 1290 and the last starts at 1290 -> contiguous.

          But the sample output has the last starting at 1291? 

          We set the last interval in the sample-output-like to be [1290,1366]? but the sample output last is 21:31-22:46 which is 1291 to 1366.

          How to achieve 1291? 

          We set S2=1291? then the last is [1291,1366]. Then the second must end by 1291? and we set the second to [1215,1290]? but then we have a gap from 1290 to 1291.

          How to achieve that in the propagation? 

          For the second interval: 
             S1 = 1215
             E1 = max(1284,1215+75)=max(1284,1290)=1290   [because 1215+75=1290]

          Then the last interval: 
             S2 = min(1320, ?) -> but note: in the last interval propagation, we only know that we require S2>=1290? (non-overlapping) and we require the last end=1366.

          And we are free to choose S2 as long as S2<=1320 and S2<=1291 (from the length constraint) and we require the last interval to include [1320,1366]? 
             So we require S2<=1320 and the end is 1366.

          We can choose S2=1291? then the last interval is [1291,1366] -> which has length 75, and includes [1320,1366]? -> valid.

          How to propagate that? 

          In the backward propagation for the last interval, we have the freedom to choose any S2 in [min_value, 1291]? 

          But the propagation method we have is deterministic: 
              S2 = min(1320, 1366-75)=1291.

          Then for the second interval: 
              S1 = min(1268, 1291-75)=1216.

          Then we cannot get the sample output.

      Therefore, to match the sample output, we would need to do the propagation for the last interval differently? 

      How about: 
          In the last interval, we are allowed to set S2 to any value in the range [low_bound, 1291], where low_bound is not specified? 

          But we also have the constraint: the last interval must have length at least L: 
              1366 - S2 >= L -> S2<=1291.

          and including: S2<=1320.

          and non-overlapping: S2>=E1? 

          But we don't know E1 yet? because we are going backwards.

      Alternatively, we can do a forward propagation after the backward to adjust the gaps? 

      Given the complexity, and since the problem allows any valid solution, we can output the schedule from the backward propagation as described in the editorial (which is contiguous in the propagation) and if that has the same minimum L, it's acceptable.

      The sample input1 in the problem's sample output is one valid solution, and our propagation with S2=1291 and then the rest gives another valid solution.

      But the sample output provided in the problem is different.

      Since the problem says "any valid solution", we can output either.

      Let's output using the following deterministic rule in the backward propagation for the last interval: 
          S_i = min(original_start_i, last_end - L)

      and for the other intervals: 
          S_i = min(original_start_i, S_{i+1]-L)

      Then we get the schedule without gaps? 

      However, the sample input2 must be:

          2
          19:01 - 19:02
          19:03 - 19:04

      We did this above and got L=1, and the schedule:
          [1141,1143] -> 19:01 to 19:03
          [1143,1144] -> 19:03 to 19:04

      which matches the sample output.

      Therefore, we'll use the deterministic backward propagation as in the editorial.

      And for sample1, we output:

          19:00 - 20:15   (1140 to 1215)  -> but wait, we computed for sample1 with L=75: 
               first: [1140,1215] -> 19:00 to 20:15? 20:15 is 20*60+15=1215 -> matches.
               second: [1216,1291] -> 20:16 to 21:31? -> 20:16 is 20*60+16=1216, and 21:31 is 21*60+31=1291.
               third: [1291,1366] -> 21:31 to 22:46.

      But the sample output is:

          19:00 - 20:15
          20:15 - 21:30
          21:31 - 22:46

      So ours is slightly different but valid.

      Therefore, we output:

          19:00 - 20:15
          20:16 - 21:31
          21:31 - 22:46

      However, note: the sample output has the second interval ending at 21:30 and the third starting at 21:31 -> a gap of 1 minute.
      Ours has the second interval ending at 21:31 and the third starting at 21:31 -> contiguous.

      But condition: non-overlapping? 
          "the ending time of the first interval is not later than the starting time of the second" -> our second interval ends at 21:31 and the next starts at 21:31 -> not later? it's equal -> allowed.

      So contiguous is allowed.

      Therefore, we'll use the following in the feasibility check and reconstruction:

          for last interval i = n-1:
              S[i] = min(original_start_i, last_end - L)
              E[i] = max(original_end_i, S[i] + L)
              if E[i] != last_end: return False   (for the last interval)

          for i from n-2 down to 0:
              S[i] = min(original_start_i, S[i+1] - L)
              E[i] = max(original_end_i, S[i] + L)
              if E[i] > S[i+1]: 
                  return False

          Then check S[0] == first_start.

      And output the schedule: for each interval i, output to_time(S[i]) and to_time(E[i])

 27. But wait, in the last interval we require the end to be exactly last_end? 
        We set E[n-1] = max(original_end_{n-1}, S[n-1]+L)
        and then we require that to be last_end? 

        Why must it be last_end? 
            Condition 2: the closing time of the restaurant (which is the end of the last interval) must remain unchanged.

        Therefore, we must have E[n-1] = last_end.

        So if max(original_end_{n-1}, S_{n-1]+L) != last_end, then we return False.

 28. Let's test sample input2 with L=1:

        last interval (i=1):
            S1 = min(1143, 1144-1)=min(1143,1143)=1143
            E1 = max(1144, 1143+1)=max(1144,1144)=1144 -> equals last_end -> valid.

        i=0:
            S0 = min(1141, 1143-1)=min(1141,1142)=1141
            E0 = max(1142,1141+1)=max(1142,1142)=1142
            Check: E0<=S1? 1142<=1143 -> valid.

        Then S0=1141 matches first_start? valid.

        Output: 
            [1141,1142] -> 19:01-19:02? -> but wait, we extended the first interval to end at 19:02? but the original end was 19:02? and we set to 1142 which is 19:02? 
            and the second: [1143,1144] -> 19:03-19:04.

        But we have a gap from 19:02 to 19:03? 

        However, the sample output is:
            "19:01 - 19:03"
            "19:03 - 19:04"

        Why the difference? 

        Our propagation for the first sample2 output:
            first: [1141,1142] -> 19:01 to 19:02
            second: [1143,1144] -> 19:03 to 19:04

        But then the amended first interval: 
            [19:01,19:02] includes the original [19:01,19:02]? -> yes.
            the amended second: [19:03,19:04] includes the original [19:03,19:04]? -> yes.
            non-overlapping: 19:02<=19:03? -> 19:02 is 1142 and 19:03 is 1143 -> 1142<=1143 -> valid.

        And the first start is 19:01 and last end is 19:04.

        But the sample output has:
            first: 19:01-19:03 -> [1141,1143] -> length 2 minutes? 
            second: 19:03-19:04 -> [1143,1144] -> length 1 minute.

        Why did we get a different solution? 

        Because the minimum interval length in our solution is 1 (the second interval) and the sample output also has minimum interval length 1? 

        And our solution is valid.

        The problem: any valid solution.

        So we can output either.

        But the sample output in the problem is the contiguous one for sample2? 

        Ours has a gap of 1 minute (from 19:02 to 19:03)? 

        How to get rid of the gap? 

        We could have chosen for the first interval to end at 19:03? 
            Then the amended first: [19:01,19:03] -> includes [19:01,19:02]? -> yes.
            the second: [19:03,19:04] -> includes [19:03,19:04]? -> yes.
            contiguous.

        Why didn't we get that? 

        In the propagation for the first interval:
            S0 = min(1141, 1143-1)=min(1141,1142)=1141   [we chose the latest start that is allowed?]
            then E0 = max(1142,1141+1)=max(1142,1142)=1142.

        How to get 1143? 

        If we set the first interval to be [1141,1143], then the length=2, which is>=L=1, and we require that it is not later than the next start? and we set the next start to 1143? 

        But in the propagation for the last interval, we set the second interval's start to 1143? 

        Then for the first interval, we are allowed to set its end to 1143? 

        But our propagation sets the end of the first to max(1142,1141+1)=1142? 

        Why not 1143? 

        Because the formula: 
            E0 = max(original_end0, S0+L) = max(1142,1141+1)=max(1142,1142)=1142.

        To get 1143, we would need to extend the end of the first interval beyond the requirement? 

        But the condition: including the original only requires the end>=1142? and the length constraint requires>=1142? 

        However, we are allowed to extend more? 

        But the propagation sets the end to the minimal required: max(1142,1141+1)=1142.

        To get a longer interval, we would need to set it to a value greater than 1142? 

        How about: 
            In the propagation, we set:
                E_i = max(original_end_i, S_i+L)

        This is the minimal end that satisfies the conditions? 

        But we are allowed to set the end to any value>=max(original_end_i, S_i+L) and <=S_{i+1]? 

        To help the next interval, we might want to set the end as large as possible? 

        Then we would set E_i = S_{i+1]? 

        Then the length of the interval i would be S_{i+1]-S_i, which might be > L? 

        But then the length of the interval i is not forced to be exactly the minimal L? 

        And this might allow a larger L? 

        However, in the feasibility function for a fixed L, we only require the length to be at least L.

        Therefore, we can set the end to any value in [max(original_end_i, S_i+L), S_{i+1]].

        How to choose? 

        We want to leave as much room as possible for the previous intervals? 
            But we are going backwards, so the previous intervals are already handled after the current? 

        Actually, the only constraint for the current interval is the next interval's start, which is fixed at the time of processing the current.

        Therefore, we can set the end to the next interval's start? to maximize the length of the current interval? 

        But does it help in maximizing the minimum? 

        It might make the current interval longer, but the minimum might be determined by another interval? 

        Since we are only checking feasibility for a fixed L, we only require the current interval to have at least L minutes.

        Therefore, we can choose any end in the range. 

        To have a contiguous schedule, we can set the end to the next interval's start.

        So we can change the propagation to:

            for i from n-2 down to 0:
                # We set the end of the current interval to the start of the next interval to make contiguous.
                E_i = S_{i+1]
                # But we also require that the current interval has length at least L: 
                #   E_i - S_i >= L   -> S_i <= E_i - L.
                # and the start constraint: S_i<=original_start_i.
                # Therefore, we set:
                S_i = min(original_start_i, E_i - L)
                # Then we require that the interval includes the original: 
                #   E_i >= original_end_i   (which is satisfied because we set E_i = S_{i+1] and we will check later that the next interval's start is at least the next interval's original_start? not exactly, but we also have the condition from the propagation: we haven't checked E_i>=original_end_i)
                # So after setting, we must check: 
                if E_i < original_end_i:
                    return False   # because the amended interval must extend to at least the original end.

        But wait, we are not checking that in the assignment? 

        Alternatively, we can do:

            for i from n-2 down to 0:
                E_i = S_{i+1]   # we make contiguous
                # Then we set the start: 
                S_i = min(original_start_i, E_i - L)
                # Then we check the including condition: 
                if S_i > original_start_i:  # wait, S_i is the amended start, and we require amended start <= original_start_i -> but we set it to min(original_start_i, ...) so it's <= original_start_i.
                if E_i < original_end_i: 
                    return False

        Then we don't need the max? 

        Let me test sample2 with this new approach:

          last interval (i=1) (n=2):
              S1 = min(1143, 1144-1)=min(1143,1143)=1143
              E1 = 1144
              Check: E1>=1144 (original_end1) -> yes.

          i=0:
              E0 = S1 = 1143
              S0 = min(1141, 1143-1)=min(1141,1142)=1141
              Check: E0=1143>=1142 (original_end0) -> yes.

          Then we have:
              [1141,1143] -> 19:01-19:03
              [1143,1144] -> 19:03-19:04

          This matches the sample output.

        And sample1 with L=75:

          last interval (i=2):
              S2 = min(1320, 1366-75)=1291
              E2=1366
              Check:1366>=1366 -> yes.

          i=1:
              E1 = S2 = 1291
              S1 = min(1268, 1291-75)=min(1268,1216)=1216
              Check: E1=1291>=1284 (original_end1) -> yes.

          i=0:
              E0 = S1 = 1216
              S0 = min(1140, 1216-75)=min(1140,1141)=1140
              Check: E0=1216>=1200 -> yes.

          Then the schedule:
             [1140,1216] -> 19:00 to 20:16
             [1216,1291] -> 20:16 to 21:31
             [1291,1366] -> 21:31 to 22:46

          This is contiguous and valid.

        But the sample output for sample1 is not contiguous? 

        Why the sample output for sample1 has a gap? 
            Because they set the last interval to start at 21:31 and the second to end at 21:30.

        How to achieve that with this propagation? 
            We would have to set the last interval's start to 1291, and then set the second interval's end to 1290? 

        But then the second interval's end (1290) is not the last interval's start (1291) -> not contiguous.

        In our propagation, we force contiguous by setting E_i = S_{i+1].

        Therefore, this propagation always produces contiguous schedules.

        The problem does not require contiguous, but allows it.

        And the sample output for sample2 is contiguous.

        So we can use this propagation.

        Let's recap the new feasibility for a fixed L:

          For the last interval (i = n-1):
             S[n-1] = min(original_start_{n-1], last_end - L)
             if last_end - S[n-1] < L:   # not needed if we set it by the min, but we also require including the original start? 
                 actually, we have ensured the length is at least L? 
                    because we set S[n-1] = min(original_start_{n-1], last_end - L) 
                    so S[n-1] <= last_end - L  -> last_end - S[n-1] >= L.
             But also we require including: 
                 S[n-1] <= original_start_{n-1]   (by the min)
                 and last_end >= original_end_{n-1]   (because we cannot change the last_end, and the amended last interval is [S[n-1], last_end] and we require last_end>=original_end_{n-1] -> but the last_end is the original last_end? 
                    However, the last_end in the input is the end of the last interval? and condition 2: we cannot change it.
                    and condition 1: the amended last interval must include the original, so last_end>=original_end_{n-1] -> holds because the original schedule is given and last_end is the original last_end? 
                    Actually, the input last_end is the end of the last interval, and we are not allowed to change it, and the amended last interval must include the original last interval, so last_end must be >= the original last_end? but it is equal.

          Therefore, we don't need an extra check for the last interval? 

          However, we must ensure that the last_end is at least the original_end_{n-1]? -> it is, because the last interval in the input has end = last_end.

          For i from n-2 down to 0:
             E_i = S_{i+1]   (the end of interval i is the start of interval i+1)
             S_i = min(original_start_i, E_i - L)
             if E_i < original_end_i: 
                 return False

          Then after the loop, check S[0]==first_start.

        Let me test sample1 with L=75:

          last interval: S2=min(1320,1366-75)=1291.
          then for i=1: 
             E1 = S2 = 1291
             S1 = min(1268, 1291-75)=min(1268,1216)=1216
             Check: E1=1291>=1284? -> yes.

          then for i=0:
             E0 = S1 = 1216
             S0 = min(1140,1216-75)=1140
             Check: E0=1216>=1200? -> yes.

          Then check: S0=1140? yes.

          So valid.

        But how to get the sample output for sample1? 
            It has the second interval ending at 21:30 (1290) and the last starting at 21:31 (1291) -> not contiguous.

        We would need a different feasibility check that allows gaps.

        Given the time, and since the problem allows any valid solution, we output contiguous.

        But the sample output provided in the problem for sample1 is not contiguous.

        Therefore, we must allow gaps.

        How to allow gaps in the backward propagation without forward? 

        We can do:

          For the last interval: 
             S[n-1] = min(original_start_{n-1], last_end - L)   # This is the latest start we can have for the last interval.
             E[n-1] = last_end   # fixed.
          then for i from n-2 down to 0:
             # We have freedom: we can set the end of interval i to any value in [max(original_end_i, S_i+L), S_{i+1]]
             # To leave as much room as possible for the previous intervals, we set the end of interval i as large as possible: we set it to S_{i+1] (which is the start of the next interval) to maximize the length of interval i, and then we set the start of interval i as large as possible to minimize the use of time for the previous interval? 
             # But actually, we want to set the start of interval i as large as possible to leave room for the previous, so we set:
             #   S_i = min(original_start_i, S_{i+1] - L)   [because the length must be at least L: so if we set the end to S_{i+1], then the start must be at most S_{i+1]-L]
             #   Then we set the end = max(original_end_i, S_i+L)
             #   But then we require end<=S_{i+1] -> holds by the way we set S_i.
             #   And we require including: S_i<=original_start_i and end>=original_end_i.

          However, this is what we did initially in the editorial and it produced for sample1 with L=75 the schedule with the gap inside the second interval and the last being contiguous? 

          Specifically, for sample1:
             last: S2=1291, E2=1366.
             i=1: 
                 S1 = min(1268, 1291-75)=1216
                 E1 = max(1284,1216+75)=1291
                 then we require E1<=S2? 1291<=1291 -> valid.
             i=0: 
                 S0 = min(1140,1216-75)=1140
                 E0 = max(1200,1140+75)=1215
                 then we require E0<=S1? 1215<=1216 -> valid.

          This has a gap between the first and the second: from 1215 to 1216.

          But the sample output has a gap between the second and the last.

          How to get a gap between the second and the last? 

          We would need to set the last interval's start later than the second's end.

          In the propagation for the last interval, we set S2=1291.
          In the propagation for the second interval, we set E1=1291.

          So the second interval ends at 1291, and the last starts at 1291.

          To have a gap, we would need to set the last interval's start to 1291 and the second's end to 1290? 

          How to achieve that? 

          In the propagation for the second interval, we have the freedom to set the end to any value in [max(1284,1216+75), 1291] = [1291,1291] -> only 1291.

          So we cannot set it to 1290.

          Therefore, we cannot get the sample output for sample1 with this propagation.

        Given the complexity and the fact that the problem allows any valid solution, we output the schedule we generate.

        And note: the sample output in the problem for sample1 is also valid, but we generate another valid schedule.

        So we'll use the very first propagation from the editorial (which allows gaps between intervals) but not within an interval's constraints.

        Specifically, the one that does not force the end of interval i to be the start of interval i+1, but only requires that the end of interval i is <= the start of interval i+1.

        We'll use the following for feasibility for a fixed L (from the editorial with a small change to check the end condition for the last interval and the gap condition for others):

          For the last interval (i=n-1):
             S[n-1] = min(original_start_{n-1], last_end - L)
             E[n-1] = max(original_end_{n-1], S[n-1]+L)
             if E[n-1] != last_end:   # because the last_end is fixed
                 return False

          For i from n-2 down to 0:
             S[i] = min(original_start_i, S[i+1] - L)   # note: we use S[i+1] (the next interval's start) here, not the current's end.
             E[i] = max(original_end_i, S[i] + L)
             if E[i] > S[i+1]:   # ensure non-overlapping: the current's end is not later than the next's start.
                 return False

          Then after the loop, check S[0]==first_start.

        This is the same as the first feasibility function we considered, and it passed sample1 and sample2.

        For sample1, it produces:
          19:00 - 20:15
          20:16 - 21:31
          21:31 - 22:46

        For sample2, it produces:
          19:01 - 19:02
          19:03 - 19:04

        But wait, sample2 has a gap from 19:02 to 19:03? 

        How to close that gap in sample2? 
          sample2: 
             first: [1141,1142] -> from 19:01 to 19:02.
             second: [1143,1144] -> from 19:03 to 19:04.
             gap: 1142 to 1143.

        The sample output for sample2 is contiguous.

        Therefore, we might want to try to close the gaps if possible? 

        However, the problem does not require contiguous, and our solution is valid.

        So we output it.

        Given the above, we'll code accordingly.

        Steps in code:
          Parse.
          Convert to minutes.
          Binary search on L from 0 to (last_end - first_start)
          Feasibility function as above.
          Then for the found L, rebuild the schedule and output.

        Let's hope the sample1 and sample2 work.

        We'll run sample2: 
          n=2, first_start=1141, last_end=1144.
          Intervals: [1141,1142] and [1143,1144]

          L=0: always works.
          L=1: 
             last interval (i=1):
                 S1 = min(1143, 1144-1)=min(1143,1143)=1143.
                 E1 = max(1144, 1143+1)=max(1144,1144)=1144. -> equals last_end, good.
             i=0:
                 S0 = min(1141, 1143-1)=min(1141,1142)=1141.
                 E0 = max(1142,1141+1)=max(1142,1142)=1142.
                 Check: E0<=S1? 1142<=1143 -> True.
             Then check S0==1141 -> True. -> feasible.

          So we found L=1, and then we output the intervals as above.

        But the sample output for sample2 is contiguous. 

        Since the problem allows any valid solution, we output ours.

        If the manager asks for the sample1 output specifically, we would need to insert gaps by a different method, but the problem does not require it.

        Therefore, we finalize with this.

 29. Code accordingly.

 30. Edge: minutes are integers, and we are in the same day.

 Let's code accordingly.
