### Approach
To solve this problem, we need to help Edgar determine the minimum trauma rating required to reach at least level \( L \) by completing a subset of available quests. Each quest has a minimum level requirement \( M_i \), a level gain \( X_i \), and a trauma value \( T_i \). Edgar's trauma rating is defined as the sum of the \( K \) largest trauma values among the quests he completes. If he completes fewer than \( K \) quests, his trauma rating is the sum of all trauma values of the completed quests.

#### Key Insights
1. **Problem Complexity**: The constraints involve large values for \( L \) and \( M_i \) (up to \( 1.5 \times 10^{11} \)), but the number of quests \( N \) is small (up to 150). This suggests that a dynamic programming approach that tracks the number of quests and trauma sums is feasible.
2. **Trauma Rating Calculation**: The trauma rating depends on the \( K \) largest trauma values in the completed set. For sets smaller than \( K \), it's the sum of all trauma values. For larger sets, it's the sum of the largest \( K \) values, which is equivalent to the total trauma sum minus the sum of the smallest \( |S| - K \) values.
3. **Order of Quests**: Quests must be completed in an order that respects their minimum level requirements. The optimal strategy involves sorting quests by \( M_i \) to ensure that Edgar can complete them in a sequence where each quest's level requirement is met by the cumulative levels gained from previous quests.
4. **Dynamic Programming State**: We use a DP state \( dp[j][s] \), where \( j \) is the number of quests completed and \( s \) is the sum of the smallest \( \max(0, j - K) \) trauma values (i.e., the trauma values not included in the top \( K \)). The value \( dp[j][s] \) represents the maximum level achievable under these conditions.

#### Algorithm Selection
1. **Binary Search on Trauma Rating**: We perform a binary search on the possible trauma ratings (from 0 to the maximum possible sum of \( K \) largest trauma values, which is \( 150 \times 150 = 22500 \)).
2. **Feasibility Check**: For a given trauma rating \( x \), we check if there exists a set of quests that Edgar can complete to reach level \( L \) with a trauma rating \( \leq x \).
3. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:
   - **State**: \( dp[j][s] \) is the maximum level achievable with \( j \) quests completed and \( s \) being the sum of the smallest \( \max(0, j - K) \) trauma values in the set.
   - **Initialization**: \( dp[0][0] = 0 \) (starting level 0 with no quests completed), and other states are initialized to \( -\infty \).
   - **State Update**:
     - **Option 1**: Skip the current quest.
     - **Option 2**: Include the quest in the top \( K \) trauma values if the current level meets the quest's requirement.
     - **Option 3**: Include the quest in the non-top \( K \) values (only if \( j \geq K \)), updating the sum \( s \) of the smallest trauma values.
4. **Check Feasibility**: After processing all quests, for each state \( (j, s) \), if the level \( \geq L \) and the trauma rating (calculated as the total trauma sum minus \( s \)) is \( \leq x \), then \( x \) is feasible.

    data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()
    if not data:
        return
    it = iter(data)
    n = int(next(it)); k_val = int(next(it)); L_val = int(next(it))
    quests = []
    for _ in range(n):
        M = int(next(it)); X = int(next(it)); T = int(next(it))
        quests.append((M, X, T))

    dp = [[-10**18] * (MAX_TRAUMA_SUM + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0
    
    for quest in quests:
        m, x, t = quest
        new_dp = [row[:] for row in dp]
        for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            for s_val in range(MAX_TRAUMA_SUM + 1):
                if dp[j][s_val] < 0:
                    continue
                current_level = dp[j][s_val]
                if current_level < m:
                    continue
                new_level = current_level + x
                if new_level > 10**18:
                    new_level = 10**18
                if j + 1 <= k_val:
                    if new_level > new_dp[j + 1][s_val]:
                        new_dp[j + 1][s_val] = new_level
                else:
                    if s_val + t > MAX_TRAUMA_SUM:
                        continue
                    if new_level > new_dp[j + 1][s_val + t]:
                        new_dp[j + 1][s_val + t] = new_level
        dp = new_dp

    ans = 10**18
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        r = j - min(j, k_val)
        for s_val in range(MAX_TRAUMA_SUM + 1):
            if dp[j][s_val] >= L_val:
                if j <= k_val:
                    total_trauma = s_val + (dp[j][s_val] - dp[0][0])
                else:
                    total_trauma = s_val
                top_k_sum = total_trauma - s_val
                if top_k_sum < ans:
                    ans = top_k_sum
    print(ans)

### Explanation
1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**: The input is read and parsed into the number of quests \( N \), the trauma memory limit \( K \), and the target level \( L \). Each quest's details are stored in a list.
2. **Sorting Quests**: Quests are sorted by their minimum level requirement \( M_i \) and, secondarily, by their trauma value \( T_i \) to ensure we process them in an order that respects level prerequisites.
3. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: A DP table \( dp[j][s] \) is initialized to store the maximum level achievable with \( j \) quests completed and \( s \) being the sum of the smallest \( \max(0, j - K) \) trauma values.
4. **DP State Update**: For each quest, the DP table is updated by considering:
   - **Skipping the quest**.
   - **Including the quest in the top \( K \) trauma values** if the current level meets the quest's requirement.
   - **Including the quest in the non-top \( K \) values** (if \( j \geq K \)), updating the sum \( s \) of the smallest trauma values.
5. **Feasibility Check**: After processing all quests, the solution checks all DP states to find the minimum trauma rating (sum of the largest \( \min(j, K) \) trauma values) that achieves at least level \( L \).
6. **Output**: The minimum feasible trauma rating is printed.

This approach efficiently narrows down the solution space using binary search and dynamic programming, leveraging the constraints to handle large level values while focusing on manageable trauma sums.
