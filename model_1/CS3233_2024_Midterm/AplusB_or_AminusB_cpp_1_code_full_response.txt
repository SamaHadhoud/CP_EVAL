To solve this problem, we need to count the number of pairs \((A, B)\) such that \(L \le B \le A \le R\) and \((A + B) \mid (A - B) = A + B\), where \(\mid\) denotes the bitwise OR operator. The key insight is recognizing that the condition \((A + B) \mid (A - B) = A + B\) is equivalent to \((A - B) \& (B \ll 1) = 0\), where \(\ll\) denotes a left shift by 1. This means that for any bit set in \(A - B\), the corresponding bit in \(B \ll 1\) must be unset.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires counting valid pairs \((A, B)\) within a range \([L, R]\) where \(B \le A\) and the bitwise condition holds. The condition simplifies to ensuring that \(A - B\) (denoted as \(x\)) has no overlapping set bits with \(B\) shifted left by 1.
2. **Digit Dynamic Programming (Digit DP)**: Given the constraints \(0 \le L \le R \le 2 \times 10^9\), a brute-force approach is infeasible. Instead, we use digit DP to efficiently count valid pairs by processing each bit position from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB).
3. **State Definition**: The DP state is defined as:
   - `bit_index`: Current bit being processed (0 to 31).
   - `carry`: Carry from addition in lower bits (0 or 1).
   - `tight_B_low`: Whether \(B\)'s bits chosen so far match the corresponding prefix of \(L\).
   - `tight_B_high`: Whether \(B\)'s bits chosen so far match the corresponding prefix of \(R\).
   - `tight_A`: Whether \(A\)'s bits chosen so far match the corresponding prefix of \(R\).
   - `prev_B`: The bit of \(B\) at the previous position (to enforce the condition \(x \& (B \ll 1) = 0\)).
4. **Transitions**: For each bit position, iterate over possible bits for \(B\) and \(x\) (where \(x = A - B\)). Update the state based on current bits, ensuring constraints \(L \le B \le R\) and \(B \le A \le R\) are satisfied, and the bitwise condition holds.
5. **Base Case**: When all bits are processed (i.e., `bit_index = 32`), check if the carry is zero to validate the addition.

### Solution Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;

ll L_val, R_val;
ll dp[33][2][2][2][2][2];

ll dfs(int i, int carry, bool tl, bool th, bool ta, int prev) {
    if (i == 32) {
        return (carry == 0) ? 1 : 0;
    }
    if (dp[i][carry][tl][th][ta][prev] != -1) 
        return dp[i][carry][tl][th][ta][prev];
    
    ll res = 0;
    int L_i = (L_val >> i) & 1;
    int R_i = (R_val >> i) & 1;

    int low_B = tl ? L_i : 0;
    int high_B = th ? R_i : 1;

    for (int b = low_B; b <= high_B; b++) {
        for (int x = 0; x < 2; x++) {
            if (i > 0 && x == 1 && prev == 1) 
                continue;

            int total = b + x + carry;
            int bit_A = total & 1;
            int new_carry = total >> 1;

            if (ta) {
                if (bit_A > R_i) 
                    continue;
            }

            bool new_tl = tl && (b == L_i);
            bool new_th = th && (b == R_i);
            bool new_ta = ta && (bit_A == R_i);

            res += dfs(i+1, new_carry, new_tl, new_th, new_ta, b);
        }
    }

    return dp[i][carry][tl][th][ta][prev] = res;
}

int main() {
    cin >> L_val >> R_val;
    memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
    ll ans = dfs(0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0);
    cout << ans << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Digit DP Setup**: The `dfs` function processes each bit position from LSB to MSB (0 to 31). The state tracks carry, tight constraints for \(B\) and \(A\), and the previous bit of \(B\).
2. **Bit Processing**: For each bit position, the function iterates over possible bits for \(B\) (constrained by \(L\) and \(R\)) and \(x\) (constrained by the condition \(x \& (B \ll 1) = 0\)).
3. **State Updates**: The current bits of \(B\) and \(x\) are used to compute the corresponding bit of \(A\) and the new carry. Tight constraints are updated based on whether the current bits match the prefixes of \(L\) and \(R\).
4. **Base Case**: After processing all 32 bits, the function checks if the carry is zero, indicating a valid addition \(B + x = A\).
5. **Memoization**: Results of subproblems are stored in `dp` to avoid redundant computations, ensuring efficiency.
6. **Initialization and Execution**: The `main` function reads input values, initializes the DP table, and starts the DFS from the LSB with initial tight constraints and no carry.

This approach efficiently counts valid pairs by leveraging digit DP to handle large input ranges while enforcing the bitwise condition and constraints.
