We are given N non-overlapping time intervals in chronological order. We are allowed to extend each interval as long as:
1. The entire original interval is covered (so we can only extend the start earlier and/or the end later).
2. The opening time (start of first interval) and closing time (end of last interval) remain unchanged.
3. We wish to maximize the length of the shortest time interval (i.e., we want the smallest interval in the new schedule to be as large as possible).

Note: The intervals must remain non-overlapping. However, note that in the sample output for input #1, the intervals are contiguous and even have a one-minute gap? Actually, the problem says non-overlapping meaning that the end of one is <= the start of the next. But in the sample output, we see:
  20:15 - 21:30
  21:31 - 22:46

So the gap is allowed? Actually, condition (1) only requires that the amended interval includes the original. The original intervals might not be contiguous. However, we are allowed to extend arbitrarily as long as we don't break the non-overlapping condition and the fixed first start and last end.

But note: The original intervals are non-overlapping and in chronological order. We are allowed to extend, but we cannot make them overlap. So we must ensure that the amended intervals remain non-overlapping: meaning the end time of wave i must be <= the start time of wave i+1.

Thus, we have:
  Original interval i: [a_i, b_i] (with a_i, b_i given as strings in HH:MM)
  Amended interval i: [A_i, B_i] such that A_i <= a_i <= b_i <= B_i, and for all i, B_i <= A_{i+1} (so non-overlapping).

And we have fixed: A_1 = a_1 (the first start) and B_N = b_N (the last end) cannot change? Actually, condition 2 says: the opening and closing time remain unchanged. So:
  A_1 must equal the original starting time of the first interval.
  B_N must equal the original ending time of the last interval.

But what about the others? We can change the other boundaries arbitrarily as long as the constraints hold.

Our goal: Maximize the minimum length of the intervals (where the length of interval i is (B_i - A_i) in minutes).

How to approach?

This is a classic "maximize the minimum" problem. We can use binary search on the minimum length L. We want to check: is it possible to assign intervals such that each interval has at least L minutes and the constraints are satisfied?

But note: we are also constrained by the original intervals and the non-overlapping condition.

Steps:

1. Convert all times to total minutes since a fixed time (e.g., 00:00) for easier computation.

2. Let:
   - s_i_orig = original start of interval i (in minutes)
   - e_i_orig = original end of interval i (in minutes)

3. Constraints:
   - A_i <= s_i_orig and B_i >= e_i_orig for each interval i.
   - A_1 = s_1_orig (fixed) and B_N = e_N_orig (fixed).
   - For each i from 1 to N-1: B_i <= A_{i+1] (non-overlapping, meaning contiguous or with gaps? Actually, we can have gaps? The problem does not require contiguous, but non-overlapping. However, condition (1) requires that the amended interval covers the original. So if we leave a gap, that's acceptable. But note: we are allowed to extend arbitrarily as long as we don't break non-overlapping and the covering. However, we are free to set A_i and B_i arbitrarily as long as A_i<=s_i_orig and B_i>=e_i_orig and non-overlapping and fixed endpoints.

4. We wish to maximize min_i (B_i - A_i).

We can use binary search on L (the minimum length). The problem then becomes: for a given L, can we assign [A_i, B_i] for each interval i such that:
   (a) A_i <= s_i_orig, B_i >= e_i_orig.
   (b) A_1 = s_1_orig, B_N = e_N_orig.
   (c) For all i: B_i <= A_{i+1}.
   (d) For all i: B_i - A_i >= L.

How to check for a fixed L?

We can use a greedy algorithm (or dynamic programming) that traverses from left to right and right to left to set the boundaries.

Alternatively, we can set:

  We know A_1 = s_1_orig. Then we can set B_1 to be at least A_1 + L. But we also must have B_1 >= e_1_orig. So we set B_1 = max(e_1_orig, A_1 + L). However, we also have the constraint that B_1 must be <= A_2. Then we set A_2 to be at least ...? But note: we can also extend the next interval backwards arbitrarily? Actually, we have freedom: we can set A_2 as low as we want as long as A_2 <= s_2_orig and A_2 >= B_1 (non-overlapping). However, to satisfy the length L for the second interval, we need B_2 >= A_2 + L and also B_2 >= e_2_orig. And we want to leave as much room as possible for the remaining intervals? 

But note: we have a fixed ending at the last interval. So we want to set the boundaries as "tight" as possible to the left to leave room for the right? Actually, we can do:

  Forward propagation:
    Set A_1 = s_1_orig (fixed).
    Then set B_1 = max(e_1_orig, A_1 + L). 
    Then set A_2 = max(s_2_orig, B_1) ??? -> But wait, we cannot set A_2 arbitrarily? We require A_2 <= s_2_orig? Actually, condition (1) says the amended interval must include the original. So A_2 must be <= s_2_orig. However, we also require non-overlapping: so A_2 must be >= B_1. So we set A_2 = max(B_1, ?) but we cannot exceed s_2_orig. So we set A_2 = max(B_1, ???) and then we set B_2 = max(e_2_orig, A_2 + L). 

But what if we set A_2 = max(B_1, ...)? Actually, we must set A_2 to be at least B_1 and at most s_2_orig. To leave room for the next, we set A_2 as small as possible? Actually, to satisfy the length L for interval 2, we require B_2 >= A_2 + L. And we also require B_2 <= ...? We have to go all the way to the last interval. However, if we set A_2 as small as possible (which is max(B_1, s_2_orig? but wait, we cannot set A_2 below B_1 and above s_2_orig? Actually, we have to set A_2 in [B_1, s_2_orig]? But note: condition (a) requires A_2 <= s_2_orig, and condition (c) requires A_2 >= B_1. So we set A_2 = B_1? But then we set B_2 = max(e_2_orig, A_2+L) = max(e_2_orig, B_1+L). Then for the next interval, we set A_3 = B_2, and so on.

However, what if we set A_2 to a value lower than s_2_orig? Actually, we can set A_2 as low as B_1 (as long as B_1 <= s_2_orig). But if B_1 is greater than s_2_orig, then we have a problem? Then we cannot satisfy both: we need A_2 >= B_1 and A_2 <= s_2_orig, but if B_1 > s_2_orig then no solution? So in the feasibility function, if at any step we have:

  After setting B_i, we require that B_i <= s_{i+1}_orig (so that we can set A_{i+1} in [B_i, s_{i+1}_orig]). Then we set A_{i+1} = B_i (to minimize the start and leave room for the next) and then set B_{i+1} = max(e_{i+1}_orig, A_{i+1}+L).

But what if we set A_{i+1} to a value larger than B_i? That would be allowed? But then we are leaving a gap? However, we are free to set it anywhere between B_i and s_{i+1}_orig. But note: if we set A_{i+1} to a value larger than B_i, then we are not forced to set it to the minimum? Actually, we are trying to make the intervals as left as possible to leave room for the right? Because we have a fixed last end. So we set the intervals as left as possible: meaning we set A_{i+1} = B_i (so no gap) and then set B_{i+1} = max(e_{i+1}_orig, A_{i+1}+L). Then we proceed.

However, at the last interval: we require B_N = e_N_orig (fixed). So we must have:

  After setting B_{N-1}, we set A_N = max(B_{N-1}, s_N_orig) ??? -> But note: condition (a): A_N <= s_N_orig. But we also require A_N >= B_{N-1}. So we set A_N = max(B_{N-1}, s_N_orig) ??? Actually, we cannot set A_N above s_N_orig? We must have A_N <= s_N_orig. So if B_{N-1} > s_N_orig, then we have a problem. Otherwise, we set A_N = B_{N-1} (if we want to minimize the start) and then set B_N = max(e_N_orig, A_N+L). But wait, condition (b) requires B_N = e_N_orig. So we must have:

      B_N = e_N_orig

      and we also require B_N >= A_N + L.

      => A_N <= e_N_orig - L.

But we set A_N = max(B_{N-1}, s_N_orig) and then we require that the computed B_N (if we set it to max(e_N_orig, A_N+L)) must equal e_N_orig? Actually, we are forced to set B_N to e_N_orig. So we must have:

      e_N_orig >= A_N + L   =>   A_N <= e_N_orig - L.

But how do we set A_N? We set A_N = max(B_{N-1}, s_N_orig) and then we require A_N <= e_N_orig - L.

So the feasibility check:

  A[0] = s_0_orig
  B[0] = max(e_0_orig, A[0] + L)

  For i from 1 to N-1:
      A[i] = B[i-1]   # we set the next interval to start at the end of the previous, to leave as much room as possible for the rest?
      But wait: condition (a) says we cannot have A[i] > s_i_orig. So if B[i-1] > s_i_orig, then we fail.

      Then set B[i] = max(e_i_orig, A[i] + L)

  For the last interval i = N-1 (0-indexed) we do the same? Actually, we have to set B[N-1] to e_{N-1}_orig? No, we are forced only at the last interval to have B_N = e_N_orig. But note: the last interval in our array is the last one. So for i = N-1 (the last interval):

      A[N-1] = B[N-2]   (if N>=2) and then we set B[N-1] = max(e_{N-1}_orig, A[N-1] + L) but then we must also set the last interval's end to e_{last}_orig? Actually, condition (b): the last interval's end must be the original last end? 

  But note: the problem says the last interval in the input is the last one. So the last interval is the N-th one. Therefore, we must set:

      For the last interval (index N-1): B[N-1] must be set to the fixed value: e_{N-1}_orig? Actually, the original last interval's end is given and we cannot change that end. So we set:

          A[N-1] = max(B_{N-2], s_{N-1}_orig) ??? -> no, we set A[N-1] = B_{N-2] (if we are doing the greedy) but then we require that the interval [A[N-1], e_{N-1}_orig] must be at least L? So we require:

          e_{N-1}_orig - A[N-1] >= L.

      But also, we require that the interval covers the original [s_{N-1}_orig, e_{N-1}_orig]? So we must have A[N-1] <= s_{N-1}_orig? But we set A[N-1] = B_{N-2] and then we require B_{N-2] <= s_{N-1}_orig. And then we require that the length of the last interval is at least L: e_{N-1}_orig - A[N-1] >= L.

      However, we are not forced to set the end of the last interval to max(e_{N-1}_orig, A[N-1]+L) because we are forced to set the end to the fixed value e_{N-1}_orig. Therefore, we must set:

          B_{N-1] = e_{N-1]_orig   (fixed)

          and then we require: 
             A_{N-1] <= s_{N-1]_orig   (from condition (a))
             and the length: e_{N-1]_orig - A_{N-1] >= L.

          and also A_{N-1] >= B_{N-2] (non-overlapping).

      Therefore, we set A_{N-1] = min(s_{N-1]_orig, e_{N-1]_orig - L) ??? But wait, we also have the constraint from the left: A_{N-1] >= B_{N-2]. So we set:

          A_{N-1] = max(B_{N-2], e_{N-1]_orig - L) ??? and then we require A_{N-1] <= s_{N-1]_orig.

      Actually, we are free to set A_{N-1] anywhere in the range [B_{N-2], s_{N-1]_orig] as long as we have e_{N-1]_orig - A_{N-1] >= L. The condition e_{N-1]_orig - A_{N-1] >= L implies A_{N-1] <= e_{N-1]_orig - L.

      So we require:

          A_{N-1] in [B_{N-2], min(s_{N-1]_orig, e_{N-1]_orig - L)]

      But to satisfy the constraints, we need:

          B_{N-2] <= min(s_{N-1]_orig, e_{N-1]_orig - L)

      Then we set A_{N-1] to the maximum possible? Actually, we want to set it as early as possible to leave room for the last interval? But we have no next interval. However, we have fixed the end. So we set A_{N-1] = B_{N-2] (the minimum we can) to maximize the length (so we get the maximum possible length for the last interval: e_{N-1]_orig - B_{N-2]). Then we require that length is at least L.

But note: we set A_{N-1] = B_{N-2] and then we require:

          e_{N-1]_orig - B_{N-2] >= L   =>   B_{N-2] <= e_{N-1]_orig - L.

      and we also require that B_{N-2] <= s_{N-1]_orig.

So the feasibility check for the entire schedule for a given L:

  Step 1: 
      A0 = s0 (original first start)
      B0 = max(e0, A0+L)   [because we must cover the original end and have length at least L]

  Step 2: for i=1 to N-2 (for the intervals that are not the last and not the first):
      Ai = Bi-1   [we set the start of the next interval to the end of the previous, to minimize the start?]
      But we must have Ai <= s_i (the original start of the i-th interval, because we cannot extend beyond the original interval arbitrarily? Actually, condition (a): the amended interval must cover the original, so Ai (the amended start) must be <= the original start s_i. But if we set Ai = Bi-1 and Bi-1 > s_i, then we fail.

      Then set Bi = max(e_i, Ai+L)

  Step 3: for the last interval (i = N-1):
      We require:
          A_{N-1] = B_{N-2]   (from the greedy propagation) but then we must also have A_{N-1] <= s_{N-1] (original start) and we require that the length of the last interval is at least L: e_{N-1] - A_{N-1] >= L.

      Therefore, we require:
          B_{N-2] <= s_{N-1]   (so that we can set A_{N-1] = B_{N-2] without violating the condition A_{N-1] <= s_{N-1])
          and e_{N-1] - B_{N-2] >= L.

But wait, what if we set the last interval differently? We are forced to set the last interval's end to the fixed value. So we are not free to extend the end? Therefore, the last interval's start can be set arbitrarily as long as:

      A_{N-1] <= s_{N-1]   (to cover the original start) 
      and A_{N-1] >= B_{N-2]   (non-overlapping)
      and A_{N-1] <= e_{N-1] - L   (to have at least L minutes).

      So we can set A_{N-1] anywhere in [B_{N-2], min(s_{N-1], e_{N-1]-L}]. 

      Therefore, we do not necessarily set it to B_{N-2]? We can set it to a value as high as min(s_{N-1], e_{N-1]-L) to make the last interval exactly L? But then the rest of the intervals (to the left) are not affected? Actually, we are free to set it as long as it is at least B_{N-2] and at most min(s_{N-1], e_{N-1]-L). Then we set B_{N-1] = e_{N-1] (fixed).

      However, note: the greedy propagation we did for the forward pass assumed that we set each interval as left as possible. But if we set the last interval not at B_{N-2] but higher, then we are leaving a gap? And that gap doesn't break any condition. But then the interval for the second last is fixed (we set B_{N-2] in the forward pass) and we don't need to change it? 

      Actually, in the forward pass we set the intervals as left as possible to minimize the consumption of the timeline. Then we check the last interval: if we can set A_{N-1] = B_{N-2] and have the last interval length at least L, then that's the minimal consumption. But if we set the last interval to start later, then the constraint on the last interval is easier? Actually, we want to check: is there an assignment for the last interval? So we don't necessarily have to set it to B_{N-2]. We can set it to any value in that range. Therefore, we only require that the range [B_{N-2], min(s_{N-1], e_{N-1]-L)] is non-empty.

      So the condition for the last interval is: 
          B_{N-2] <= min(s_{N-1], e_{N-1]-L)

      which is equivalent to:
          B_{N-2] <= s_{N-1]   and   B_{N-2] <= e_{N-1]-L

      But note: we also require that the last interval covers the original: so we must have A_{N-1] <= s_{N-1] and we are setting A_{N-1] in [B_{N-2], ...] so the condition B_{N-2] <= s_{N-1] is necessary to have any solution? Actually, if B_{N-2] > s_{N-1], then we cannot set A_{N-1] <= s_{N-1] and also >= B_{N-2]. So that condition is necessary.

      And the condition for the length: we require A_{N-1] <= e_{N-1]-L. Since we can choose A_{N-1] as low as B_{N-2] (and we want to see if there is at least one value), we require that the lower bound B_{N-2] is at most e_{N-1]-L.

      Therefore, the feasibility condition for the last interval is:
          B_{N-2] <= min(s_{N-1], e_{N-1]-L)

      But note: we are not actually setting A_{N-1] to B_{N-2] in the feasibility check? We are just checking that we can set it to a value that satisfies the constraints. The minimal constraint is that the set [B_{N-2], min(s_{N-1], e_{N-1]-L)] is non-empty. So we require:

          B_{N-2] <= min(s_{N-1], e_{N-1]-L)

      Then we can set A_{N-1] to B_{N-2] (which is the minimal start) and then the last interval will have length = e_{N-1] - B_{N-2] which is at least L? Actually, we require B_{N-2] <= e_{N-1]-L, so e_{N-1] - B_{N-2] >= L.

      Therefore, we can do the forward propagation for the first N-1 intervals (index 0 to N-2) and then check the last interval.

However, what about the last interval if N=1? Then we have only one interval. Then we set A0 = s0 (fixed) and we require B0 = e0 (fixed) and then we require e0 - s0 >= L? So L must be at most (e0-s0). But note N>=2.

But wait: the problem says N>=2.

So the feasibility check for L:

  A[0] = s0
  B[0] = max(e0, A[0] + L)

  For i=1 to N-2:
      A[i] = B[i-1]
      If A[i] > s_i: return False   (because we require A[i] <= s_i, but we set it to B[i-1] which is >= ...)
      Then B[i] = max(e_i, A[i] + L)

  Then for the last interval (i=N-1, 0-indexed last is index N-1):
      We require:
          B[N-2] <= s_{N-1]   and   B[N-2] <= e_{N-1] - L

      Then we set A[N-1] = B[N-2] (or any value in the range, but for the feasibility we only need to check the constraints) and then we set B[N-1] = e_{N-1] (fixed). The last interval length is e_{N-1] - B[N-2] which is at least L by the second condition.

But note: what if we can set the last interval to start at a value greater than B_{N-2]? Then we would have more flexibility? Actually, we are trying to minimize the constraints for the last interval? The condition we derived is necessary and sufficient: we can set the last interval if and only if B_{N-2] <= min(s_{N-1], e_{N-1]-L). 

However, there is an alternative: we can also do a backward propagation? Why not? Because the problem has fixed endpoints. So we can also do:

  We know the last interval must end at e_{last]. Then we can set A_{last] = e_{last] - L? But wait, we require the last interval must be at least L, so we set A_{last] to at most e_{last] - L. But we also have to cover the original: so we require A_{last] <= s_{last]. And we require that the start of the last interval must be at least the end of the previous interval: A_{last] >= B_{N-2]. 

  Actually, the forward propagation we did is greedy: we set the intervals as left as possible. But if we set the intervals as left as possible, we are using the minimal timeline. Then we check the last constraint. However, if we set the intervals more to the right, we might leave more room for the last interval? But note: we have fixed the start of the first and the end of the last. So the entire timeline is fixed? Actually, the total time is fixed: from s0 to e_{last]. The greedy forward propagation uses the minimal timeline: meaning the entire timeline from s0 to B_{N-2] is used. Then the last interval must start at B_{N-2] and end at e_{last]. Therefore, the constraint we derived is necessary.

  But what if we do not set the intermediate intervals as left as possible? For example, we could set an intermediate interval to start later? Then we would leave more room for the last interval? Actually, if we set an intermediate interval to start later, then we set its start later, then its end might be later, and then the next interval starts later, and so the last interval might start later? But then we have to cover the same total timeline? Actually, the total timeline is fixed: from s0 to e_{last]. 

  Therefore, we can also do a backward pass? 

  Alternatively, we can do:

      We set the last interval: 
          B_{N-1] = e_{last] (fixed)
          A_{N-1] = min(s_{last], e_{last] - L)   [because we want the last interval to be at least L, and we cannot exceed the original start? Actually, we can set A_{N-1] as low as we want? No, condition (a) requires that the amended interval covers the original, so we must have A_{N-1] <= s_{last] and B_{N-1] = e_{last] >= e_{last] (so that part is satisfied). But we are free to set A_{N-1] to any value <= s_{last] as long as the length is at least L and also A_{N-1] >= the end of the previous interval? 

      Actually, we can set A_{N-1] to any value in [max(?, the end of the previous interval), min(s_{last], e_{last]-L)]. 

      To maximize the room for the previous intervals, we set the last interval as right as possible? Actually, we set A_{N-1] as high as possible? Then we set:

          A_{N-1] = min(s_{last], e_{last]-L)

      Then the previous interval must end by A_{N-1]. 

      Then we do a backward propagation? 

      But note: we have fixed the first interval's start. So we can do a backward propagation for the first N-1 intervals:

          For the last but one (i = N-2) in backward order:
             B_{N-2] = A_{N-1]   (because non-overlapping: the end of the (N-2)-th interval must be <= the start of the last)
             Then we set A_{N-2] = max(s_{N-2], B_{N-2] - (the length we require?))? Actually, we require the length of the (N-2)-th interval to be at least L: so we set:

                 A_{N-2] = min(s_{N-2], B_{N-2] - L)   [to minimize the start? But we also have to cover the original: so we require A_{N-2] <= s_{N-2] and we require the interval to be at least L: B_{N-2] - A_{N-2] >= L => A_{N-2] <= B_{N-2] - L. 

          Then for the next backward step: set B_{N-3] = A_{N-2] and then set A_{N-3] = min(s_{N-3], B_{N-3] - L), and so on.

      Then at the first interval: we set A0 = min(s0, B0 - L) and then we require A0 = s0 (fixed). So we require that min(s0, B0 - L) = s0, meaning s0 <= B0 - L? 

          => B0 >= s0 + L.

          and we also require that the interval covers the original: so we set B0 = max(e0, A0 + L) = max(e0, s0+L) [since A0=s0]. Then we require that the backward pass sets B0 to the value we set in the backward propagation? Actually, we set:

          In the backward propagation for the first interval: 
              We set B0 = A1 (from the next interval) 
              Then we set A0 = min(s0, B0 - L) = min(s0, A1 - L)

          But we require A0 = s0, so we must have s0 <= A1 - L? and then we set A0 = s0.

          Then we require that the forward setting for the first interval: we set B0 = max(e0, s0+L). Then we require that B0 (from the backward propagation) = A1 = max(e0, s0+L). Then we also require that in the backward propagation we set A0 = min(s0, A1 - L) = s0, which forces s0 <= A1 - L, i.e., A1 >= s0 + L. But we set A1 = B0 = max(e0, s0+L) which is at least s0+L. So that condition is satisfied.

      However, we also have to check that the interval covers the original: we set A0 = s0 (which is the original start) and we set B0 = max(e0, s0+L). This is the same as the forward propagation.

      But then we have to check the intermediate intervals: in the backward propagation, we set:

          For i from N-2 down to 1 (0-indexed, meaning the second last to the second):
             B_i = A_{i+1]   (from the next interval in the backward propagation: which is the interval we set from the next step)
             Then set A_i = min(s_i, B_i - L)

          Then we require that the interval covers the original: so we must have A_i <= s_i (satisfied by the min) and B_i >= e_i? But we set B_i = A_{i+1] and we set A_i = min(s_i, A_{i+1] - L). Then we require that B_i >= e_i? So we require A_{i+1] >= e_i.

          But note: in the forward propagation we set B_i = max(e_i, A_i+L). In the backward propagation we set A_i = min(s_i, A_{i+1]-L). Then we require that the interval [A_i, B_i] = [A_i, A_{i+1]] has length = A_{i+1] - A_i >= L? 

          We set A_i = min(s_i, A_{i+1]-L). Then:

             If we set A_i = A_{i+1]-L, then the length is L -> satisfies.
             If we set A_i = s_i, then we require that the length A_{i+1] - s_i >= L -> A_{i+1] >= s_i+L. 

          But we also require that the interval covers the original: so we require A_i <= s_i and A_{i+1] >= e_i? 

      How to reconcile? We have two constraints: the interval must cover [s_i, e_i] and be at least L. So we require:

          A_i <= s_i
          B_i = A_{i+1] >= e_i
          and the length = A_{i+1] - A_i >= L.

      In the backward propagation, we set A_i = min(s_i, A_{i+1]-L). Then:

          If A_{i+1]-L <= s_i, then we set A_i = A_{i+1]-L. Then the interval is [A_{i+1]-L, A_{i+1]] -> length L. And we require that it covers [s_i, e_i]: 
             We need A_i <= s_i -> but we set A_i = A_{i+1]-L, and we have A_{i+1]-L <= s_i -> so A_i <= s_i. 
             We need A_{i+1] >= e_i -> that's a constraint we must check? Actually, we set B_i = A_{i+1] and we require B_i>=e_i. So we require A_{i+1] >= e_i.

          If A_{i+1]-L > s_i, then we set A_i = s_i. Then the interval is [s_i, A_{i+1]]. Then we require:
             A_{i+1] - s_i >= L -> which is true by the condition that A_{i+1]-L > s_i -> A_{i+1] > s_i+L -> so the length is > L? Actually, we require at least L -> then it's satisfied? 
             and we require A_{i+1] >= e_i.

      Therefore, the backward propagation for the intermediate interval i (not first and not last) requires:

          A_{i+1] >= max(e_i, s_i+L)   ??? Actually, if we set A_i = s_i, then we require A_{i+1] >= s_i+L. And we also require A_{i+1] >= e_i. So overall: A_{i+1] >= max(e_i, s_i+L). 

      But note: in the backward propagation we are setting the intervals from right to left. We start from the last interval and go backwards. 

      Algorithm for feasibility check for L (with backward propagation? or two passes?):

          We know the last interval: 
             A_last = min(s_last, e_last - L)   [to maximize the start? Actually, we want to set the last interval as high as possible to leave room for the left?]
             Then we set the end of the previous interval to A_last.

          Then for i from N-2 down to 1:
             B_i = A_{i+1]   (the next interval's start)
             Then set A_i = min(s_i, B_i - L)   [to set the start as high as possible?]

             Then we require that B_i >= e_i? Actually, we require that the interval [A_i, B_i] covers the original [s_i, e_i]. So we require:
                 A_i <= s_i (satisfied by the min) 
                 B_i >= e_i   -> which is A_{i+1] >= e_i

          Then for the first interval:
             B0 = A1
             Then set A0 = min(s0, B0 - L)   but we require A0 = s0 (fixed). So we require that min(s0, B0-L) = s0, which implies s0 <= B0-L -> B0>=s0+L.

          And we also require that the first interval covers the original: so we require B0 >= e0? 

          Then we set the first interval: [A0, B0] = [s0, A1]. Then we require:
             A1 >= max(e0, s0+L)   [because we require B0>=e0 and B0>=s0+L]

      But note: in the backward propagation, we set A1 = min(s1, A2 - L). Then we require A1 >= max(e0, s0+L). 

      How do we know if that holds? We do the backward propagation and then check the first interval? 

      Alternatively, we can do a forward propagation and then a backward propagation and then check for consistency? 

  Actually, we can do:

      Step 1: set the last interval: 
          A[N-1] = min(s_{last], e_{last]-L)
          B[N-1] = e_{last]

      Step 2: for i from N-2 down to 0:
          B[i] = A[i+1]
          A[i] = min(s_i, B[i] - L)

      Step 3: Check the first interval: 
          We require A[0] = s0? 
          But we set A[0] = min(s0, B[0]-L). Then we require min(s0, B[0]-L) = s0. This requires s0 <= B[0]-L, i.e., B[0] >= s0+L.

          And we also require that the first interval covers the original: so we require B[0] >= e0.

          Therefore, we require B[0] >= max(e0, s0+L).

      Then we also have to check for each interval i (from 0 to N-1) that the interval covers the original? 
          For i: we require A[i] <= s_i (satisfied by the min) and B[i] >= e_i? 

      So the feasibility check for L: 
          We do the backward propagation as above, and then we check for each i that B[i] >= e_i? 

      However, note: we set A[i] = min(s_i, B[i]-L) and then we set B[i] = A[i+1] for i from N-2 down to 0. Then we have:

          For i: 
             Condition 1: A[i] <= s_i -> satisfied.
             Condition 2: B[i] = A[i+1] and we require B[i] >= e_i? -> we must check.

      Therefore, we need to check for each i (except the last) that B[i] = A[i+1] >= e_i.

      And for the last interval: we set B[N-1]=e_{last] (fixed) and we require that the last interval covers the original? 
          We have A[N-1] = min(s_{last], e_{last]-L) -> so A[N-1] <= s_{last] (satisfied) and B[N-1]=e_{last] (so covers the original end) -> satisfied.

      Then the feasibility condition for L is:

          (i) For i=0 to N-2: A[i+1] >= e_i?   [because B[i]=A[i+1] and we require B[i]>=e_i]
          (ii) For the first interval: we require A0 = min(s0, A1 - L) = s0, which implies A1 >= s0+L and also we require A1>=e0? Actually, we require A1>=max(e0, s0+L) for the first interval? 

          But note: condition (i) for i=0: we require A1 (which is the start of the second interval) >= e0. And condition (ii) for the first interval: we require A1>=s0+L. So overall: A1>=max(e0, s0+L).

          Then for the other intervals: for i>=1: we require A[i+1] >= e_i.

          And we also require that the backward propagation does not break? Actually, we do the backward propagation and then check these conditions.

      How to compute the A[i] and B[i] in the backward propagation? We start from the last interval and go backwards.

      Algorithm for feasibility for L (using backward propagation):

          Let A[N-1] = min(s_last, e_last - L)   [but note: we cannot set A[N-1] below the original start? Actually, condition (a) only requires A[N-1] <= s_last, but we are free to set it as low as we want? However, we are setting it to min(s_last, e_last-L) to maximize the start?]

          Then for i = N-2, N-3, ..., 0:
              B[i] = A[i+1]
              A[i] = min(s_i, B[i] - L)

          Then, check:
             (1) For the first interval: A[0] == s0? Actually, we require A[0] = s0? Condition (a) for the first interval: we must have A[0] <= s0? But condition (2): the opening time remains unchanged -> so A[0] must equal the original start? That is fixed. So we require A[0] = s0. But we set A[0] = min(s0, B[0]-L). Then we require that this min equals s0, which requires s0 <= B[0]-L -> B[0] >= s0+L.

             (2) For every interval i (0<=i<=N-1): we require that the interval [A[i], B[i]] covers the original interval [s_i, e_i]. Since we have A[i] <= s_i (by the min) and we require B[i] >= e_i. 

          Therefore, we need to check for every interval i: 
               B[i] >= e_i.

          Note: for the last interval, B[N-1]=e_last, so it covers the original end. And we set A[N-1] = min(s_last, e_last-L) so A[N-1] <= s_last -> covers the original start.

      However, what about the non-overlapping? We set B[i] = A[i+1] for every i from 0 to N-2, so the intervals are contiguous? Actually, the end of one is the start of the next. So they are contiguous and non-overlapping.

      Therefore, the feasibility check for L:

          Step 1: Convert the original intervals to minutes: s_i, e_i for i=0..N-1.

          Step 2: 
             Let A[N-1] = min(s[N-1], e[N-1]-L)   [because we want to set the last interval's start as high as possible to leave room for the previous intervals, but also we cannot set it above s_{N-1] and we require the length at least L: so we set it to min(s_{N-1], e_{N-1]-L).]

          Step 3: 
             For i from N-2 down to 0:
                 B[i] = A[i+1]
                 A[i] = min(s[i], B[i] - L)

          Step 4: 
             Check:
                 (a) A[0] == s[0]? Actually, we require the first interval's start to be unchanged? Condition (2): the opening time remains unchanged -> so we require A[0] = s[0]. But we set A[0]=min(s[0], B[0]-L). So if min(s[0], B[0]-L) != s[0], then it fails. This happens if s[0] > B[0]-L -> then we set A[0]=B[0]-L which is less than s[0] -> then we fail? Actually, we require A[0]=s[0]. So we must have:

                     min(s[0], B[0]-L) = s[0]   =>   s[0] <= B[0]-L   =>   B[0] >= s[0]+L.

                 (b) For every i from 0 to N-1: 
                         B[i] >= e[i]   [to cover the original end]

          If both (a) and (b) hold, then L is feasible.

      But note: condition (a) is actually a special case of (b) for the first interval? No, because (a) is about the start being fixed and (b) is about the end covering.

      Actually, condition (a) is independent: the start of the first interval must be s0. And we set A[0]=min(s0, B[0]-L). Then we require that equals s0, so we require s0 <= B[0]-L.

      Condition (b) for the first interval: we require B[0]>=e0. So overall for the first interval: B[0] >= max(e0, s0+L).

      Then we can simply check for every interval i: B[i]>=e_i, and also for the first interval we have the extra constraint that we set A[0]=s0? Actually, we set A[0]=min(s0, B[0]-L) and then we check if that equals s0. And we also check B[0]>=e0.

      But note: if we set A[0]=min(s0, B[0]-L) and we have B[0]>=e0 and also B[0]>=s0+L, then min(s0, B[0]-L)=s0? because s0<=B[0]-L? -> then min(s0, B[0]-L)=s0. So if we ensure (b) for the first interval (B[0]>=e0) and the condition B[0]>=s0+L, then (a) is satisfied.

      Therefore, the feasibility check can be:

          Step 1: Set A[N-1] = min(s[N-1], e[N-1]-L)
          Step 2: For i=N-2 down to 0: 
                  B[i] = A[i+1]
                  A[i] = min(s[i], B[i]-L)

          Step 3: Check:
                  (a) For every i from 0 to N-1: B[i] >= e[i]
                  (b) For the first interval: we also require that the setting for A[0] is s0? Actually, from the min we set A[0]=min(s0, B[0]-L). Then if we have B[0]>=s0+L, then A[0] will be s0? But we set A[0]=min(s0, B[0]-L). If B[0]>=s0+L, then B[0]-L>=s0, so min(s0, B[0]-L)=s0. So condition (a) for the first interval (B[0]>=e0) and the condition for the start (A[0]=s0) is satisfied as long as B[0]>=max(e0, s0+L). 

          But note: condition (a) in step 3 already requires B[0]>=e0. However, we also require B[0]>=s0+L? This is not explicitly in condition (a). Therefore, we must check:

                  For the first interval: B[0] >= max(e0, s0+L)

          But condition (a) only requires B[0]>=e0. So we must additionally check for the first interval: B[0]>=s0+L? 

          Alternatively, we can note: if B[0]>=s0+L, then the min operation sets A[0]=s0. And condition (a) requires B[0]>=e0. Then the first interval is [s0, B[0]] which covers [s0, e0] because B[0]>=e0, and the length is B[0]-s0>=L.

          Therefore, we require for the first interval: B[0]>=max(e0, s0+L).

      However, we did not impose this condition in the backward propagation? We set A[0]=min(s0, B[0]-L). Then if B[0]>=s0+L, we get A[0]=s0. If not, we get A[0]=B[0]-L, and then we check condition (a): we require B[0]>=e0. But we do not require anything about the length? Actually, the length of the first interval is B[0]-A[0]. If we set A[0]=B[0]-L, then the length is L. But we also require that the interval covers the original: so we require A[0]<=s0 and B[0]>=e0. 

          A[0] = B[0]-L <= s0? 
          => B[0] - L <= s0  => B[0] <= s0+L.

          But then we are in the case that B[0] < s0+L? Then we set A[0]=B[0]-L. Then the length is L. And we require:
             A[0] = B[0]-L <= s0   (which we have) and B[0]>=e0 (from condition (a)). 

          Then the interval is [B[0]-L, B[0]]. We require that it covers [s0, e0]: 
             We have A[0] = B[0]-L <= s0, so the start is covered? Actually, we require that the entire original interval [s0, e0] is within [A[0], B[0]]. 

          Conditions: 
             s0 must be >= A[0]? -> yes, because we set A[0] = B[0]-L <= s0? Actually, we set A[0]=min(s0, B[0]-L). In this case we set A[0]=B[0]-L, and we are in the case B[0]-L <= s0. Then the interval starts at B[0]-L and ends at B[0]. Then the original interval [s0, e0] must be contained in [B[0]-L, B[0]]. 

          How? 
             We require s0 >= B[0]-L? -> but we have B[0]-L <= s0, so s0 might be greater than B[0]-L. But we also require e0<=B[0] (which we have from condition (a)) and s0 is at least B[0]-L? Actually, we require the entire [s0, e0] to be inside [B[0]-L, B[0]]. 

          Conditions:
             (i) A[0] = B[0]-L <= s0 -> satisfied by our setting (because we set A[0]=B[0]-L only if B[0]-L<=s0).
             (ii) B[0] >= e0 -> satisfied by condition (a).

          Then we also require that the interval [B[0]-L, B[0]] covers [s0, e0]. 
             To cover s0: we require A[0] <= s0 -> satisfied.
             To cover e0: we require B[0] >= e0 -> satisfied.

          But what about s0? We have A[0] = B[0]-L <= s0, but we also require that s0 is in the interval? That is, we require s0 <= B[0]? This is true because s0 <= e0 (since the original interval is valid) and e0<=B[0]? Actually, no: we only have s0<=e0 and e0<=B[0], so s0<=B[0]. 

          However, we do not require s0>=A[0]? We have A[0]<=s0, so s0 is at least A[0]. Then the entire original interval [s0, e0] is contained in [A[0], B[0]]? 

          But note: we have A[0] <= s0 <= e0 <= B[0] -> so yes.

          Therefore, the first interval is valid even if we set A[0]=B[0]-L (which is less than s0) as long as B[0]>=e0 and B[0]-L<=s0. 

          But condition (2): the opening time remains unchanged? We set A[0]=B[0]-L, which is not the original s0? That violates condition (2). 

      Condition (2) says: "the opening and closing time of the restaurant remains unchanged. That is, you cannot change the starting time of the first interval or the ending time of the last interval."

      Therefore, we must have A[0]=s0 (the original start) and B[N-1]=e_{last] (the original last end). 

      So the first interval's start cannot be changed: we must have A[0]=s0. 

      Therefore, in the backward propagation we require that the min operation for the first interval yields s0. That requires:

          min(s0, B[0]-L) = s0   =>   s0 <= B[0]-L   =>   B[0] >= s0+L.

      And we also require B[0]>=e0.

      So overall: B[0] >= max(s0+L, e0).

      Then the feasibility check for L is:

          Step 1: Set A[N-1] = min(s[N-1], e[N-1]-L)
          Step 2: For i=N-2 down to 0:
                  B[i] = A[i+1]
                  A[i] = min(s[i], B[i]-L)

          Step 3: Check for every i from 0 to N-1: 
                  B[i] >= e[i]   (to cover the original end)

          Step 4: Check for the first interval: A[0] must be s0? Actually, we set A[0] by the min, so we require that the min is s0. But we can check: if A[0] != s0, then fail. But note: we set A[0]=min(s0, B[0]-L). Then if A[0] != s0, it means we set A[0]=B[0]-L and then we have B[0]-L < s0. But then we also require B[0]>=e0 and the covering is satisfied? But the start is changed: we are not allowed to change the start of the first interval. So we must have A[0]==s0.

          Alternatively, we can require B[0]>=s0+L. Then A[0] will be s0. And then we also require B[0]>=e0.

      Therefore, we can check:

          (a) A[0] == s0
          (b) For every i: B[i] >= e[i]

      But note: if (a) holds, then we have B[0]>=s0+L (because if B[0] were < s0+L, then we would have set A[0]=B[0]-L, which is not s0). So (a) implies B[0]>=s0+L. And then (b) for i=0 requires B[0]>=e0, so we have B[0]>=max(s0+L, e0).

      Therefore, we can do:

          Run the backward propagation.

          Then:
             if A[0] != s0: return False
             for i in range(N):
                 if B[i] < e[i]: return False

          Then return True.

      But note: the last interval's end is fixed to e_last, so B[N-1]=e_last, so it satisfies B[N-1]>=e_last. And for i=N-1, we also have the covering of the start by setting A[N-1] = min(s_last, e_last-L)<=s_last.

      Therefore, the feasibility check for L is:

          // Convert all times to minutes: s[0..N-1], e[0..N-1]
          A = [0] * N
          B = [0] * N

          // Last interval
          B[N-1] = e[N-1]   // fixed
          A[N-1] = min(s[N-1], e[N-1]-L)

          // Propagate backwards
          for i from N-2 down to 0:
              B[i] = A[i+1]
              A[i] = min(s[i], B[i]-L)

          // Check first interval's start
          if A[0] != s[0]:
              return False

          // Check covering of the original end for every interval
          for i from 0 to N-1:
              if B[i] < e[i]:
                  return False

          return True

  But note: it is possible that during the backward propagation, we get an interval with negative length? For example, if B[i]-L is negative, then min(s[i], B[i]-L) would be negative? But the times are between 16:00 and 23:59, so in minutes: 16*60=960 to 23*60+59 = 1439 minutes. And L is at most the entire day? But we will binary search L from 0 to (last_end - first_start) (which is at most 1439-960=479 minutes). So B[i]-L might be negative? 

  However, we start from the last interval: e_last is at least 16:00 (but the last interval is at least 16:00). Then we go backwards: we subtract L each time? And we do this for N-1 steps? So the total subtraction is at most (N-1)*L. Since N<=200, and L<=479, then total subtraction is 200*479=95800 minutes, which is more than 24 hours. So we might get negative. 

  But note: the entire timeline is fixed: from s0 to e_last. The total length is at most 479 minutes. And we are only allowed to extend the intervals within the same day. So the backward propagation must yield a start for the first interval that is at least s0? But wait: we are setting the first interval's start to s0. And we are not allowed to extend the first interval's start earlier? Actually, condition (1) says we are allowed to extend the start earlier? But condition (2) says the opening time (start of the first) remains unchanged -> so we cannot extend it earlier. 

  Therefore, the first interval's start is fixed at s0. In the backward propagation, we might set an intermediate start to a value less than s0? But then we would have to cover the original interval which is at least s0? That would be impossible. 

  However, the feasibility check by backward propagation might yield an intermediate A[i] that is below s0? But then the covering condition for that interval: we require B[i]>=e[i] and A[i]<=s[i] (which is satisfied) but also the original interval [s[i], e[i]] must be contained in [A[i], B[i]]. Since A[i] might be below s0, but the entire timeline is from s0 to e_last, and the original intervals are given in chronological order and non-overlapping, and they start at s0 or later. Therefore, if we set A[i] < s0, that's allowed? 

  But condition (1): the amended interval must be inclusive of the original. The original interval is [s[i], e[i]], which is within [s0, e_last]. And the amended interval [A[i], B[i]] must cover [s[i], e[i]]. 

  However, if we set A[i] < s0, then the amended interval starts before the restaurant opens? That's not allowed. 

  Therefore, we also require that the entire amended interval is within the restaurant hours? 

  But the problem says: "the time intervals are all within the same day, between 16:00 and 23:59". And we are not allowed to change the opening and closing time. So the amended intervals must be within [s0, e_last]? 

  Actually, the first interval starts at s0 and the last ends at e_last, and they are non-overlapping and in order. So the entire amended schedule is within [s0, e_last]. 

  Therefore, we must have for every interval i: 
        s0 <= A[i] <= B[i] <= e_last.

  And in the backward propagation, we start from the last interval: A[N-1] = min(s_last, e_last-L) >= e_last - (e_last-s0) = s0? -> L can be at most e_last - s0. 

  But note: we are binary searching L from 0 to (e_last - s0). 

  And in the backward propagation: 
        A[i] = min(s_i, B[i]-L) 
        and B[i] = A[i+1] <= e_last.

        so B[i]-L >= s0 - L? But L is at most e_last-s0, so s0-L could be negative? 

  However, we also have the constraint that the entire amended schedule is within [s0, e_last]. So we require A[i] >= s0 for every i? 

  But note: the first interval: A[0]=s0. For the next interval: A[1] = B[0] = A[1] (from the next) ... wait, no: we set B[0]=A[1] and A[0]=min(s0, B[0]-L) = s0. Then A[1] = B[0] = A[1] ... we haven't defined yet. 

  Actually, we do the backward propagation from last to first. For the last interval: A[N-1] = min(s_last, e_last-L) >= s0? We hope so? 

  We can add a check in the propagation: if B[i]-L < s0, then we set A[i] = min(s_i, B[i]-L) might be < s0. Then the interval would start before s0? That's not allowed.

  Therefore, we must also ensure that for every interval i: 
        A[i] >= s0.

  But how? We set A[i] = min(s_i, B[i]-L). We require that this value is at least s0. So we require:

        min(s_i, B[i]-L) >= s0   =>   B[i]-L >= s0   [if we choose B[i]-L] and s_i>=s0 (which is true because the original starts are at least s0).

  So we require B[i] >= s0+L.

  But then in the backward propagation, we start from the last: 
        B[N-1]=e_last, then A[N-1]=min(s_last, e_last-L). Then for i=N-2: 
             B[N-2]=A[N-1] = min(s_last, e_last-L)
             Then we require B[N-2] >= s0+L? 

  This might fail if min(s_last, e_last-L) < s0+L.

  Therefore, we must also check in the backward propagation that for every i, we have B[i] >= s0+L? 

  Alternatively, we can check at each step that the interval we are forming is valid. 

  Given the complexity, we might stick to the following feasibility check for L:

      We require that the entire timeline has at least L in each interval and we have fixed endpoints.

      Total time available: T = e_last - s0.
      We are going to assign N intervals, each at least L. So we require N * L <= T + ??? 

      But also we have to cover the gaps between the original intervals? Actually, the amended intervals must cover the original intervals and be within [s0, e_last]. 

  However, we have a more straightforward method: the greedy backward propagation that sets the intervals as much to the right as possible, and then we check the constraints.

  Algorithm for feasibility(L):

      s0_minutes = convert(s0)
      e_last_minutes = convert(e_last)

      A = [0]*N   # in minutes
      B = [0]*N

      # Last interval
      B[N-1] = e_last_minutes
      A[N-1] = min(s_last_minutes, e_last_minutes - L)   # s_last_minutes is the original start of the last interval

      # We require A[N-1] >= s0_minutes? -> not necessarily, but we will check later.

      for i in range(N-2, -1, -1):
          B[i] = A[i+1]
          # If B[i] - L < s0_minutes, then we set A[i] = min(s_i_minutes, B[i]-L) which might be below s0_minutes? -> then invalid.
          A[i] = min(s_i_minutes, B[i] - L)

      # Now check:
      # 1. The first interval's start must be s0_minutes.
      if A[0] != s0_minutes:
          return False

      # 2. Each interval must cover the original end: B[i] >= e_i_minutes.
      for i in range(N):
          if B[i] < e_i_minutes:
              return False

      # 3. Each interval must be within [s0_minutes, e_last_minutes] and non-negative? 
      #    But the covering of the original end and the propagation should ensure they are in the timeline.
      #    Specifically, we require A[i] >= s0_minutes? 
      #    For the first: A[0]=s0_minutes.
      #    For the others: 
      #        A[i] = min(s_i_minutes, B[i]-L) 
      #        and B[i] = A[i+1] 
      #        and A[i+1] is at least s0_minutes (by induction) then B[i]-L = A[i+1]-L, which might be below s0_minutes? 
      #    So we must check explicitly that A[i] >= s0_minutes for all i.
      for i in range(N):
          if A[i] < s0_minutes or B[i] > e_last_minutes:
              return False

      return True

  However, condition (3) might be redundant because the first is s0 and the last is e_last, and the intervals are contiguous (B[i]=A[i+1]) and in order, so if the first start is s0 and the last end is e_last and contiguous, then the entire schedule is in [s0, e_last]. 

  But note: we set A[0]=s0, and then B[0]=A[1], and A[1] = min(s1, B[0]-L) = min(s1, A[1]-L) ??? -> wait, let me see for i=0: 
        B[0] = A[1]
        A[0] = min(s0, B[0]-L) = min(s0, A[1]-L) = s0   [because we already require and assume we passed the first condition]

  Then for i=1: 
        B[1] = A[2]
        A[1] = min(s1, B[1]-L) = min(s1, A[2]-L)

  This doesn't ensure A[1]>=s0? We have A[1] = min(s1, A[2]-L). Since s1>=s0 and A[2] might be >=s0? We don't know.

  Example: 
      N=2, 
      Original: 
          interval0: [s0, e0] = [0, 10]   (in minutes, but we require s0=0, e0=10)
          interval1: [s1, e1] = [100, 200] and e_last=200.
      L=50.

      Backward propagation:
          A[1] = min(s1, e1-50) = min(100, 150) = 100.
          B[0] = A[1] = 100.
          A[0] = min(s0, B[0]-50) = min(0,50)=0. -> then A[0]=0=s0, so condition 1 holds.
      Check covering: 
          B[0]=100>=e0=10 -> holds.
          B[1]=200>=e1=200 -> holds.
      But the first interval is [0,100] and the second [100,200]. 
      However, the restaurant opening hours are [0,200] -> so it's valid.

  But if we try L=150:
      Last interval: A[1]=min(100, 200-150)=min(100,50)=50.
      Then B[0]=A[1]=50.
      A[0]=min(0, 50-150)=min(0, -100)= -100 -> then we require A[0]==0 -> fails.

  But note: we have an additional check: at propagation, we get A[0]=-100, which is <0, and then we check A[0]==0 -> fails.

  So the feasibility check is as above.

  Then we can do a binary search on L:

      L_low = 0
      L_high = (e_last - s0)   // the maximum possible L cannot exceed the total time divided by 1 (but note we have N intervals)

      However, we have to have at least L for each of N intervals, and they are non-overlapping, so the maximum L is at most (e_last-s0)/N? But not exactly, because they can be extended arbitrarily as long as they cover the orignal and non-overlapping. 

      Actually, we can try L from 0 up to (e_last-s0) (the entire length), but note: one interval might be the entire length and the others are 0? But we require each at least L. So the maximum L is at most (e_last-s0)/N.

      However, the sample input2: 
          2
          19:01 - 19:02
          19:03 - 19:04
          Total time from 19:01 to 19:04 is 3 minutes. Then we have 2 intervals, so L is at most 1.5 minutes? But the sample output has the first interval 2 minutes? 

      Let me compute the sample input2:

          s0 = 19:01 -> 19*60+1 = 1141 minutes.
          e0 = 19:02 -> 1142 minutes.
          s1 = 19:03 -> 1143 minutes.
          e1 = 19:04 -> 1144 minutes.

          Total time: 1144-1141 = 3 minutes.

          We are to assign two intervals, each at least L.

          In the sample output:
              Interval0: 1141 to 1143 -> 2 minutes.
              Interval1: 1143 to 1144 -> 1 minute.

          So the minimum length is 1.

          But the sample output is:
              19:01 - 19:03
              19:03 - 19:04

          So the minimum length is 1.

          Why not 1.5? Because we are in minutes. We can only assign integer minutes? Actually, the problem allows minutes, so we can assign fractional minutes? But the output is in minutes. And the times are given in minutes.

          But the problem does not require integer minutes? The extension can be to any minute. We can set the boundaries to any minute. So L can be fractional? 

      However, the input and output are in minutes. The problem says "HH:MM", so the resolution is minutes.

      Therefore, we can binary search on integer minutes.

      But the sample input1: 
          3
          19:00 - 20:00  -> 1140 to 1200 minutes (length=60)
          21:08 - 21:24  -> 1268 to 1284 (length=16)
          22:00 - 22:46  -> 1320 to 1366 (length=46)

          Total time: from 1140 to 1366 = 226 minutes.

          The sample output has minimum length 15 minutes? Actually, the first interval: 19:00 to 20:15 -> 1140 to 1215: 75 minutes.
          second: 20:15 to 21:30: 1215 to 1290: 75 minutes? 
          third: 21:31 to 22:46: 1291 to 1366: 75 minutes? -> 1366-1291 = 75 minutes.

          But wait: 21:31 is 21*60+31=1260+31=1291, and 22:46= 22*60+46=1320+46=1366, and 1366-1291=75.

          So they are all 75 minutes? 

          However, the sample output has:

             19:00 - 20:15   -> 75 minutes.
             20:15 - 21:30   -> 21:30 is 21*60+30=1290 -> 1290-1215=75 minutes.
             21:31 - 22:46   -> 75 minutes.

          So minimum length is 75.

          How to achieve 75? The total time is 1366-1140=226 minutes. And 3*75=225, so it's tight.

      Therefore, we are allowed to have fractional minutes? But the output is in minutes. However, we are only allowed to output in minutes resolution.

      But the sample output has a gap: the second interval ends at 21:30 and the third starts at 21:31. That's a gap of one minute.

      In minutes: 21:30 = 1290, 21:31=1291.

      So we are allowed to set the boundaries to any minute.

      Therefore, we can use integer minutes and binary search on L in the range [0, (e_last-s0)//N] (approximately) but note: the maximum L might be floor((e_last-s0)/N) or ceil? Actually, the sample: 226//3 = 75.333 -> floor is 75, and we achieved 75.

      But note: we might achieve a non-integer L? Then we would have to use a floating point and then convert back to minutes for output. But the problem output is in minutes.

      However, the problem does not require that the minimum length L is integer, but the output boundaries are in minutes. So we can only assign boundaries to integer minutes. Therefore, we should binary search on integer minutes.

      But the sample input2: 
          We can achieve L=1, as the minimum length (because the second interval is 1 minute). But can we achieve L=2? 
          We have two intervals, each at least 2 minutes. Total length needed: 4 minutes. But the total time is 3 minutes. -> not feasible.

      Therefore, we do a binary search on integer L from 0 to (e_last-s0) (but we know the maximum is at most (e_last-s0) // 1, and we have N intervals, so L_max = (e_last-s0) // N? not necessarily, because we might have: 
          The first interval can be extended from s0 to some time, and the last is fixed at e_last, and the middle ones can be shifted.

      Actually, the maximum L is floor((e_last-s0 - (gaps?)) / something) -> not obvious.

      Alternatively, we can binary search on L in the range [0, (e_last-s0)] in integer minutes.

      Steps:

          low = 0
          high = (e_last - s0)   // total minutes

          while low <= high:
              mid = (low+high)//2
              if feasible(mid):
                  low = mid+1
              else:
                  high = mid-1

          Then the maximum feasible L is high.

      Then we need to output the schedule for L = high.

      How to output the schedule for a given L?

          We know L = high is feasible. We then run the backward propagation for L = high to get the boundaries.

          But the problem: if there are multiple solutions, output any.

          However, the sample input1: we got an output that has a gap. But our backward propagation for L=75 would give:

              Last interval: 
                  B[2]=1366
                  A[2]=min(s2, 1366-75)=min(1320, 1291)=1291.

              Then for i=1:
                  B[1]=A[2]=1291
                  A[1]=min(s1, 1291-75)=min(1268, 1216)=1216? -> but wait, the sample output has 1215 for the end of the first interval and then 1215 for the start of the second? 

          But our propagation:

              For i=1 (the second interval, 0-indexed index1):
                  B[1]=A[2]=1291
                  A[1]=min(s1, 1291-75)=min(1268, 1216)=1216.

              Then for i=0:
                  B[0]=A[1]=1216
                  A[0]=min(s0, 1216-75)=min(1140, 1141)=1140.   -> but 1216-75=1141? 

                  75 minutes: 1141 minutes = 19:01? 

          How to compute: 1216 minutes: 1216 // 60 = 20 hours, 1216 % 60 = 16 -> 20:16.
          1216-75 = 1141 minutes -> 1141/60=19 hours, 1141%60=1 -> 19:01.

          So A[0]=min(1140,1141)=1140.

          Then the schedule:

              [1140, 1216]  -> 76 minutes? 
              [1216, 1291]  -> 75 minutes
              [1291, 1366]  -> 75 minutes.

          But the sample output has:

              19:00 - 20:15 -> 1140 to 1215 (75 minutes)
              20:15 - 21:30 -> 1215 to 1290 (75 minutes)
              21:31 - 22:46 -> 1291 to 1366 (75 minutes)

          Why did we get 76 minutes for the first?

          The sample output has a gap of 1 minute between the second and third. We don't have that gap.

          How to achieve the sample output? 

          We did a contiguous assignment. But the problem does not require contiguous, only non-overlapping. And we are allowed to have gaps. 

          The sample output has a gap from 21:30 to 21:31. That is allowed.

          Our propagation for L=75: 
              We have the last interval: [1291,1366] -> 75 minutes.
              Then the second interval must end by 1291. The sample output ends the second at 21:30 = 1290, which is <1291. Then the sample output has a gap.

          How can we get the sample output schedule?

          We can use the following for the last interval:

              We are free to choose the last interval's start as long as it is at most s_last (which is 1320) and at least (e_last-75)=1366-75=1291, and we also must have the last interval cover the original [1320,1366]? 

              So we require the last interval to start at most 1320 and at least 1291. And we require the start of the last interval to be at least the end of the second interval.

          In the sample output, they set the last interval to start at 1291? 

          But the second interval ends at 1290. Then there is a gap.

          How to incorporate gaps? 

          In the backward propagation, we set the intervals as contiguous. But we are allowed to have gaps. 

          Actually, the non-overlapping condition only requires that the end of one is <= the start of the next. We can have a gap. 

          How to allow gaps? 

          In the backward propagation, we set the end of the previous interval to the start of the next. This forces contiguous. But we can set the end of the previous interval to a value less than the start of the next? 

          Why did we set it to the start of the next? Because in the propagation we did:

             B[i] = A[i+1]

          That forces contiguous.

          To allow gaps, we could set B[i] to any value in [e_i, A[i+1]]? But then we have more freedom.

          How to do the feasibility then? 

          This becomes more complex. 

      Given the complexity of the backward propagation that allows gaps, and the time constraint (N<=200), we can do a two-pass method: 

          We know that the schedule is defined by:
            A0 = s0
            B0 in [max(e0, A0+L), ???]
            A1 in [max(B0, s1), min(s1, e1-L)]   ??? 

      Alternatively, we can use a greedy that sets the intervals as left as possible for the first N-1 intervals, and then the last interval is fixed. But then we require the last interval to have at least L and cover the original and start at most s_last and at least the end of the previous.

      Or we can use the following for a given L to output the boundaries:

          We know the total freedom is the entire timeline [s0, e_last]. We wish to assign the intervals. 

          We can use a greedy from left to right for the first N-1 intervals, and then the last interval is fixed. 

          For the first interval:
             A0 = s0 (fixed)
             B0 = max(e0, A0+L)   [but then we can also extend the end further? However, we want to leave room for the next intervals, so we set it to the minimal: max(e0, s0+L)]

          For i from 1 to N-2:
             A_i = max(s_i, B_{i-1})   [to be non-overlapping: we must have A_i>=B_{i-1}, and to cover the original we must have A_i<=s_i? Actually, we are allowed to extend the start arbitrarily as long as we cover the original, so we can set A_i to any value in [B_{i-1}, s_i]]? But to cover the original, we require A_i<=s_i. 

             Then we set B_i = max(e_i, A_i+L)   [minimal end]

          For the last interval:
             A_{N-1} = max(s_{N-1}, B_{N-2})   [must be >=B_{N-2} and <=s_{N-1}]
             B_{N-1} = e_last (fixed)

             Then we require that the last interval has length at least L: 
                   e_last - A_{N-1} >= L   ->   A_{N-1} <= e_last - L

             and also we require that the last interval covers the original: 
                   A_{N-1} <= s_{N-} and we already have B_{N-1}=e_last>=e_{N-1} (so cover the end). 

             So we require: 
                   A_{N-1} = max(s_{N-1}, B_{N-2}) [wait, we set it to max(s_{N-1}, B_{N-2})? Actually, we set it to the maximum between what? We require A_{N-1}>=B_{N-2} and A_{N-1}<=s_{N-1}? So we set it to the minimal possible: we set A_{N-1}=B_{N-2} (if B_{N-2}<=s_{N-1}) and then we require that e_last - B_{N-2}>=L.

          Therefore, the condition for the last interval is: 
               if B_{N-2} > s_{N-1}: then we cannot have A_{N-1} in [B_{N-2}, s_{N-1}] -> fail.
               else: set A_{N-1}=B_{N-2}, and then require e_last - B_{N-2}>=L.

          Then the schedule is:

               A0 = s0
               B0 = max(e0, s0+L)
               for i=1 to N-2: 
                   A_i = max(s_i, B_{i-1})   # but we require A_i<=s_i, so if B_{i-1} > s_i, then fail. Otherwise, A_i = B_{i-1} (because we set it to the minimal to leave room for the next).
                   B_i = max(e_i, A_i+L)
               A_{N-1} = B_{N-2}   # if B_{N-2}<=s_{N-1}, else fail.
               B_{N-1} = e_last
               and check e_last - A_{N-1}>=L.

          This is the forward propagation.

          Then we can do a binary search on L using this forward propagation for the feasibility.

      Let's test with sample1 and L=75:

          s0=1140, e0=1200.
          A0=1140.
          B0 = max(1200, 1140+75)=max(1200,1215)=1215.

          i=1: 
             A1 = max(s1, B0) = max(1268,1215)=1268? 
             then B1 = max(e1, 1268+75)=max(1284,1343)=1343.

          Then for last:
             A2 = max(s2, B1) = max(1320,1343)=1343 -> but then we require A2<=s2 (1320) -> 1343>1320 -> fail.

      What went wrong? In the sample solution, the second interval is [20:15, 21:30] = [1215,1290]. 

          A1 should be 1215, not 1268.

          Why can we set A1=1215? 
             Because condition (a) requires that the amended interval covers the original [1268,1284]. So we require A1<=1268 and B1>=1284. 
             Also, non-overlapping: A1>=B0=1215.

          So A1 must be in [1215,1268]. 

          In the forward propagation, we set it to the minimal: 1215. But then we set B1 = max(e1, 1215+75)=max(1284,1290)=1290.

          Then for the last:
             A2 = min(s2, e2-75) in the backward propagation? 

          In the forward propagation for the last:

             A2 = max(s2, B1)=max(1320,1290)=1320? -> then B2 = e_last=1366, and length=1366-1320=46<75 -> fail.

          So we see that the forward propagation (greedy left) might fail even if there is a solution.

      Given the complexity, and since the constraints on N are only 200, and the time in minutes is at most 500 minutes, we can use the backward propagation that sets contiguous intervals and then yields a schedule. Even though contiguous, it might leave gaps in the amended schedule? Actually, in the backward propagation, we set the intervals contiguous. But the problem allows gaps. 

      Why in the sample output they have a gap? Because they found a non-contiguous solution.

      Our backward propagation for sample1 with L=75:

          A2 = min(1320, 1366-75)=min(1320,1291)=1291.
          B1 = A2 = 1291.
          A1 = min(1268, 1291-75)=min(1268,1216)=1216.  -> then the second interval is [1216,1291] -> length 75 minutes.
          B0 = A1 = 1291.
          A0 = min(1140, 1291-75)=min(1140,1216)=1140.   -> then the first interval is [1140,1291] -> length 151 minutes.

          But wait, the first interval length is 151, which>=75, and the second is 75, and the last is 75. 
          Also, the first interval covers [1140,1200]: 
               1140<=1140 (start) and 1291>=1200 -> covers.
          The second interval covers [1268,1284]: 
               A1=1216<=1268? -> 1216<1268, so the start is before the original start? That's allowed by condition (1): we are allowed to extend the start earlier. 
               and B1=1291>=1284 -> covers.

          The last: covers.

          Then we output:
             [1140,1291] -> 19:00 to ?: 1291 minutes = 21:31 (because 1291//60=21, 1291%60=31) -> 21:31.
             [1216,1291] -> 20:16 to 21:31  -> but 20:16 is 1216 minutes = 20*60+16=1216.
             [1291,1366] -> 21:31 to 22:46.

          This is contiguous in the last two intervals, but the first interval overlaps with the second? 
             first: [19:00, 21:31] 
             second: [20:16, 21:31]

          This overlap! 

      Why? The condition is non-overapping: the end of the first should be<= the start of the second. Here, B0=1291 and A1=1216, and 1291>=1216, so the first interval overlaps with the second.

      In the backward propagation, we set B0 = A1, and then A0 = min(s0, B0-L)=1140. 
          so the first interval is [1140,1291] and the second is [1216,1291] -> overlap from 1216 to 1291.

      How to avoid overlap? 

          The condition is: B[i] <= A[i+1]. In the backward propagation, we set B[i] = A[i+1]. This makes them contiguous. But then how did we get A0=1140 and A1=1216 with B0=1216 and B1=1291? 
          Then the first interval is [1140,1216] and the second [1216,1291] -> contiguous.

      In the example above, I see for the first interval: B0 = A1 = 1216 (not 1291) -> let me recompute:

          A2 = 1291.
          B1 = A2 = 1291.
          A1 = min(1268, 1291-75)=min(1268, 1216)=1216.
          then B0 = A1 = 1216 (not 1291) -> because in the for loop for i=0 (the first interval) in the backward propagation, we set:

              for i=1 (which is the second interval) in the backward propagation (i from N-2 down to 0: for N=3, i=1 then i=0) 

          for i=1: 
             B[1]=A[2]=1291
             A[1]=min(1268, 1291-75)=1216.

          for i=0:
             B[0]=A[1]=1216.
             A[0]=min(1140, 1216-75)=min(1140,1141)=1140.

          then the intervals:

             [0]: [1140,1216] -> length 76 minutes.
             [1]: [1216,1291] -> length 75 minutes.
             [2]: [1291,1366] -> length 75 minutes.

          This is contiguous and non-overlapping.

          But the sample output has a gap between the second and third? 

          sample output has the second ending at 21:30 and the third starting at 21:31.

          How to achieve that? 

          In the backward propagation, we set the last interval's start to 1291, which is 21:31. We could set it to 1290? 

          But condition: the last interval must be at least 75 minutes: 1366-1290=76>=75, and it must cover the original [1320,1366]: which it does.

          and the last interval's start can be as early as 1291? or as early as 1290? 

          In the backward propagation, we set A[2]= min(s_last, e_last-L)= min(1320, 1366-75)= min(1320,1291)=1291.

          We are not allowed to set it to 1290 because then we would be below the floor? 

          But condition (1) for the last interval: the amended interval must include the original. The original start is 1320. If we set the amended start to 1290, then we have 1290<=1320, so condition (1) is satisfied. 

          So we can set A[2] to any value in [max(s0, e_last- (anything>= the length requirement floor)?), s_last] and also>= the previous interval's end. 

          In the backward propagation, we set it to the highest possible within [?, s_last] and within the length constraint. That is, we set it to min(s_last, e_last-L) to. 
          Why choose the highest? Because then the previous intervals have more room.

          But if we set it to a lower value, then the previous intervals have even more room. 

          Therefore, to output a schedule, we can use the backward propagation as described for the feasibility, and then we have the boundaries.

          For sample1, we got:

             [0]: 1140 to 1216 (76 minutes)
             [1]: 1216 to 1291 (75 minutes)
             [2]: 1291 to 1366 (75 minutes)

          This is valid and has minimum length 75.

          The sample output has minimum length 75 as well.

          So we output:

             convert(1140) = "19:00"
             convert(1216) = "20:16"  (because 1216//60=20, 1216%60=16)

             for the first interval: "19:00 - 20:16"

          But the sample output first interval is "19:00 - 20:15". 

          Why 20:15? 20:15 = 20*60+15=1215.

          Then the first interval: 1140 to 1215: length 75 minutes.
          second: 1215 to 1290: length 75 minutes.
          third: 1291 to 1366: 75 minutes.

          How to achieve 1215 for the first interval's end? 

          In the backward propagation, we have the last interval: 
             A[2] = min(1320, 1366-75)=1291.
          then for the second interval: 
             B[1]=1291, then A[1]=min(1268, 1291-75)=1216.  -> because 1291-75=1216.
          then for the first: 
             B[0]=1216, then A[0]=min(1140,1216-75)=1140.

          How to get 1215? 

          We have freedom: for the second interval, we can set A[1] to any value in [ max(s0, B[0] from the first? ), but in the backward propagation we set it to min(s1, B[1]-L). 

          But we are not restricted to that. The backward propagation is for the feasibility check. For the construction, we can choose any A[i] in [s0, s_i] and any B[i] in [e_i, e_last] as long as the conditions hold.

          Specifically, for the second interval, we require:

             A[1] in [ B[0]=1216, 1268] ????? -> wait, the first interval's end is 1216, and the second interval's amended must start>=1216 and <=1268 (to cover the original start at 1268? actually condition (1) requires amended start<= the original start). 
             then the length must be at>=75.

          If we set A[1]=1216, then we must set B[1]>=max(e1, 1216+75)=max(1284,1291)=1291.

          Then the third interval must start at>=1291.

          So we cannot set the second interval to end at 1290.

          Therefore, the sample output might be obtained by a different assignment.

          Note: the sample output has the first interval ending at 1215 and the second ending at 1290. 
          Then the second interval: [1215,1290] -> length 75 minutes, which is>=75, and it covers the original [1268,1284] (because 1215<=1268 and 1290>=1284). 
          For the first interval: [1140,1215] -> covers [1140,1200] (1215>=1200) and length 75.

          then the third: [1291,1366] -> covers [1320,1366] (1291<=1320, 1366>=1366) and length 75.

          How to achieve this in the backward propagation? 

          We can try a different assignment for the last interval: 
             A[2] = 1291 (as before)
          then for the second interval: we are not contiguous; we can set the end of the second to 1290, which is <1291. 
          then the second interval: [ x, 1290] and then the third: [1291,1366].

          In the backward propagation for the second interval: 
             B[1] = 1290   (but we then must have B[1] >= e1=1284 -> yes)
             A[1] = min(1268, 1290-75)=min(1268,1215)=1215.

          then for the first: 
             B[0] = A[1]=1215
             A[0]=min(1140,1215-75)=min(1140,1140)=1140.   [1215-75=1140]

          then we have:
             [0]: [1140,1215] -> length 75.
             [1]: [1215,1290] -> length 75.
             [2]: [1291,1366] -> length 75.

          This is valid.

          How to allow this in the feasibility check? 

          In the backward propagation, we did contiguous assignment. To allow gaps, we can set the end of interval i to any value in [e_i, A[i+1]) (instead of exactly A[i+1]). 

          Then we would have more freedom. 

          Specifically, in the backward propagation for the last interval, we have fixed boundaries. 
          For interval i (0 to N-2), we require:
             A[i] = min(s_i, ???) and also the amended interval must cover the original and have length>=L.

          The challenge is to choose B[i] in [e_i, next_start] such that the length>=L and also the start A[i] is in [s0, s_i] and the amended interval covers [s_i, e_i].

          We want to leave as much room as possible for the left, so we would set B[i] as small as possible? 

          For the last interval: we have fixed boundaries.
          For i=N-2 down to 0:
             We can choose B[i] as any value in [max(e_i, A[i] from below ???), A[i+1]] that allows A[i] = min(s_i, something) 

          This is complex.

 Given the complexity and the low constraints (N<=200), and the time in minutes (at most 500 minutes), we can try a dynamic programming solution for the feasibility of L.

 However, the intended solution might be to use a binary search and then a greedy that sets the intervals from left to right and then from right to left to "adjust" the boundaries.

 A common solution for these types of problems is to use a binary search on L and then a linear greedy that sets the intervals as follows:

   // Forward: set the earliest possible end for each interval if we set the start as early as possible.
   A0 = s0
   B0 = max(e0, A0+L)

   for i=1 to N-1:
        // The next interval must start at least at B_{i-1} (non-overapping) and at most s_i (to cover the original start)
        // and must have length at least L, so it must end at least at start+L.
        // and also the end of the last is fixed.
        A_i = max( B_{i-1}, s_i )   // no, we can set A_i in [B_{i-1}, s_i]. But we want to leave room for the future, so we set it to the minimal: B_{i-1}
        B_i = max( e_i, A_i+L)

   // But then the last interval's end might not be e_last.

   // Backward: adjust for the fixed last end.
   // Start from the last and set the end to e_last, and then set the start to the latest possible (within the length>=L and covering the original) and then propagate left.

   // Then we can do: 
   Let's have an array for the amended schedule.

   // First, set the last interval:
   B_{N-1] = e_last
   A_{N-1] = max( s_{N-1}, e_last - L)   // to cover the original start: we require A_{N-1]<=s_{N-1], so if e_last-L > s_{N-1], then we must set A_{N-1}=s_{N-1} and then require that the length is e_last-s_{N-1]>=L -> which may fail. 
                                          // if e_last-L <= s_{N-1], then we set A_{N-1}=e_last-L.

   for i in range(N-2, -1, -1):
        // The next interval must end at most the start of the current interval.
        // We have amended interval i: it must end at most the start of the next interval.
        // and it must have length at least L, so we set B_i = min( e_i (wait, no, we can extend the end), actually condition (1) allows extending the end, so we can set B_i to any value>=e_i. 
        // but also to have non-overapping: B_i <= A_{i+1]
        // and length: B_i - A_i >= L.

        // In the forward pass, we have a candidate for A_i and B_i.

        // Adjust: set B_i = min( B_i (from forward), A_{i+1] )   // but then might break the length.
        // We require B_i >= e_i and B_i >= A_i+L and B_i<=A_{i+1]

        // So we set B_i = min( A_{i+1], max(e_i, A_i+L) ) 

        // Then if this assignment has B_i < max(e_i, A_i+L), then we cannot have both constraints -> fail.

        // But wait, we can also adjust A_i? 
        // We have from the forward pass A_i = some value, but we can possibly move A_i to a later time? 
        // However, condition (1) allows to extend the start to an earlier time, but not to a later time beyond the original start. 
        // So A_i can be any value in [s0, s_i]. 
        // and we require A_i <= s_i.

        // Given the constraint from the right: B_i in [max(e_i, A_i+L), A_{i+1}], we want to choose the smallest B_i to save room for the left, but also we can reduce A_i to allow a smaller B_i? 

        // Specifically, we require 
               A_i in [ some min value, s_i] such that there exists B_i in [max(e_i, A_i+L), A_{i+1}].

        // This requires: A_i <= s_i and A_i <= A_{i+1} - L and also we require A_i <= (something from the left) 

        // This becomes complex.

 Given the time, and since we have a working backward propagation for the contiguous assignment, and the only issue is that the sample output has a gap, but our contiguous assignment is also valid (has minimum length 75 and meets the conditions), we can output the contiguous assignment.

 The problem: "If there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them."

 Therefore, we output the schedule from the (contiguous) backward propagation for the maximal L.

 Steps for the solution:

  1. Convert the input to minutes.
  2. Binary search for the largest integer L such that the schedule is feasible by the contiguous backward propagation and meets:
        - A[0]==s0
        - B[i]>=e_i for every i
        - and also we require A[i]>=s0 for every i (or within [s0, e_last]) (which is ensured by the contiguous assignment and fixed endpoints).

  3. For the found L, run the contiguous backward propagation to get the boundaries.

  4. Convert boundaries back to HH:MM and output.

  How to convert minutes to HH:MM:

        hours = minutes // 60
        minutes = minutes % 60
        string: "{:02d}:{:02d}".format(hours, minutes)

  But note: the given time is between 16:00 and 23:59, so hours in [16,23].

  Example: 1140 minutes: 1140//60=19, 1140%60=0 -> "19:00"

  Example: 1216: 20*60=1200, 1216-1200=16 -> "20:16"

  But the sample output has "20:15", which is 1215.

  So for the sample input, our output for the first interval would be:

        "19:00 - 20:16"

      second: "20:16 - 21:31"
      third: "21:31 - 22:46"

  This is valid and has minimum length 75.

  However, the sample output has a different schedule. 

  Since any solution is acceptable, we output this.

  Let me test with sample2 for L=1:

      s0=1141, e0=1142, s1=1143, e1=1144.

      Last: 
          B[1]=1144.
          A[1]=min(s1, 1144-1)=min(1143, 1143)=1143.

      Then for i=0:
          B[0]=A[1]=1143.
          A[0]=min(s0, 1143-1)=min(1141, 1142)=1142? -> then A[0]=1142, which is not equal to s0=1141. -> fail for L=1.

  But we know L=1 should be feasible.

  Why for sample2, our contiguous backward propagation for L=1:

        A[1]=min(1143,1144-1)=min(1143,1143)=1143.
        B[0]=1143.
        A[0]=min(1141, 1143-1)=min(1141,1142)=1141.  [ because 1141 is the min]

        then A[0]=1141, which is s0. 

        covering:
           for i=0: B[0]=1143>=e0=1142 -> holds.
           for i=1: B[1]=1144>=1144 -> holds.

        also within [1141,1144]: 
           [0]: [1141,1143] -> length 2 minutes.
           [1]: [1143,1144] -> length 1 minute.

        minimum length=1, which is the desired L.

        output for sample2:
           first: 1141->19:01, 1143->19:03 -> "19:01 - 19:03"
           second: "19:03 - 19:04"

        which matches the sample output.

  Therefore, the solution is:

      Step 1: Parse input.
      Step 2: Convert to minutes.
      Step 3: 
          low = 0
          high = (e_last - s0)
          while low <= high:
              mid = (low+high+1)//2
              if feasible(mid): 
                  low = mid+1
              else:
                  high = mid-1

          L = high   (feasible)

      Step 4: 
          // run backward propagation for L = high to get A and B arrays.
          A = [0]*N
          B = [0]*N
          B[N-1] = e_last
          A[N-1] = min(s_last, e_last - L)
          for i in range(N-2, -1, -1):
              B[i] = A[i+1]
              A[i] = min(s[i], B[i]-L)

      Step 5: 
          // Convert each A[i] and B[i] to string in format "HH:MM"

      Step 6: Output.

  Let's run sample2 by hand for L=1: 
        s0=1141, e0=1142, s1=1143, e1=1144.
        e_last = e1=1144.

        A[1] = min(s1, e1-1)=min(1143, 1143)=1143.
        B[0] = A[1]=1143.
        A[0] = min(s0, 1143-1)=min(1141, 1142)=1141.

        Then the schedule: 
           [1141,1143] -> "19:01", "19:03"
           [1143,1144] -> "19:03", "19:04"

        Output:
           19:01 - 19:03
           19:03 - 19:04

  sample1 for L=75: 
        s0=1140, e0=1200, s1=1268, e1=1284, s2=1320, e2=1366.
        e_last=1366.

        A[2] = min(s2, e2-75)=min(1320, 1366-75=1291) = 1291.
        B[1] = A[2]=1291.
        A[1] = min(s1, 1291-75)=min(1268, 1216)=1216.
        B[0] = A[1]=1216.
        A[0] = min(s0, 1216-75)=min(1140, 1141)=1140.

        Then output for the first: [1140,1216] -> 19:00 to 20:16.
        second: [1216,1291] -> 20:16 to 21:31.
        third: [1291,1366] -> 21:31 to 22:46.

  This is what we have.

  However, note: the sample output for sample1 has a gap between the second and third, but our solution is contiguous. 

  But the problem allows non-overlapping, and contiguous is a special case of non-overlapping.

  Therefore, we output the schedule.

  But note: the sample output for sample1 has the first interval ending at 20:15, which is 1215, and the second ending at 21:30, which is 1290, and then the third starting at 21:31.

  Our solution for sample1 is different, but valid.

  Therefore, we are done.

  One more: sample2 in the problem has output as sample2 input with an extra minute in the first interval? 
        sample input2: 
           19:01 - 19:02
           19:03 - 19:04
        our output: 
           19:01 - 19:03
           19:03 - 19:04

        This is in the sample output.

  So we output.

  Implementation:

      We'll convert a time string "HH:MM" to minutes: 
          def to_minutes(s):
              h, m = s.split(':')
              return int(h)*60+int(m)

      Convert minutes to string: 
          def to_time(m):
              h = m // 60
              mm = m % 60
              return f"{h:02d}:{mm:02d}"

      Then the format: to_time(A[i]) + " - " + to_time(B[i])

  Note: the problem says the input times are between 16:00 and 23:59, so we don't have to worry about midnight.

  Let's code the feasibility check for a given L (in minutes) on the minute arrays.

      Given: 
          s = [ s0, s1, ... s_{N-1} ]   (in minutes)
          e = [ e0, e1, ... e_{N-1} ]   (in minutes)
          total_last = e[-1] (which is e_{N-1])

      Steps in feasibility(L):

          A = [0]*N
          B = [0]*N

          # Last interval
          B[-1] = e[-1]
          A[-1] = min(s[-1], B[-1]-L)

          # Iterate backwards from N-2 to 0
          for i in range(N-2, -1, -1):
              B[i] = A[i+1]
              A[i] = min(s[i], B[i]-L)

          if A[0] != s[0]:
              return False

          for i in range(N):
              if B[i] < e[i]:
                  return False

          return True

  But note: we also should ensure that the entire schedule is within [s0, e_last] and non-overlapping, but the contiguous assignment and the fixed endpoints ensure that.

  However, the covering of the original start: we have A[i] = min(s[i], B[i]-L) <= s[i] (by the min), so it covers the start. The covering of the end is explicitly checked.

  Therefore, we use this.

  Edge: when L=0, always feasible.

  Let's hope.

  We'll now write the editorial as the solution.

  Summary of the solution:

      We are to maximize the minimum length L of the intervals in the new schedule.

      We use binary search on L. For a candidate L, we check feasibility by:

          - Setting the last interval: 
               end = last_interval_original_end (fixed)
               start = min( last_interval_original_start, last_interval_original_end - L )

          - Then for i from the second last down to the first:
               end[i] = start[i+1]
               start[i] = min( original_start[i], end[i] - L )

          - Then we check:
               (1) The first interval's start must be exactly the original first start.
               (2) For every interval i, the end[i] is not earlier than the original end[i].

      If both conditions hold, then L is feasible.

      We search for the maximum L such that the conditions hold.

      Once we find the maximum L, we then construct the schedule using the same backward propagation.

      Then we output the schedule.

  Complexity: O(N * (e_last-s0)) which is about 200 * 500 = 100000, which is acceptable for 1 second.

  Let's hope.

  Note: the binary search runs about O(log(total_minutes)) = about log2(500) = 9 iterations.

  So total operations: 9 * 200 = 1800.

  We are done.

  However, note: the sample input2: when L=2, we require:

        last interval: 
            B[1]=1144.
            A[1]=min(1143, 1144-2)=min(1143,1142)=1142.
        then for i=0:
            B[0]=A[1]=1142.
            A[0]=min(1141, 1142-2)=min(1141,1140)=1140.
        then check: 
            A[0] (1140) != s0 (1141) -> fail.

        Also, we then check covering for the first interval: B[0]=1142>=e0=1142 -> holds.
        for the last: B[1]=1144>=e1=1144 -> holds.

        but the first start is 1140, which is not 1141 -> fail.

      Therefore, L=2 is not feasible.

  Correct.

  So the solution is as described.

  We'll now output the editorial accordingly.
