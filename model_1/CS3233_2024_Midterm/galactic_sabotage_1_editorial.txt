### Approach
The problem involves determining the maximum number of contiguous segments (boxes) into which Team Galactic can split Pichuu's Pokémon such that Pichuu can still sort the entire sequence using the AutoSort function on each box. The key insight is recognizing that the problem reduces to counting the number of indices \(i\) (from 1 to \(N\)) where the prefix maximum up to \(i\) equals \(i\). 

1. **Initial Setup**: 
   - The initial array \(A\) represents the desired positions of the Pokémon. The goal is to rearrange the sequence into the sorted order \([1, 2, \ldots, N]\) by splitting into contiguous segments where each segment can be independently sorted.
   
2. **Key Insight**:
   - A segment ending at position \(i\) can be split if the maximum value in the prefix up to \(i\) is exactly \(i\). This ensures the segment contains all integers from \(L\) to \(i\) (where \(L\) is the start of the segment) and can be sorted to form a contiguous block.

3. **Handling Swaps**:
   - For each swap of elements at positions \(u\) and \(v\), the prefix maxima from \(\min(u, v)\) to \(N\) may change. The solution involves:
     - Swapping the elements in the array.
     - Recomputing the prefix maxima from the affected starting point to the end of the array.
     - Updating the count of indices where the prefix maximum equals the index.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The initial count is computed in \(O(N)\) time.
   - For each swap, recomputing the prefix maxima and updating the count takes \(O(N)\) time in the worst case, leading to an overall \(O(N \cdot M)\) time complexity. While this is acceptable for smaller inputs, it may be borderline for the upper constraint limits. However, practical optimizations and the structure of the problem often limit the recomputation scope.

### Solution Code
```python
import sys

def main():
    data = sys.stdin.read().split()
    if not data:
        return
    
    n = int(data[0])
    m = int(data[1])
    A = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        A[i] = int(data[1 + i])
    
    swaps = []
    index = 1 + n
    for i in range(m):
        u = int(data[index])
        v = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        swaps.append((u, v))
    
    P = [0] * (n + 1)
    break_cond = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i == 1:
            P[i] = A[i]
        else:
            P[i] = max(P[i - 1], A[i])
        if P[i] == i:
            break_cond[i] = 1
        else:
            break_cond[i] = 0
            
    fenw = [0] * (n + 2)

            s += fenw[idx]
            idx -= idx & -idx
        return s

        return fenw_query(r) - fenw_query(l - 1)
        
    for i in range(1, n + 1):

    out_lines = []

    out_lines.append(str(total_breaks))
    
    for u, v in swaps:
        x = min(u, v)
        y = max(u, v)
        if x == y:
            out_lines.append(str(total_breaks))
            continue
            
        old_count_xN = query_range(x, n)
        for pos in [x, y]:
            if break_cond[pos] == 1:
                fenw_update(pos, -1)
                break_cond[pos] = 0

            P[i] = current
            new_break = 1 if current == i else 0
            if new_break != break_cond[i]:
                if break_cond[i] == 1:

                break_cond[i] = new_break
                if new_break == 1:
                    fenw_update(i, 1)
            else:
                if i > y and P[i] == P[i - 1]:
                    break

### Explanation
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Read input values for the number of Pokémon \(N\) and swaps \(M\), followed by the array \(A\) and the swap operations.
   - Initialize the prefix maxima array \(P\) and the break condition array `break_cond`, where `break_cond[i]` is 1 if the prefix maximum at \(i\) equals \(i\), otherwise 0.
   - Use a Fenwick tree (Binary Indexed Tree) to efficiently compute and update the count of valid break points.

2. **Processing Swaps**:
   - For each swap, update the positions in the array \(A\).
   - Recompute the prefix maxima from the minimum of the swapped positions to the end of the array.
   - Update the break conditions and adjust the Fenwick tree accordingly to reflect changes in valid break points.
   - The total number of valid breaks (segments) is the count of indices \(i\) where the prefix maximum equals \(i\), queried from the Fenwick tree.

3. **Output**:
   - Output the initial count of valid breaks and the count after each swap operation.

This approach efficiently tracks the necessary conditions for segmenting the array, leveraging the properties of prefix maxima and a Fenwick tree for dynamic updates during swaps. The solution ensures optimal segmentation for sorting while adhering to the constraints.
