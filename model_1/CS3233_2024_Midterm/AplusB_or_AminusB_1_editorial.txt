### Approach
The problem requires counting the number of pairs \((A, B)\) such that \(L \le B \le A \le R\) and \((A + B) \mid (A - B) = A + B\). The key insight is recognizing that the condition \((A + B) \mid (A - B) = A + B\) is equivalent to \((A - B) \& (B \ll 1) = 0\), where \(\ll\) denotes a left shift by 1. This means that for any bit set in \(A - B\), the corresponding bit in \(B \ll 1\) must be unset. 

To efficiently count the valid pairs within the constraints \(0 \le L \le R \le 2 \times 10^9\), we use digit dynamic programming (digit DP). The DP state is defined as follows:
- **bit_index**: The current bit being processed (from 0 to 31).
- **carry**: The carry from the addition \(B + x\) in the lower bits (0 or 1), where \(x = A - B\).
- **tight_low_B**: 1 if the bits chosen for \(B\) so far match the corresponding prefix of \(L\), else 0.
- **tight_high_B**: 1 if the bits chosen for \(B\) so far match the corresponding prefix of \(R\), else 0.
- **tight_bound**: 1 if the bits chosen for \(A = B + x\) so far match the corresponding prefix of \(R\), else 0.
- **prev_B**: The bit of \(B\) at the previous bit position (used to enforce the condition for the current bit).

The DP transitions involve iterating over possible bits for \(B\) and \(x\) (where \(x\) is derived from \(A - B\)), updating the state based on the current bits, and ensuring the constraints \(L \le B \le R\) and \(B \le A \le R\) are satisfied. The condition \((A - B) \& (B \ll 1) = 0\) is enforced by skipping transitions where the current bit of \(x\) is 1 and the previous bit of \(B\) is 1.

### Solution Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;

ll L_val, R_val;
ll dp[33][2][2][2][2][2];

ll dfs(int i, int carry, bool tl, bool th, bool tb, int prev) {
    if (i == 32) {
        return (carry == 0) ? 1 : 0;
    }
    if (dp[i][carry][tl][th][tb][prev] != -1) 
        return dp[i][carry][tl][th][tb][prev];
    
    ll res = 0;
    int L_i = (L_val >> i) & 1;
    int R_i = (R_val >> i) & 1;
    int R_bit = (R_val >> i) & 1;

    int low_B = tl ? L_i : 0;
    int high_B = th ? R_i : 1;

    for (int b = low_B; b <= high_B; b++) {
        for (int x = 0; x < 2; x++) {
            if (i > 0 && x == 1 && prev == 1) 
                continue;

            int total = b + x + carry;
            int bit = total & 1;
            int new_carry = total >> 1;

            if (tb) {
                if (bit > R_bit) 
                    continue;
            }

            bool new_tb = tb ? (bit == R_bit) : false;
            bool new_tl = tl ? (b == L_i) : false;
            bool new_th = th ? (b == R_i) : false;

            res += dfs(i+1, new_carry, new_tl, new_th, new_tb, b);
        }
    }

    return dp[i][carry][tl][th][tb][prev] = res;
}

int main() {
    cin >> L_val >> R_val;
    memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
    ll ans = dfs(0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0);
    cout << ans << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Digit DP State**: The DP state tracks the current bit position, carry from addition, tight constraints for \(B\) (ensuring \(B\) stays within \([L, R]\)), tight constraint for \(A = B + x\) (ensuring \(A \le R\)), and the previous bit of \(B\) (to enforce the condition \((A - B) \& (B \ll 1) = 0\)).

2. **Transitions**: For each bit position, the algorithm iterates over possible bits of \(B\) and \(x\) (the difference \(A - B\)). It checks if setting a bit in \(x\) violates the condition (i.e., if the previous bit of \(B\) was set). The addition \(B + x\) is computed, updating the carry for the next bit. The tight constraints are updated based on whether the current bits match the corresponding bits in \(L\) and \(R\).

3. **Base Case**: At the 32nd bit, the carry must be zero for the addition \(B + x\) to be valid, contributing 1 to the count if satisfied.

4. **Efficiency**: The DP has \(33 \times 2^5 = 1056\) states, each processed in constant time, making the solution efficient for the given constraints.

This approach efficiently counts valid pairs \((A, B)\) by leveraging digit DP to handle the large input range while enforcing the bitwise condition and constraints.
