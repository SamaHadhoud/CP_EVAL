### Approach
The problem requires finding the maximum value \( X \) such that there exists a permutation of the given objects where the minimum absolute difference between any two adjacent objects in the permutation is at least \( X \). 

#### Key Insight
The solution involves using binary search to determine the maximum feasible \( X \). For each candidate \( X \) during the binary search, we check if it's possible to arrange the objects such that every adjacent pair has a difference of at least \( X \). The core challenge is efficiently verifying this condition for a given \( X \).

#### Binary Search Setup
- **Search Space**: The possible values of \( X \) range from 0 to the maximum difference between any two objects in the sorted array (which is \( \text{max}(H) - \text{min}(H) \)).
- **Binary Search**: For each midpoint \( \text{mid} \) in the binary search range, we check if \( \text{can}(\text{mid}) \) (i.e., if a valid permutation exists with minimum adjacent difference at least \( \text{mid} \)).

#### Verification for a Given \( X \)
1. **Sorting**: First, sort the array of heights to facilitate efficient checks.
2. **Candidate Selection**: 
   - Identify several candidate starting points for building the permutation. These include:
     - The smallest and largest elements in the array.
     - Elements around the median (to cover potential starts in the middle of the array).
     - The first and last elements of the largest cluster. A cluster is defined as a maximal group of consecutive elements in the sorted array where each adjacent pair differs by less than \( X \). The largest cluster is the one with the most elements.
3. **Greedy Construction**:
   - For each candidate start, attempt to construct a valid permutation using a greedy approach:
     - **Initialization**: Begin with the candidate start and remove it from the multiset of available elements.
     - **Iterative Selection**: For each subsequent position, select the smallest available element that is at least \( X \) greater than the last selected element. If no such element exists, select the largest available element that is at least \( X \) less than the last selected element.
     - **Termination**: If at any point no valid element can be selected, the construction fails for that candidate. If all elements are used successfully, the candidate is valid.
4. **Result**: If any candidate start leads to a valid permutation, \( \text{can}(X) \) returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

### Explanation
1. **Binary Search**: The binary search efficiently narrows down the maximum \( X \) by checking feasibility for midpoint values.
2. **Candidate Selection**: Multiple starting points (like the smallest, largest, median elements, and endpoints of the largest cluster) are considered to maximize the chance of finding a valid permutation.
3. **Greedy Construction**: For each candidate start, the algorithm constructs a permutation by always choosing the next element that maintains the minimum difference \( X \), either by selecting the smallest available element that is at least \( X \) greater or the largest available element that is at least \( X \) smaller than the last selected element.
4. **Clustering**: Clusters help identify regions in the sorted array where elements are close together, which is crucial for selecting meaningful starting points that might lead to valid permutations.
5. **Efficiency**: The use of sorting, binary search within clusters, and efficient data structures (like dictionaries and sorted lists) ensures the solution handles the upper constraint limits effectively, operating within \( O(\log(\text{max\_diff}) \times \text{number\_of\_starts} \times n \log n) \) time complexity. This approach balances thoroughness with performance, ensuring correctness while adhering to problem constraints.
