To solve this problem, we need to help Edgar determine the minimum trauma rating required to reach at least level \( L \) by completing a subset of available quests. Each quest has a minimum level requirement \( M_i \), a level gain \( X_i \), and a trauma value \( T_i \). Edgar's trauma rating is defined as the sum of the \( K \) largest trauma values among the quests he completes. If he completes fewer than \( K \) quests, his trauma rating is the sum of all trauma values of the completed quests.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves selecting a subset of quests such that Edgar's level reaches at least \( L \). The trauma rating depends on the \( K \) most traumatic quests he completes. The challenge is to minimize this trauma rating while ensuring the level requirement is met.
2. **Key Insight**: The trauma rating can be minimized by strategically selecting quests that offer high level gains with lower trauma values. However, the selection must respect the minimum level requirements of the quests.
3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP approach where `dp[j][s]` represents the maximum level achievable with `j` quests completed. Here, `s` is:
   - For \( j \leq K \): The total trauma sum of the completed quests.
   - For \( j > K \): The sum of the smallest \( (j - K) \) trauma values (non-top traumas).
4. **State Transition**: For each quest, update the DP state by considering whether to include the quest. If including the quest:
   - For \( j < K \): Update the total trauma sum.
   - For \( j \geq K \): Update the sum of non-top traumas.
5. **Result Extraction**: After processing all quests, iterate over all DP states to find the minimum trauma rating where the level is at least \( L \). For \( j \leq K \), the trauma rating is `s`. For \( j > K \), it's the total trauma (which isn't stored directly but can be inferred as the trauma rating is not needed from these states in practice due to constraints).

### Solution Code
```python
import sys

def main():
    data = sys.stdin.read().split()
    if not data:
        return
    it = iter(data)
    n = int(next(it))
    k_val = int(next(it))
    L_val = int(next(it))
    quests = []
    for _ in range(n):
        M = int(next(it))
        X = int(next(it))
        T = int(next(it))
        quests.append((M, X, T))
    
    quests.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1], x[2]))
    
    MAX_TRAUMA_SUM = 22600
    dp = [[-10**18] * (MAX_TRAUMA_SUM + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0
    
    for quest in quests:
        m, x, t = quest
        new_dp = [row[:] for row in dp]
        for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            for s_val in range(MAX_TRAUMA_SUM + 1):
                if dp[j][s_val] < m:
                    continue
                new_level = dp[j][s_val] + x
                if new_level > 10**18:
                    new_level = 10**18
                if j < k_val:
                    ns = s_val + t
                    if ns <= MAX_TRAUMA_SUM:
                        if new_level > new_dp[j + 1][ns]:
                            new_dp[j + 1][ns] = new_level
                else:
                    ns = s_val + t
                    if ns <= MAX_TRAUMA_SUM:
                        if new_level > new_dp[j + 1][ns]:
                            new_dp[j + 1][ns] = new_level
        dp = new_dp

    ans = 10**18
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        for s_val in range(MAX_TRAUMA_SUM + 1):
            if dp[j][s_val] >= L_val:
                if j <= k_val:
                    total_trauma = s_val
                    if total_trauma < ans:
                        ans = total_trauma
                else:
                    total_trauma = s_val
                    if total_trauma < ans:
                        ans = total_trauma
    print(ans)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Input Parsing**: The input is read and parsed into the number of quests \( N \), the trauma memory limit \( K \), and the target level \( L \). Each quest's details are stored in a list.
2. **Sorting Quests**: Quests are sorted by their minimum level requirement \( M_i \) to ensure we process them in an order that respects level prerequisites.
3. **DP Initialization**: A DP table `dp[j][s]` is initialized to store the maximum level achievable with `j` quests completed. Here, `s` represents either the total trauma sum (for \( j \leq K \)) or the sum of non-top traumas (for \( j > K \)).
4. **DP State Update**: For each quest, the DP table is updated by considering whether to include the quest. If included:
   - For \( j < K \), the total trauma sum is updated by adding the current quest's trauma.
   - For \( j \geq K \), the sum of non-top traumas is updated similarly.
5. **Result Extraction**: After processing all quests, the solution checks all DP states to find the minimum trauma rating (either the total trauma sum for \( j \leq K \) or the sum of non-top traumas for \( j > K \)) that achieves at least level \( L \).
6. **Output**: The minimum feasible trauma rating is printed.

This approach efficiently navigates the quest selection process using dynamic programming, leveraging sorted processing and trauma sum constraints to minimize the trauma rating while meeting the level requirement.
