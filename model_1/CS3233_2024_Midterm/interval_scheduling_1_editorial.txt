### Editorial: Maximizing the Shortest Interval in Staggered Seating

#### Problem Analysis
The restaurant manager has divided the opening hours into $N$ non-overlapping time intervals (waves). Each interval must be adjusted such that:
1. The amended interval includes the original time interval (can only extend start earlier and/or end later).
2. The opening time (start of the first interval) and closing time (end of the last interval) remain unchanged.
3. The minimum length of the amended intervals is maximized.

The goal is to find a new schedule of intervals that satisfies these conditions and outputs any valid solution.

#### Key Insight
The problem requires maximizing the minimum length of the intervals. This is a classic "maximize the minimum" problem, which can be efficiently solved using binary search. The core idea is:
- **Binary Search on $L$**: For a candidate $L$, check if it's possible to adjust the intervals such that each interval has a length of at least $L$ minutes while respecting the constraints.
- **Feasibility Check**: Given $L$, determine if there exists a valid schedule. This involves propagating constraints backward (from the last interval to the first) to ensure:
  - The start of the first interval remains unchanged.
  - Each interval's end is at least its original end.
  - Intervals are non-overlapping (handled by making them contiguous in the propagation).

#### Algorithm Selection
1. **Binary Search**: Search for the largest $L$ in the range $[0, \text{total\_minutes}]$ where $\text{total\_minutes} = \text{last\_end} - \text{first\_start}$.
2. **Feasibility Check**:
   - **Backward Propagation**: Start from the last interval and move backward:
     - Fix the end of the last interval to its original end.
     - Set the start of the last interval to $\min(\text{original\_start}, \text{end} - L)$.
     - For each preceding interval, set its end to the start of the next interval, and its start to $\min(\text{original\_start}, \text{end} - L)$.
   - **Validation**:
     - The start of the first interval must match the original start.
     - For every interval, the end must be at least the original end.

            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1

#### Explanation
1. **Binary Search Setup**: The binary search is performed over possible values of $L$ (minimum interval length). The search space is $[0, \text{last\_end} - \text{first\_start}]$.
2. **Feasibility Check**:
   - **Backward Propagation**: The last interval's end is fixed. Its start is set to the minimum of its original start and $\text{end} - L$. For each preceding interval, its end is set to the start of the next interval, and its start is set to the minimum of its original start and $\text{end} - L$.
   - **Validation**: After propagation, check if the first interval's start matches the original and if all intervals end at or after their original ends.
3. **Output**: For the largest feasible $L$, recompute the schedule using backward propagation and convert the times back to "HH:MM" format.

This approach efficiently maximizes the minimum interval length while respecting all constraints, leveraging binary search and backward constraint propagation for optimality and correctness. The complexity is $O(N \log(\text{total\_minutes}))$, which is efficient for $N \leq 200$.
