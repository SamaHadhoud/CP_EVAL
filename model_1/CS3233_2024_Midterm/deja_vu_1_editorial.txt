### Problem Analysis
The problem requires finding the top \( l \) largest happiness ratings (sums) from all possible combinations of selecting exactly \( k \) objects out of \( n \) objects, each with a given happiness rating. The constraints are large (\( n, l \leq 10^6 \)), so generating all combinations is infeasible. Instead, we use a priority queue (max-heap) to efficiently generate the top sums without exploring all possibilities.

### Key Insight
1. **Sorting for Maximum Sums**: The largest sum is obtained by selecting the \( k \) largest elements. Sorting the array in descending order allows us to start with this maximum sum.
2. **Generating Next Largest Sums**: The next largest sums can be derived by:
   - **Swapping Elements**: Replace one selected element (from the initial \( k \) largest) with the largest unselected element. This generates a new sum slightly smaller than the current sum.
   - **Systematic Exploration**: Use a priority queue to explore new sums by either:
     - **Extending the Last Swap**: Replace the last added element with the next largest unselected element (without increasing the number of swaps).
     - **Adding a New Swap**: Replace another selected element (with a lower index) with the next unselected element (increasing the swap count).

### Algorithm Selection
1. **Sorting**: Sort the happiness ratings in descending order.
2. **Initial Sum**: Compute the sum of the first \( k \) elements (the maximum sum).
3. **Priority Queue (Max-Heap)**: 
   - **Initial States**: For each element in the initial \( k \) largest, generate a state by replacing it with the first unselected element (at index \( k \)).
   - **State Representation**: Each state is a tuple `(current_sum, i, j, depth)`, where:
     - `current_sum`: The sum after swaps.
     - `i`: The highest index in the initial selection that was removed.
     - `j`: The last added element's index.
     - `depth`: Number of swaps performed (initially 1).
   - **Generating New States**: From each state, generate two new states:
     - **Option 1 (Extend Swap)**: Replace the last added element (\( j \)) with the next unselected element (\( j+1 \)), keeping the same depth.
     - **Option 2 (New Swap)**: If fewer than \( k \) swaps have been done, replace the next highest element in the initial selection (\( i-1 \)) with the next unselected element (\( j+1 \)), increasing depth by 1.
4. **Output**: Extract the largest sums from the heap until \( l \) sums are collected. If the heap is exhausted before \( l \) sums, output -1 for the remaining.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n \log n) \) for sorting. The heap processes at most \( O(l) \) states, each with \( O(\log l) \) operations for insertion and extraction, leading to \( O(l \log l) \) for heap operations. Total complexity is \( O(n \log n + l \log l) \), which is efficient for \( n, l \leq 10^6 \).
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(n) \) for storing the array and \( O(l) \) for the heap, which is feasible within 1024 MB.

### Solution Explanation
1. **Sorting and Initial Setup**: The happiness ratings are sorted in descending order. The initial maximum sum is the sum of the first \( k \) elements.
2. **Heap Initialization**: For each element in the initial \( k \), create a state where that element is swapped with the first unselected element (at index \( k \)). Push these states into the max-heap.
3. **Processing States**: Extract the largest sum from the heap. For each extracted state:
   - **Extend Swap**: If there's a next unselected element, replace the last added element with it (new state with same depth).
   - **New Swap**: If possible, replace the next element in the initial selection (index \( i-1 \)) with the next unselected element (new state with depth increased by 1).
4. **Output Handling**: Output the extracted sums. If fewer than \( l \) sums are generated, output -1 for the remaining.

### Correctness
- **Base Case**: The largest sum is correctly the sum of the top \( k \) elements.
- **Subsequent Sums**: Each new state is derived by a small perturbation (swap) of a previous state, ensuring the next largest sums are generated in descending order.
- **Completeness**: All possible sums that could be among the top \( l \) are explored systematically without duplication, leveraging the heap's property to always extract the next largest sum.

This approach efficiently narrows down the exploration to only the most promising candidates using the heap, ensuring optimal performance for large inputs.

### Sample Walkthrough
**Sample Input 1**: `4 2 6` with happiness ratings `[3, 2, 3, 3]` (sorted: `[3, 3, 3, 2]`).
- **Initial Sum**: `3 + 3 = 6`.
- **Initial States**: 
  - Replace element at index 1 (value 3) with element at index 2 (value 3): sum = 6, state `(6, 1, 2, 1)`.
  - Replace element at index 0 (value 3) with element at index 2 (value 3): sum = 6, state `(6, 0, 2, 1)`.
- **Heap Processing**:
  - Extract 6 (base), output 6.
  - Extract 6 (from `(6, 1, 2, 1)`), output 6. Generate:
    - Option 1: Replace index 2 with 3: sum = 5, state `(5, 1, 3, 1)`.
    - Option 2: Replace index 0 (since depth < 2) with 3: sum = 5, state `(5, 0, 3, 2)`.
  - Extract 6 (from `(6, 0, 2, 1)`), output 6. Generate:
    - Option 1: Replace index 2 with 3: sum = 5, state `(5, 0, 3, 1)`.
  - Extract 5 (from `(5, 1, 3, 1)`), output 5.
  - Extract 5 (from `(5, 0, 3, 2)`), output 5.
  - Extract 5 (from `(5, 0, 3, 1)`), output 5.
- **Output**: `[6, 6, 6, 5, 5, 5]`.

**Sample Input 2**: `5 1 10` with all happiness ratings 1.
- **Initial Sum**: 1.
- **Initial State**: Replace index 0 with index 1: sum = 1, state `(1, 0, 1, 1)`.
- **Heap Processing**:
  - Extract 1 (base), output 1.
  - Extract 1, output 1. Generate: Option 1: Replace index 1 with 2: `(1, 0, 2, 1)`.
  - Similarly, generate states for indices 3 and 4, each outputting 1.
  - After 5 ones, the heap is empty. Output -1 for the next 5.
- **Output**: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`.

This approach efficiently handles the constraints by leveraging sorting and a priority queue to explore only relevant sums.
