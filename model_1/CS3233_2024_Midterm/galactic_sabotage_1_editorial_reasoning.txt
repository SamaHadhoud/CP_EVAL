We are given an array A[1..N] which is a permutation. Initially, all Pokemon are in one box.

Team Galactic can split the array of Pokemon (which is initially in one box) into contiguous segments (boxes). They want to maximize the number of boxes (K) such that after the split, Pichuu can still sort the entire PC by using AutoSort on each box individually (so each box can be rearranged arbitrarily, but the relative order of boxes remains).

What does it mean for Pichuu to be able to sort the entire PC? Since each box can be rearranged arbitrarily, the entire sequence of Pokemon (when reading from leftmost box to rightmost and within a box from left to right) must be rearrangeable to the identity permutation? Actually, note: the goal is to have the current i-th Pokemon become the A_i-th in the final ordering. But note: the problem states that the current i-th should become the A_i-th. However, observe the sample:

Sample Input #1: 
6 5
3 1 2 5 4 6

This means:
- The Pokemon currently at position 1 should end up at position 3.
- The Pokemon currently at position 2 should end up at position 1.
- etc.

But note: after sorting, we want the entire PC to be in increasing order of the desired positions? Actually, the problem says: "the current i-th Pokemon becomes the A_i-th Pokemon". This means that after sorting, the Pokemon that was originally at position i should be placed at position A_i. However, note that the entire PC is one long sequence (by the ordering defined: box by box, and left to right in a box). Therefore, the final sequence of the entire PC must be such that the Pokemon that should be at position 1 is first, then the one for position 2, and so on.

But wait: if we break the sequence into boxes, then each box can be independently rearranged. So the condition is that the entire sequence (if we ignore the box boundaries) must be rearrangeable to the permutation [1,2,...,N]? Actually, no: the goal is that for each i, the Pokemon originally at position i ends up at position A_i. However, note that the PC boxes are fixed by Team Galactic, and then AutoSort rearranges each box arbitrarily. So the relative order of boxes is fixed, but within a box the order can change arbitrarily.

Therefore, after the split, we have a sequence of boxes. Then, we can rearrange each box arbitrarily. The entire sequence of the PC (by concatenating the boxes) must be the identity permutation? Actually, the identity permutation in terms of the Pokemon's desired positions? Let me reify:

Let the current sequence of Pokemon (in one box) be: [P1, P2, ..., PN]. And we know that the Pokemon at position i (which is Pi) should go to position A_i. But note: the desired outcome is that the entire sequence becomes [1,2,...,N]? Actually, no. The problem says: "the current i-th Pokemon in the PC becomes the A_i-th". This is equivalent to: we require that the Pokemon that is currently at position i (which we can denote as having an original index i) should end up at the global position A_i.

But note: after we split the boxes and then rearrange each box arbitrarily, we are free to assign the positions arbitrarily within the boxes. However, the boxes are fixed and contiguous. Therefore, the entire sequence (after rearranging each box arbitrarily) must be the sequence [1, 2, 3, ..., N] because the Pokemon that should be at position 1 must be placed somewhere, and so on. But wait: actually, the Pokemon are not labeled by numbers 1 to N? The problem does not explicitly say, but note the constraints: A is a permutation of [1..N]. So we can assume that the Pokemon are labeled by the numbers 1 to N? Actually, the problem does not say that. But note: the array A tells us that the Pokemon at position i should become the A_i-th in the entire PC. Therefore, we can think of the Pokemon as having an inherent identity? Actually, no: we are moving the same set of Pokemon. The key is: we have a permutation A, and we wish to rearrange the entire sequence so that the value that appears at position i is the value that should be at position i? But wait: the problem does not state that the Pokemon are labeled by distinct numbers. However, the constraints say that A is a permutation. And the sample: [3,1,2,5,4,6] -> meaning that the first Pokemon (which is the number 3) should become the third? Actually, we have to be careful.

Let me reinterpret: 
We have an initial sequence: the first Pokemon is the one that is supposed to end up at position 3, the second at position 1, and so on.

But after sorting, the entire PC should be in increasing order of the positions: meaning the first Pokemon in the entire PC should be the one that is assigned to position 1, the second to position 2, etc. Therefore, the desired sorted sequence is: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

Now, what is the initial sequence? The initial sequence is given by the array A? Actually, the array A is defined as: the current i-th Pokemon in the PC becomes the A_i-th. This is equivalent to: the Pokemon that is currently at position i must end up at the global position A_i.

Therefore, if we let the current sequence be S[1..N] = [s1, s2, ..., sN], then we require that after sorting, the Pokemon s_i must be placed at position A_i.

But note: after sorting, the entire sequence must be the identity permutation? Actually, no. The entire sequence must be such that the Pokemon that should be at position 1 is at the first position, the one for position 2 at the second, etc. So the sorted sequence is [1, 2, 3, ..., N]. Therefore, the Pokemon that ends up at position j must be the one that is labeled j? But wait: how are the Pokemon labeled? The problem doesn't assign labels. We can instead think of the Pokemon by their desired position.

Alternatively, we can assign to the Pokemon that must end up at position j the label j. Then, the initial sequence is: at position i we have the Pokemon labeled A_i. Why? Because the Pokemon at position i must go to position A_i, so that Pokemon is the one that should be at position A_i, hence we label it as A_i.

Therefore, the initial sequence is: [A_1, A_2, ..., A_N]. And we wish to rearrange it to [1,2,...,N] by:
1. Splitting the sequence into contiguous segments (boxes) arbitrarily (with the constraint that the segments are contiguous and the relative order of the boxes is preserved) and then
2. Independently rearranging each segment arbitrarily.

What is the condition that a splitting into boxes allows the entire sequence to be rearranged to [1,2,...,N]? Since we can rearrange each box arbitrarily, the only constraint is that the multiset of numbers in each box must be exactly the set of consecutive numbers that should appear in that segment of the sorted sequence? Actually, no: the entire sorted sequence is fixed: [1,2,...,N]. Therefore, the boxes must cover consecutive segments of the sorted sequence? But note: we can rearrange arbitrarily within the box, so the numbers in a box can be in any order. However, the entire concatenation of boxes must yield the sorted sequence [1,2,...,N]. Therefore, the boxes must be contiguous in the sorted sequence? Actually, no: because the boxes are fixed in the order of the original sequence. But the sorted sequence must be [1,2,...,N]. Therefore, the boxes must cover disjoint sets of numbers that form consecutive intervals in the sorted sequence? Why?

Consider: if we have a box that contains the numbers {1,3}, then no matter how we rearrange this box, we cannot get the consecutive sequence [1,2] because 2 is missing. Therefore, the numbers in a box must form a set of consecutive integers? Actually, no: the entire sorted sequence is consecutive. However, we require that the entire sequence becomes [1,2,...,N]. Therefore, the boxes must be such that the numbers in each box form a set of consecutive integers? Not exactly: they must form consecutive intervals? For example, if the entire sequence is [1,2,3,4,5,6] and we split into boxes [1,2,3] and [4,5,6], then each box contains consecutive integers. But what if we have a box [1,3,2]? Then we can rearrange it to [1,2,3] which is consecutive. However, the numbers in the box are the consecutive integers from 1 to 3. So the set of numbers in each box must form a contiguous interval of integers.

Therefore, the condition for a splitting is that the set of numbers in each contiguous segment (box) must be a contiguous interval. Moreover, the intervals must be consecutive and non overlapping? Actually, the entire set of numbers is [1..N] so the intervals must cover [1..N] without gaps and the boxes are in the order of increasing numbers? Not necessarily: the boxes are in the order of the original sequence. However, the entire sorted sequence is [1,2,...,N]. Therefore, the boxes must appear in increasing order of the numbers they contain? Specifically, the smallest number in the first box must be 1, and then the next box must contain the next consecutive set, etc. But note: the boxes are fixed in the order of the original sequence. Therefore, the condition is:

1. The multiset of numbers in each box must be a contiguous interval of integers (for example, {a, a+1, a+2, ..., b}).
2. The boxes must be arranged such that the intervals are increasing: the first box covers [1, x], the second [x+1, y], etc.

But note: the boxes are contiguous segments of the original sequence. Therefore, the condition for the splitting is that we can break the array A (which is the initial sequence) at a position i (between i and i+1) if and only if the prefix [1..i] contains the set {1,2,...,x} for some x and the suffix [i+1..N] contains {x+1,...,N}. However, this is not enough: we might have multiple breaks. Actually, we want to maximize the number of boxes.

But note: Team Galactic wants to maximize the number of boxes (K) and they must ensure that Pichuu can still sort the PC (i.e., the condition above holds). So we wish to break the sequence into as many contiguous segments as possible such that in each segment the set of numbers forms a contiguous interval? And also, the entire sequence of boxes must cover [1..N] without gaps? Actually, the condition that the intervals are consecutive and increasing is automatically satisfied if the entire sequence is broken into contiguous intervals that are contiguous in the integer set? Because the entire set is [1..N], and if we break the sequence into segments that are contiguous intervals, then we can assign the boxes so that the intervals are in increasing order? But note: the boxes are fixed in the order of the original sequence. However, the numbers in the boxes might not be in increasing order? For example, if we have the sequence [3,1,2,5,4,6] and we break into [3,1,2] and [5,4,6], then the first box has the set {1,2,3} and the second {4,5,6} which are consecutive intervals. Then we can rearrange the first box to [1,2,3] and the second to [4,5,6] and the entire sequence becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6]. 

But what if the sequence is [3,1,2,5,6,4]? Then if we break into [3,1,2] and [5,6,4], the second box has the set {4,5,6} which is contiguous, so we can rearrange to [4,5,6]? But then the entire sequence becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6] which is sorted. So the condition is only that the set of numbers in each contiguous segment is a contiguous interval.

However, note that the boxes must cover the entire set [1..N] without gaps. Therefore, the union of the sets must be [1..N] and the sets must be contiguous intervals. And the boxes are in the order of the original sequence. But the contiguous intervals in the integer set must be consecutive? Actually, if the boxes are in the order of the original sequence, then the intervals of integers they contain must be increasing? Because the entire sorted sequence must be increasing. Therefore, the interval of the first box must be [1, x], the second [x+1, y], etc. So the condition is:

- The entire array must be partitioned into contiguous segments such that the set of numbers in the k-th segment is exactly [a_k, a_k + (length_k - 1)] for some a_k, and the intervals [a_k, b_k] are consecutive and non overlapping and cover [1..N].

Therefore, the problem reduces to: 
We are given an array A[1..N] (a permutation). We wish to split the array into as many contiguous segments as possible such that the set of numbers in each segment forms a contiguous interval. Moreover, the entire set of numbers must be [1..N] and the segments must cover consecutive intervals of integers.

How can we compute the maximum number of boxes (splits) we can have?

Note: we can always have one box (no split). We want the maximum number of splits.

Let's define:
- Let M_i = max(A[1..i])
- Let m_i = min(A[1..i])

But note: if the prefix [1..i] has min = a and max = b, then the set of numbers in the prefix is contiguous if and only if the number of distinct numbers in [1..i] is equal to (b - a + 1). Moreover, for the entire segment to form an interval, we require that a = 1? Not necessarily: but for the entire array to be partitioned into consecutive intervals, the first segment must start at 1. Actually, the entire set of numbers is [1..N]. Therefore, the first segment must contain 1. Similarly, the last segment must contain N.

Condition for a break at position i (meaning we end a segment at i and start a new segment at i+1) is that the segment ending at i must form a contiguous interval and the remaining segment [i+1..N] must form the rest? But we want to maximize the number of breaks. We can use greedy: we traverse and whenever the current segment (from the last break to the current index) forms a contiguous interval, then we can break? But note: we require that the entire sequence is partitioned into consecutive intervals. Moreover, the consecutive intervals must be in increasing order. Therefore, the first segment must be [1, x], the next [x+1, y], etc.

Therefore, a necessary condition for a break at i is that the set of numbers in the current segment (from the last break to i) is exactly [L, R] for some L and R, and L must be the next consecutive integer after the previous segment's R.

But we are starting at 1. So the first segment must start at 1. Then the next segment must start at the next integer which is R1+1, etc.

How to count the maximum number of segments? We can use dynamic programming? But note: N up to 500,000.

Alternatively, we can traverse and use the following condition: 
We can break at position i if and only if the current segment (from the last break to i) has min = L (the next expected starting number) and max = L + (segment length - 1) and the segment contains exactly consecutive integers? Actually, we can check by: the max of the segment is L + (number of elements - 1) and the min is L? But note: the segment might not contain duplicates? Actually, the array is a permutation, so duplicates do not occur.

But the condition for the entire segment to be contiguous is: 
  max - min + 1 = (number of elements)

Therefore, we can do:

We traverse i from 1 to N, and we want to know: if we break at i, then the segment from the last break (or from 1) to i forms a contiguous interval? But what is L? It must be the next consecutive number after the last segment. Actually, the entire set of numbers must cover [1..N] without gaps, so the first segment must start at 1. Then the next segment must start at (max of first segment) + 1, etc.

Therefore, we can do:

  Let L = 1 (the next starting number for the next segment)
  Let count = 0 (number of segments so far)
  Let i = 1
  We traverse the array and maintain the min and max of the current segment.

But note: we want to maximize the number of segments. This greedy: we break as soon as we can.

However, consider: 
  Array: [1, 3, 2, 4]
  We can break after [1] -> then we have segment [1] (min=1, max=1, and length=1 -> contiguous) -> then next segment [3,2] -> min=2, max=3, and length=2 -> 3-2+1=2 -> contiguous? But wait, the set {2,3} is contiguous. Then we break again? Then we have three segments: [1], [3,2], [4] -> total 3.

But can we break earlier? Actually, we can also break after [1,3,2]? Then we get two segments: [1,3,2] and [4]. But we want as many as possible. So greedy: break as soon as the current segment is contiguous and the min is the next expected starting number.

But note: the next expected starting number for the next segment is the current segment's max + 1? Actually, the segments must be consecutive intervals. So if the current segment is [L, R], then the next segment must start at R+1.

Therefore, the greedy algorithm:

  L = 1 (the next starting number for the next segment)
  count = 0
  current_min = a large number, current_max = a small number
  i = 1
  While i <= N:
      We extend the current segment to include A[i].
      Then we update current_min = min(current_min, A[i])
      current_max = max(current_max, A[i])
      Then we check: if the current segment has min = L and the set of numbers in the segment is contiguous? 
        But note: if the min is L and the max = L + (length - 1) then the set is contiguous? Actually, because the segment has no duplicates and we have exactly (max - min + 1) distinct numbers and the segment has that many elements? Actually, the segment has (max-min+1) distinct numbers? But we have exactly (max-min+1) numbers? Since the segment has length = (max-min+1) and all distinct? Then it must be the entire set of numbers from min to max.

      However, we also require that the min is L? Because we are expecting the next segment to start at L.

      So condition: 
          current_min == L and current_max - current_min + 1 == (i - start_index + 1)

      But wait: we don't have the start_index? Actually, we are traversing from the last break. We can maintain the start index of the current segment? 

      Alternatively, we can maintain the length of the current segment? Actually, we are traversing one by one. But note: we are breaking as soon as we can. So we can do:

          Let j = last break position + 1 (initially 1). Then we are considering i from j to ... until we can break.

      However, we want to break as soon as possible to maximize the number of segments. But note: we are forced to break only when the segment becomes contiguous and the min is L? Actually, we cannot break arbitrarily: we must break when the segment is contiguous and the min is L? Because then the segment covers [L, L+len-1] and the next segment must start at L+len.

      Therefore, if we break at i, then we set:
          count++ 
          L = current_max + 1
          reset current_min and current_max, and start the next segment at i+1.

      Then we continue.

      But what if the condition is not met? Then we just extend.

  However, is greedy safe? Consider: 
        [1, 3, 2, 4]

        i=1: 
          current_min=1, current_max=1, length=1 -> 1-1+1=1 -> condition holds? and min=1 (which is L=1) -> break. 
          Then we have a segment [1]. Then set L=2.

        i=2: 
          segment [3]: min=3, max=3, length=1 -> condition: min should be L=2 -> fails.

        i=3:
          segment [3,2]: min=2, max=3, length=2 -> 3-2+1=2 -> holds and min=2 which is L? -> so break. 
          Then we have segment [3,2] -> then set L=4.

        i=4:
          segment [4]: min=4, max=4, length=1 -> holds and min=4 which is L? -> break.

        Total segments: 3.

      This matches.

  But consider: [2, 1, 4, 3]

      We start: 
        L=1.
        i=1: [2] -> min=2, max=2 -> min != 1 -> continue.
        i=2: [2,1] -> min=1, max=2, length=2 -> 2-1+1=2 -> holds and min=1 which is L? -> break. 
        Then set L=3.
        Then segment [4]: min=4, max=4 -> min != 3 -> continue.
        i=3: [4] -> not break.
        i=4: [4,3] -> min=3, max=4, length=2 -> 4-3+1=2 -> holds and min=3 which is L? -> break.

        Total segments: 3.

      But can we break into 4 segments? [2], [1], [4], [3]? 
          [2]: min=2, max=2 -> but we are expecting the first segment to start at 1? -> no. 
          Actually, the first segment must start at 1. So we cannot break at [2] as the first segment.

      Therefore, the greedy is: we must form the segments in increasing order of the starting number.

      However, the problem: the entire sorted sequence must be [1,2,...,N]. So the segments must be in increasing order. Therefore, the first segment must start at 1. So we cannot break until we have included 1.

      Therefore, the greedy algorithm is:

        segments = 0
        L = 1
        j = 1 (current start index)
        min_val = INF, max_val = -INF

        for i in range(1, N+1):
            min_val = min(min_val, A[i])
            max_val = max(max_val, A[i])

            # Check if we can break at i?
            if min_val == L and max_val - min_val + 1 == (i - j + 1):
                segments += 1
                L = max_val + 1
                j = i+1
                min_val = INF
                max_val = -INF

        Then the answer is segments.

      But note: the entire array must be processed. And we break the array at every such point.

      How about the last segment? It must also form a contiguous interval? Yes, and the min for that segment must be L (which is the next expected) and the max is L + (length-1). Then we break.

      However, what if we don't break the entire array? Then we have one segment? But the greedy above breaks only when the condition holds.

      But note: the condition must hold eventually because the entire array is a permutation of [1..N]. The entire array has min=1, max=N, and length = N -> condition: min==L (which is 1) and max-min+1 = N -> holds. So we break at the last element.

      Therefore, the greedy will break the entire array.

      Now, the answer for the problem is the number of segments we get? But note: the problem asks for the maximum number of boxes. And we are breaking as soon as we can, which maximizes the number of segments? Actually, we break at every possible opportunity? 

      Why is this maximal? Because we break as soon as we have a contiguous segment starting at L. If we did not break at i, then we extend. But if we break at i, then we have a segment. If we don't break at i, then the segment might become larger and we might get fewer breaks? Actually, by breaking early we are making more segments. Therefore, the greedy is to break as soon as the condition holds.

      However, is it possible that by not breaking at i, we might get more segments in the future? 

      Example: 
        Array: [1, 3, 2, 4] 
        If we break at i=1: then we get [1] and then the rest [3,2,4]. Now the next segment: 
            i=2: [3] -> min=3, L=2 -> not break.
            i=3: [3,2] -> min=2, max=3 -> contiguous and min=2 (which is L=2) -> break -> then [3,2] becomes a segment, then [4] becomes a segment -> total 3.

        What if we didn't break at i=1? 
            Then we have [1,3,2] at i=3: 
                min=1, max=3, length=3 -> 3-1+1=3 -> contiguous? and min=1 which is L=1 -> break. Then we have one segment [1,3,2] and then [4] as the next segment -> total 2.

        So by breaking at i=1 we get more segments.

      Therefore, the greedy of breaking as soon as the condition holds yields the maximal number of segments.

      Therefore, the algorithm for the initial state is:

        segments = 0
        L = 1
        j = 1
        min_val = a big number, max_val = a small number.

        for i from 1 to N:
            min_val = min(min_val, A[i])
            max_val = max(max_val, A[i])
            if min_val == L and max_val - min_val + 1 == (i - j + 1):
                segments += 1
                L = max_val + 1
                j = i+1
                min_val = a big number
                max_val = a small number

        Then output segments.

      However, note: the problem then has M swaps. Each swap swaps two elements in the array. And we must output the answer after each swap.

      But constraints: N, M up to 500,000.

      We cannot run the greedy O(N) for each swap -> total O(N*M) = 25e10 which is too slow.

      We need a dynamic structure that supports:
        - Swapping two elements in the array.
        - Querying the maximum number of contiguous segments we can form.

      How can we do that?

      Observing the greedy algorithm: it traverses from left to right and breaks the array when a condition is met. The condition for a break at position i is:
          min_val = L and max_val - min_val + 1 = (i - j + 1)

      But note: the condition for the entire array is defined by the entire array? Actually, the greedy is sequential. However, note that the breaks are determined by the entire prefix? But the breaks are independent? Actually, the breaks are determined by the entire array? Specifically, the value of L for the next segment depends on the previous segment.

      Therefore, the entire process is deterministic and sequential. But we note that the greedy algorithm is O(N) per query.

      Alternatively, we can think: the breaks are at positions where the prefix [1..i] has the property that the set of numbers is exactly the consecutive integers from 1 to k (for some k). Then the next segment must start at k+1.

      Actually, the entire array is partitioned by breaks at positions i_1, i_2, ... such that the segment from the last break to i_j has min = L_j and max = L_j + (length_j - 1). 

      How many breaks? We can define:

          Let F(i) = the maximum number of segments we can form for the prefix [1..i].

          Then F(i) = max { F(j) + 1 } for all j < i such that the segment [j+1, i] is contiguous and the segment [j+1, i] has min = L and the previous segment must have ended at j with the last number being L-1? 

      But note: the entire array must be partitioned in increasing intervals. Therefore, the segment that ends at i must start at j+1 and the numbers in [j+1, i] must be [L, L + (i-j-1)] for L = the next consecutive number after the last segment's max.

      How to compute L? The entire set of numbers that appeared in [1..j] must be [1, L_prev] so the next segment must start at L_prev+1.

      Therefore, if we let F(i) = the maximum number of segments for the prefix [1..i] and let G(i) = the maximum number in the last segment (i.e., the last segment ends at i and has max = G(i)), then we have:

          F(i) = max_{j: [j+1, i] forms a contiguous interval and the min of [j+1,i] = G(j)+1 } { F(j) + 1 }

      And then G(i) = min of [j+1,i] + (length - 1) = min_{j+1..i} + (i - j - 1) ??? Actually, the max of the segment [j+1,i] is min_{j+1..i} + (i - j - 1) if the segment is contiguous? 

      But note: the segment is contiguous if and only if max = min + (length-1). So the max is min + (i-j-1).

      Therefore, G(i) = min_{j+1..i} + (i - j - 1)

      Then the condition is: 
          min_{j+1..i} = G(j) + 1   [because the next segment must start at G(j)+1]

      Then we have:

          F(i) = max_{j} { F(j) + 1 } for j such that:
              min_{j+1..i} = G(j)+1 and 
              max_{j+1..i} = min_{j+1..i} + (i - j - 1)   [which is automatically satisfied if the segment is contiguous? Actually, we have the min and the length, then the max must be min + (i-j-1) if the segment is contiguous? But we also have to check that the segment is contiguous. However, we don't know the max? We can compute min and max quickly? 

      Alternatively, we can use a condition: the segment [j+1, i] is contiguous if and only if the number of distinct elements is (i-j) and the max-min+1 = i-j. But we are in a permutation, so distinct is automatic.

      Therefore, condition: max_{j+1..i} - min_{j+1..i} + 1 == (i - j) and min_{j+1..i} = G(j)+1.

      Then we can do:

          F(0)=0, G(0)=0.

          For i from 1 to N:
            F(i) = 0
            For j from i-1 down to 0: 
                if we can compute the min and max of [j+1,i] and check the condition, then F(i) = max(F(i), F(j)+1) and set G(i)=max_{j+1..i}

          Then F(N) is the answer.

      But this is O(N^2).

      We need a more efficient solution.

      Alternatively, we note that the greedy algorithm we described earlier is O(N). But we have to handle swaps.

      How does a swap affect the greedy segmentation? The greedy segmentation is sequential and depends on the entire array. A swap of two elements might break the contiguous segments.

      We note that the greedy segmentation is deterministic: we break at the first possible position, then reset, and then break again, etc. Therefore, the breaks are at fixed positions.

      How can we update the breaks quickly when we swap two elements?

      Observing: the greedy algorithm is sequential. The breaks are defined by:

          Let B_0 = 0, and then B_1, B_2, ... B_k = N.

          Then for each segment i: the segment from B_{i-1}+1 to B_i has min = L_i and max = L_i + (B_i - B_{i-1} - 1) and the set is contiguous.

      And L_1=1, L_2 = max_1+1, etc.

      The entire segmentation is fixed.

      How does a swap affect? It might break one or more segments. Specifically, the swap might change the min and max of the segments that the swapped elements belong to. Then the segment might not be contiguous anymore, and then the breaks after that segment might be affected.

      Therefore, we need to:

        - Identify the segments that contain the two swapped positions. (If the two positions are in the same segment, then only one segment is affected; otherwise, two segments are affected.)

        - Recompute the segment(s) that contain the swapped positions? But note: the greedy segmentation is sequential: if one segment changes, then the entire subsequent segmentation might change? Because the L for the next segment is the max of the previous segment plus 1.

      Therefore, we have to recompute the segmentation from the start of the segment that contains the first swapped element to the end of the array? 

      But worst-case, we might have to recompute the entire array from that segment to the end. And if the swap is near the beginning, that is O(N) per swap -> total O(M*N) which is too slow.

      We need a more efficient method.

      Idea: use a segment tree to quickly compute the min, max, and also to quickly check the condition for a contiguous segment? But the greedy algorithm is sequential. We cannot easily parallelize it.

      Alternatively, we can note that the greedy segmentation is entirely determined by the positions of the numbers 1,2,...,N. Specifically, the segmentation is fixed by the positions of the integers.

      How? 

          The first segment must start at the position of 1? Not exactly: the first segment must include 1, but it might start before 1.

      However, note: the greedy algorithm starts at index 1 and extends until the current segment is contiguous and starts at 1. The segment must include the number 1 and also the numbers 2,3,...,k for k = max of the segment.

      Therefore, the segment ends at the maximum index that contains a number in [1, k] where k is the smallest integer such that the set {1,2,...,k} is contained in the segment and the segment has exactly k consecutive integers? 

      Actually, the greedy condition: we break at the first index i such that the min of the segment is 1 (so 1 is in the segment) and the max is k and the number of elements is k? But the number of elements is the length of the segment, and k = max, and the segment must be contiguous. Therefore, the segment must contain exactly the numbers [1, k]. And we break at the last occurrence of k? 

      Actually, we break at the first index i such that the set of numbers in the segment [1..i] is exactly [1, k] for k = max(segment). But note: the condition max-min+1 = length -> then k = max, and min=1, then k = length. Therefore, the segment must contain exactly the numbers [1, k] and the length is k.

      Therefore, the segment ends at the first index i such that the maximum element in [1..i] equals the number of distinct elements in [1..i]? Actually, the number of distinct elements is the length? But we have a permutation. Actually, the segment [1..i] has distinct elements. The condition is: max(segment) = i? (because the length is i) and min(segment)=1? 

      But wait: the segment might not start at index 1? Actually, the greedy algorithm starts at the last break. But the first segment starts at index 1. So for the first segment: we require that the set of numbers in [1..i] is [1, i]? 

      Actually, the condition: min([1..i])=1, max([1..i])=i, and the length is i -> then the set of numbers must be [1..i]. Therefore, the condition is that the maximum element is i? and the minimum is 1? 

      However, note: the array is a permutation. Therefore, the set [1..i] must appear in the prefix [1..i]. The condition for the prefix to be [1..i] is that the maximum element is i? and the minimum is 1? 

      But consider: [1,3,2] -> 
          i=1: max=1, min=1 -> but we need min=1 and max=1? then condition: 1-1+1=1 which equals the length, so we break? But the set is {1} which is [1] -> breaks.
          i=2: [1,3] -> min=1, max=3, length=2 -> 3-1+1=3 !=2 -> not break.
          i=3: [1,3,2] -> min=1, max=3, length=3 -> 3-1+1=3 -> holds, so break.

      But the set is {1,2,3} which is [1..3]. And the condition is that the max is 3 and the length is 3? 

      Therefore, for the segment that starts at j and ends at i, the condition is:
          min = j_min, max = j_max, and j_max - j_min + 1 = (i - j + 1)   [and also j_min = L, the next expected]

      But for the first segment, L=1, so we require min=1 and then the condition becomes: max - 1 + 1 = (i - 1 + 1) -> max = i.

      Therefore, for the first segment, we break at the first i such that the maximum in [1..i] is i and the minimum is 1? 

      Then for the next segment, we start at i+1, and we require that the next segment [i+1, k] has min = i+1 and max = k? 

      So the condition for a segment starting at s is that the minimum in [s, t] is s_min = L (which is the next expected number) and the maximum in [s,t] is L + (t-s) and also the minimum is L? Then it is contiguous.

      But note: the next expected number L is the last segment's max + 1. And the last segment ended at s-1 and had max = s-1? wait, not exactly: the last segment ended at s-1, and it had max = M, so L = M+1.

      Therefore, the condition for the segment [s, t] is: 
          min = M+1
          max = M+1 + (t - s)
          and the set is contiguous? which is guaranteed by min and max and the length.

      And also, the entire segment [s,t] must contain exactly the numbers from M+1 to M+1+(t-s).

      Therefore, the break at t occurs when the maximum in [s, t] is exactly M+1 + (t-s) and the minimum is M+1.

      How to find the next break quickly? We can precompose for fixed s: we want the smallest t>=s such that:
          min(s..t) = L and max(s..t) = L + (t-s)

      where L = M+1 (known from the previous break).

      This is the greedy: we extend until we meet the condition.

      Therefore, the segmentation is completely determined by the following: 
          Let s_0=1, L_0=1.
          Then for k>=0:
             Let t_k = the smallest t>=s_k such that:
                 min(s_k..t_k) = L_k and max(s_k..t_k) = L_k + (t_k - s_k)

             Then the next break is at t_k, and then s_{k+1}=t_k+1, L_{k+1}=L_k + (t_k - s_k + 1)

      And the number of segments is the number of breaks.

      How to compute t_k quickly? We can do a two pointers? But we have swaps.

      Alternatively, we can use a data structure that maintains the entire array and allows us to compute the segmentation. 

      We need to support:
          - Swapping two elements.
          - Querying the segmentation.

      However, the segmentation is sequential and depends on the entire array from s_k to the end.

      We might consider offline methods? But M up to 500,000.

      Insight: the condition for a break at t for a segment starting at s with expected minimum L is:
          Let X = L + (t - s)
          Then we require:
             min(s..t) = L
             max(s..t) = X

      And also, the entire set of numbers from L to X must be in the segment [s..t]. Since the array is a permutation, the condition min(s..t)=L and max(s..t)=X is equivalent to the segment containing exactly the numbers [L, X] (because if it contains an extra number, then either the min would be less than L or the max greater than X, but we have min=L and max=X, and distinct numbers, so the set must be [L,X]).

      Therefore, the condition is also equivalent to the set of numbers in [s..t] is [L, X] and the length is (X-L+1)= (t-s+1) -> which is always true if the set is [L,X] and the length is (X-L+1).

      Therefore, the condition reduces to: 
          min(s..t) = L and max(s..t) = L + (t-s)

      But note: if the set is [L, X] and the length is (X-L+1), then min=L and max=X. So it is sufficient to check min and max.

      How to find the next break quickly? 
          We have s and L. We wish to find the smallest t>=s such that:
             min(s..t) = L and max(s..t) = L + (t-s)

      We can rewrite the second condition: max(s..t) = L + (t-s) = (L+s) + t - 2*s? Actually: L + (t-s) = t + (L - s)

      Let F(t) = max(s..t) - t = (L - s)   [constant for fixed s and L]

      and also min(s..t) = L.

      Therefore, we can use a segment tree that for each t stores:
          min_range(s..t) and max_range(s..t) - t   [but s is fixed]

      However, s changes for each segment.

      Alternatively, we can sweep t from s upward and maintain the min and max of [s..t]. This is O(N) per segment, and there are O(N) segments? The number of segments is at most N. So total O(N^2) for the entire array.

      But we have to do it after every swap? That is too slow.

      We need to dynamically maintain the greedy segmentation as we swap.

      Another idea: the segmentation is determined by the positions of the minima and maxima. In particular, the breaks occur at the positions of the maxima? 

      Specifically, for a segment starting at s with expected minimum L, the break happens at t = s + (M - L) where M is the maximum in the segment? But we don't know M in advance.

      But note: the condition is that the maximum in the segment is L + (t-s). Therefore, if we let M = max(s..t), then t = s + (M - L).

      Therefore, we require that the maximum in the segment [s, s + (M - L)] is M and the minimum is L.

      Moreover, the number of elements is (M - L + 1).

      How to compute M? We wish to know: what is the maximum in the segment [s, s + (M - L)]? But M is the maximum, so we are in a loop.

      Alternatively, let r = s + (M - L) and M = max(s..r). Then we have:
          r = s + (M - L)  => M = L + (r - s)

      So if we let r be the position where the maximum in the segment starting at s is achieved, then we require that the maximum value M is exactly L + (r - s), and also the minimum in [s..r] is L.

      Also, we require that the entire segment [s..r] has no number outside [L, M] and exactly has the numbers [L, M]? 

      Therefore, the break will happen at r. But note: the break might happen later? 

      Consider: [1, 3, 2] -> 
          s=1, L=1.
          The maximum at s=1 is 1, then r = 1 + (1-1)=1 -> then we break at 1? 
          But then the next segment [2..3] has L=2. 
          In the next segment: 
             s=2, L=2.
             The maximum at s=2 is 3, then r = 2 + (3-2)=3 -> so break at 3.

          Then we have two segments: [1] and [3,2] -> but this is valid.

      However, in the sample we broke at 3 for the first segment? But here we broke at 1 and then at 3. Total segments=2? But the sample broke at 1, then at 2 (for the segment [3,2] at index 3? wait, no: [3,2] is at indices 2 and 3, so break at index 3).

      So it is the same.

      Therefore, we can compute the next break as follows:

          Let r0 = s.
          Let M = the maximum in [s..r0] -> initially A[s]
          Then let r = s + (M - L)   [because M = L + (r - s) => r = s + (M - L)]
          Then we check the segment [s, r]:
             If the minimum in [s, r] is L and the maximum in [s, r] is M, then we break at r.
          Otherwise, we cannot break at r? 

      But what if there is a number greater than M in [s, r]? Then the maximum would change. 

      Therefore, we must ensure that the maximum in [s, r] is exactly M. If not, then we update M to be the actual maximum in [s, r] and then recompute r = s + (M - L), and then extend to new r, and check again.

      This is similar to the method for "next greater element" and might be O(N) per segment.

      Example: 
          s=1, L=1.
          r0 = 1: M = A[1]=1, then r = 1 + (1-1)=1.
          Check [1,1]: min=1, max=1 -> valid, break.

          Then next segment: s=2, L=2.
          r0=2: M=A[2]=3, then r = 2+(3-2)=3.
          Check [2,3]: min=min(3,2)=2, max=3 -> valid, break.

      Another example: [2,1,4,3]
          s=1, L=1.
          We start at 1: M=A[1]=2, then r = 1+(2-1)=2.
          Now check [1,2]: min=min(2,1)=1, max=2 -> valid, break. 
          Then next segment: s=3, L=3.
          M=A[3]=4, r = 3+(4-3)=4.
          Check [3,4]: min=min(4,3)=3, max=4 -> valid, break.

      This matches.

      Algorithm for a fixed array: 
        s = 1
        L = 1
        count = 0
        while s <= N:
            count += 1
            M = A[s]
            r = s + (M - L)
            if r > N: then break out? and then the segment is [s..N] and then break? but then we have to check if it is contiguous? 
            Let current_min = A[s], current_max = A[s]
            But we need the min and max in [s, r]. We can do a loop from s to r to compute the actual min and max.

            However, then we update: 
               actual_max = max( current_max, the maximum in [s+1, r] ) 
               similarly for min.

            But then if the actual_max > M, then we do: 
               M = actual_max
               r = s + (M - L)   [which is larger]

            And then extend the range to new r, and update the min and max for the new elements from the old r+1 to new r.

            We iterate until the range [s, r] has max = M and the min is L.

            Then we set:
               s = r+1
               L = M+1

        The answer is count.

      This is the greedy but with a range extension. In the worst-case, this might be O(N) per segment, and O(N) segments, so O(N^2). But note: the entire array is scanned once, because when we extend we only scan new elements. Actually, the total work is O(N) for the entire array. Why? 

          In the entire algorithm, each position is visited at most once as we extend the segment. 

          However, consider: 
              We start at s, and we set r = s + (M0 - L) for M0 = A[s].
              Then we scan from s to r, and we might find a new max M1 > M0, then we set r' = s + (M1 - L) > r, and then scan from r+1 to r', and then might find a new max M2, and so on.

          In the worst-case, if the array is decreasing, then we might extend many times, but the total work is the sum of the lengths of these extensions. And the final r is at least the previous r, and the entire array is scanned once.

      Therefore, the entire algorithm for one segmentation is O(N).

      But we have M swaps, and after each swap we must recompute the segmentation. And if we do this, it is O(N) per swap, total O(N*M) = 25e10, which is too slow.

      Therefore, we need a data structure to speed up the greedy segmentation with range extension. 

      Specifically, we wish to:

        Given s and L, compute the next break r by repeatedly:
           r0 = s + (M - L)  [where M is the current maximum in [s, current_r], initially current_r=s]
           then extend to r0, update M to the maximum in [s, r0], and then set r1 = s + (newM - L), and so on.

        We wish to do this without scanning the entire segment.

      We can use a segment tree that can answer range min and range max quickly. Then we can avoid scanning by doing a binary search? But the extension is defined by the maximum we find in the current interval.

      Alternatively, we can do a while loop:

        current_r = s-1
        M = -inf, m = inf
        while true:
            next_r = s + (M - L)   [but initially M is not set?]
            Actually, we start with current_r = s-1, then we set next_r = s + (max_so_far - L) but if we have not seen any element, then we start at s.

        Instead, we start by next_r = s + (A[s] - L)  [because initially M = A[s]].

        Then we query the segment tree for the min and max in [s, next_r]. 
        Let new_min = min in [s, next_r]
        Let new_max = max in [s, next_r]
        Then we set next_r = s + (new_max - L)

        If next_r is the same as the previous next_r, then we are done: 
            if new_min == L and new_max == L + (next_r - s) then break.
        Otherwise, we extend the query to the new next_r and update new_min and new_max by including the new indices.

      How many times do we extend? In the worst-case, it might be O(N) per segment, but the entire work over the whole array is O(N) because each index is added at most once to a segment's consideration. 

      But note: in one segmentation (for one fixed array) the total work is O(N). However, after a swap, the entire segmentation might change, and we might have to recompute the entire array segmentation.

      Therefore, the work per swap is O(N), and total O(M*N) = 25e10.

      Given the constraints (500,000) this is 25e10 operations, which is 250 seconds in C++, too slow.

      Therefore, we must look for a different approach.

      Insight: the condition for a break at position i is independent of the future and past? Actually, no, because the next expected L depends on the previous segments. But we note that the segmentation is greedy and sequential, and a swap in one segment might only affect that segment and the following segments.

      Specifically, if we swap two elements in segment k, then segment k might change, and then the following segments might change because the next expected L might change.

      Therefore, we have to recompute from the start of the segment that contains the swap to the end.

      How to identify the segment that contains a given position? We can maintain an array seg[] that records for each position i, the segment id that contains i. 

      How to update after a swap? 
          Let the two positions be i and j.
          Find the segments that contain i and j. 
          Recompute the segmentation starting from the earliest segment that contains i or j.

      But if we recompute from there, how many segments might be affected? In the worst-case, the entire rest of the array, so O(N) per swap, and total O(N*M)=25e10.

      However, note: the sum of the number of segments that are recomputed might be bounded by the total number of segments touched? But worst-case, each swap could force a recomputation of the entire array.

      Given M=500,000 and N=500,000, 500,000 * 500,000 = 250e9 which is 250 seconds in C++ which is borderline in Pyton but in C++ might be acceptable if optimized? But the problem has 2 seconds per test in C++? Actually, the time limit is 2.0 seconds for the entire run.

      Therefore, we need a faster solution.

      Another approach: online interval expansion with a union-find or with a stack? 

      Alternatively, we can note that the segmentation is completely determined by the values of the array and can be characterized by the following: 

          The segmentation is the unique partition into contiguous segments such that for each break at i, the set of the prefix [1..i] is exactly [1, i] in the first segment, and in general the set of the segment [s..i] is [L, L+ (i-s)].

      And the number of segments is the number of times the maximum prefix equals the current index.

      Specifically, in the first segment: we break when the maximum so far is equal to the current index. 
          Let P_i = the maximum in the prefix [1..i]. 
          Then the first break happens at the first i such that P_i = i.

      Then the next segment: 
          We reset, and then we are only interested in the numbers >= i+1. 
          Let Q_i = the minimum in the suffix starting at i+1? 

      Actually, for the second segment, the expected minimum is i+1. 
          Let R_i = the maximum in the segment from s to i (relative to the new start) minus the start value? 

      Alternatively, we can define an array B of length N, where B_i = i - A_i + 1? 

      Known fact: the number of segments is the number of 
          so-called "record" in the sequence of prefix maxima, but adjusted for the reset.

      Specifically, the greedy segmentation is equivalent to the number of prefix minima in the sequence of the inverse permutation? 

      Let's define the inverse permutation: Let pos[x] = the position of x in the array.

      Then the condition for the first break at i is that the maximum in the prefix [1..i] is i and the minimum in the prefix is 1. 
          -> then the set of numbers in the prefix is [1..i]. 

      Then the condition for the first break is that the maximum in the prefix is i.

      How about the second break? 
          The second segment must contain the next expected number L = i+1. 
          And the break happens at the smallest j>=i+1 such that the maximum in [i+1..j] is j - i + (i+1) - 1 = j - i + i+1 -1 = j? 

          -> the maximum in [i+1..j] is j.

      Therefore, the break points are exactly the positions i such that the maximum in the prefix ending at i is exactly i.

      But wait: 
          In the first segment: break at i if the maximum in [1..i] is i.
          In the second segment: break at j if the maximum in [i+1..j] is j.
          In the third segment: break at k if the maxima in [j+1..k] is k.

      Therefore, the break points are the positions i such that the maximum in the prefix ending at i is i.

      How to see this? 
          The maximum in the entire array up to i must be i, and it must appear at i.

      Actually, not necessarily at i: consider [1,3,2]: 
          break at i=3: but the maximum in [1..3] is 3, and it appears at position 2, not 3.

      Therefore, the condition is not that the element at i is i, but that the maximum in [1..i] is i.

      So the break points are the positions i such that the prefix maximum at i is i.

      Then the number of break points is the number of i in [1..N] such that the prefix maximum at i is i.

      And the number of segments is the number of break points, because each break point ends a segment.

      Therefore, the answer is the number of i in [1..N] such that the prefix maximum at i is i.

      Let's validate with the sample: 
          Sample 1: [3,1,2,5,4,6]
             i=1: prefix max=3 -> not 1 -> not break
             i=2: prefix max=3 -> not 2
             i=3: prefix max=3 -> not 3
             i=4: prefix max=5 -> not 4
             i=5: prefix max=5 -> not 5
             i=6: prefix max=6 -> break
          -> only one break? but the sample output is 3.

      This is not matching.

      Let me do the segmentation for [3,1,2,5,4,6]:
          Segment 1: [3,1,2] -> because min=1, max=3, and length=3 -> contiguous. 
          Segment 2: [5,4] -> min=4, max=5, length=2 -> contiguous.
          Segment 3: [6] -> min=6, max=6, length=1 -> contiguous.
          breaks at positions 3 and 5 and 6.

      But using the condition: 
          We expect break at i if the prefix maximum at i is i.
          i=3: prefix max=3 -> break.
          i=5: prefix max=5 -> break.
          i=6: prefix max=6 -> break.

      Therefore, there are three breaks.

      How to compute the prefix maximum for the entire array? 
          The prefix maximum for the entire array: 
             i=1: max=3
             i=2: max=3
             i=3: max=3 -> and then at i=3, we have max=3 and i=3, so break.
          then for the next segment, we start at i=4: 
             consider only from 4 onward, but note: the array is not values in [4..6] only? 

      However, the condition for the break in the second segment: 
          We want the break at j=5 because in the second segment (positions 4 and 5) the maximum is 5, and the index within the segment: 
             position 4: value=5 -> max=5, and the segment index (which is the absolute index? or the offset within the segment) is 1 (because we are at the first element of the segment) -> not 5.
          within the segment, the condition is that the maximum in the prefix of the segment is equal to the length of the segment from the start of the segment to that position.

      Therefore, we cannot use the absolute index i, but the relative index within the segment.

      Alternatively, we can reindex the array for the entire run? 

      But note: the condition for a break in the first segment is that the prefix maximum (in the entire array) at i is the value i (absolute value) and also the value i must be in the prefix.

      for the second segment, the condition is that the prefix maximum within the entire array at i is i, but wait: in the second segment, the values are in [4..6], and the break happens at i=5 because the maximum in the entire array up to i=5 is 5? 
          prefix max at i=5: [3,1,2,5,4] -> max=5, and 5==5 -> break.

      and at i=6: max=6, break.

      Therefore, the breaks are at i=3, i=5, i=6.

      So the number of segments is the number of i such that the prefix maximum up to i is i.

      Then the answer is the count of i in [1..N] with the property: 
          max_{1..i} = i

      But note: i is the index, and the value we are taking max over is the array values.

      Therefore, we have an array A[1..N] (permutation), and we want to count the number of i such that 
          max_{1<=j<=i} A[j] = i

      But wait: the value at i might be not i. Example i=3: the condition is that the maximum in [1..3] is 3. In the sample [3,1,2,5,4,6]: 
          i=3: the maximum in [1..3] is 3 -> true.
          i=5: the maximum in [1..5] is 5 -> true.
          i=6: the maximum in [1..6] is 6 -> true.
          i=1: max=3 (which is not 1) -> false.
          i=2: max=3 (not 2) -> false.
          i=4: max=5 (not 4) -> false.

      Therefore, count=3.

      Sample 2: [3,1,2,5,4,6] -> answer=3.

      Sample input 1: first output is 3.

      Check Sample input 2: 
          "10 8
          1 4 3 2 5 6 7 10 9 8"
          without any swap, the answer is 6.

          Let's compute the prefix maxima:
             i=1: A[1]=1 -> max=1, and 1==1 -> break.
             i=2: A[2]=4 -> max=4, 4!=2 -> not break.
             i=3: A[3]=3 -> max=4, not 3.
             i=4: A[4]=2 -> max=4, not 4.
             i=5: A[5]=5 -> max=5, 5==5 -> break.
             i=6: A[6]=6 -> break.
             i=7: A[7]=7 -> break.
             i=8: A[8]=10 -> max=10, not 8.
             i=9: A[9]=9 -> max=10, not 9.
             i=10: A[10]=8 -> max=10, 10==10 -> break.

          breaks at i=1,5,6,7,10 -> count=5, but the sample says 6.

      What is the segmentation for Sample input 2?
          [1] -> break at 1.
          [4,3,2] -> 
              min=2, max=4, length=3 -> 4-2+1=4, which is not 3? -> so not contiguous? 
          Wait, the array is [1,4,3,2,5,6,7,10,9,8]

          Segment 1: [1] -> valid.
          Segment 2: [4,3,2] -> min=2, max=4, length=3 -> 4-2+1=4 !=3 -> invalid.

          This suggests our condition using prefix maxima = i is not the whole story.

      Let me do the segmentation manually for [1,4,3,2,5,6,7,10,9,8]:
          First segment: must start at 1. 
             [1] -> min=1, max=1, length=1 -> 1-1+1=1 -> valid. Break at 1. 
             L = 2.
          Second segment: [4,3,2] 
             min=2, max=4, length=3 -> 4-2+1=3 -> and we require min=L=2 -> valid. Break at 3 (index 4 in 1-indexed? -> the segment is indices 2..4) 
             then L=5.
          Third segment: [5] -> valid. Break at index 5.
          Fourth segment: [6] -> valid. Break at index 6.
          Fifth segment: [7] -> valid. Break at index 7.
          Sixth segment: [10,9,8] -> min=8, max=10, length=3 -> 10-8+1=3 -> valid and min=8, and we are expecting L= next=8 -> valid. Break at index 10.

          Therefore, breaks at indices: 1,4,5,6,7,10 -> 6 segments.

      Now, in terms of the global prefix maxima? 
          We need the break points to be at positions where the condition for the entire array up to that point is that the maximum is the value of the break (not the index) ??? 

      Let's see the break at index 1: 
          condition: the maximum in [1..1] = A[1]=1, and the break condition is that the value of the maximum should be the index? 1==1 -> break.

      break at index 4: 
          the entire array up to index 4: [1,4,3,2] -> the maximum is 4, and the index is 4 -> break. 

      break at index 5: 
          prefix to 5: [1,4,3,2,5] -> maximum=5 -> break.

      break at index 6: 
          prefix to 6: maximum=6 -> break.

      break at index 7: 
          prefix to 7: maximum=7 -> break.

      break at index 10: 
          prefix to 10: maximum=10 -> break.

      Therefore, the breaks are at indices i where the prefix maximum is i.

      In Sample input 2: 
          i=1: max=1 -> break.
          i=2: max=4 -> 4!=2 -> not break.
          i=3: max=4 -> not 3.
          i=4: max=4 -> 4==4 -> break.
          i=5: max=5 -> break.
          i=6: max=6 -> break.
          i=7: max=7 -> break.
          i=8: max=10 -> not 8.
          i=9: max=10 -> not 9.
          i=10: max=10 -> break.

      So we have breaks at i=1,4,5,6,7,10 -> count=6.

      Therefore, the condition is: 
          The number of segments is the number of indices i (1<=i<=N) such that the prefix maximum at i is equal to the value i.

      Note: the value of the prefix maximum at i is the maximum value in the array from 1 to i, and we compare that value to the index i.

      Why is that? 
          In the first break: we require the maximum in the prefix to be the value that is the first segment's max, and the segment must end at i with the segment's max = i. 
          In the example, the first segment ends at i=1, and the max=1, and 1=1.
          The second segment (indices 2..4) -> the entire array up to 4 has max=4, and we break at i=4.

      Therefore, the answer for the initial array is the number of i in [1..N] such that the prefix maximum at i is i.

      And for the swaps, we are swapping two elements in the array. This might change the prefix maxima for indices from min(i,j) to ??? 
          The prefix maximum might change for indices >= the swap positions.

      Specifically, if we swap A[i] and A[j] (with i<j), then the prefix maxima might change for indices from i to j-1 and then from j onward? 
          Actually, from the minimum of the two indices to the end? 
          Let's say i<j. 
          The swap might affect the prefix maxima for indices >=i.

      Therefore, for each swap, we need to:
          - Let i<j.
          - Swap A[i] and A[j].
          - Recompute the prefix maxima for indices from i to N.
          - Count the number of indices k in [i, N] such that the prefix maximum at k is k.

      But how to recompute the prefix maxima quickly? 
          The prefix maxima: 
             P[1] = A[1]
             for k from 2 to N: P[k] = max(P[k-1], A[k])

          This is O(N) per swap.

      Total O(M*N) = 25e10.

      However, note: the prefix maxima is a monotonic sequence. When we swap two elements, the change is local. Specifically, the prefix maxima from 1 to i-1 is unchanged. 
          Let x = min(i,j), y = max(i,j).
          Then for k in [x, y-1]: the prefix maxima might change only if the new A[x] is greater than the old one, or if the chain of maxima is broken.
          But then from y onward, the prefix maxima might also change.

      We can use a segment tree or a Fenwick tree for range maxima, but the prefix maxima is sequential.

      Alternatively, we can use a balanced BST or a skip list, but we need to update the entire tail.

      Another idea: use a segment tree to recompute the prefix maxima quickly? 

          The prefix maxima is defined sequentially, so it is not clear.

      Alternatively, we can maintain the entire array of A and update the prefix maxima in a Fenway tree? 

          We can maintain the prefix maxima array in a Fenwick tree? 

      But note: we only care about the indices where the prefix maxima equals the index. 

      We can maintain a Fenwick tree that counts the number of indices that currently have the property: prefix_max[i] = i.

      And when we swap A[i] and A[j], we need to update the prefix maxima for indices from min(i,j) to N. 

      Then we also update the Fenwick tree for the indices in [min(i,j), N] that are affected: for each index in this range, we recompute the prefix maxima and then if it now  equals the index, we add it, and if it previously was counted and now is not, we remove it.

      But this is O(N) per swap.

      Therefore, we need a data structure to update the prefix maxima and the count quickly.

      How to update the prefix maxima in O(log n) per swap? 

          We note that the prefix maxima is: 
             P[1] = A[1]
             P[i] = max(P[i-1], A[i])

          This is sequential. When we change A[i] for some i, then the effect is: 
             The prefix maxima from i to the next index where the prefix maxima is greater than or equal to the new value might be updated.

          Specifically, after a at index i, the new prefix maxima at i is newP = max(P[i-1], new_value).
          Then for i+1: newP[i+1] = max(newP[i], A[i+1]), and so on.

          The change might propagate until we hit an index where the prefix maxima is >= the new value.

          In the worst-case, it might propagate to the end.

      Therefore, we cannot do better than O(N) per swap in the worst-case.

      Given the constraints (N, M<=500,000) and the worst-case where each swap propagates to the end, the total time would be O(M*N) = 25e10, which is 250 seconds in C++.

      But the problem memory is 1024 MB, and we are in C++.

      However, the time limit is 2.0 seconds.

      Therefore, we must hope that the swaps are not adversarial. 

      But the problem does not specify, so we must assume the worst-case.

      Alternatively, we can use a balanced BST that stores the current values, and then for prefix maxima, we can use a segment tree for range maxima and then use binary search to find the next index where the value is greater than a given threshold? 

          For a swap at i and j (i<j), 
             Let's assume we are setting A[i] = new_i, A[j] = new_j.
             We need to update the prefix maxima from i to N.

             Steps for updating from i onward:

                 Let current = (i==1 ? 0 : P[i-1])
                 For k from i to N:
                     P[k] = max(current, A[k])
                     then current = P[k]

                 But this is O(N).

          Instead, we can use a segment tree for range maxima to accelerate the recomputation of the prefix maxima from i onward. 
             We wish to find the next index after i where the value is greater than the current prefix maxima at i (which is the new value at i or the prefix[i-1] if it is greater). 

             Then the prefix maxima will be the same as before until that index, and then at that index, we update.

          Specifically, let from_index = i.
          Let current_max = (i==1 ? 0 : prefix_max[i-1])
          Then the new prefix_max[i] = new_i = max(current_max, A[i] (new value))

          Then we find the next index j>i such that A[j] > current_max (using the segment tree for range maxima). 
             Then in the range [i, j-1], the prefix maxima is constant = new_i.
             At j, the prefix maxima = A[j] (new value) if it is greater than new_i, but new_i might be updated from a swap.

          Actually, the new value at i might be very small, then the prefix maxima from i to j-1 might be current_max (which is not changed).

          Therefore, the change might be limited.

      In summary, the solution is:

          We maintain:
             an array A for the current values.
             an array P for the prefix maxima (optional, but we will have to answer for each index i whether P[i]==i)

          And a Fenwick tree or segment tree that stores the condition (P[i]==i) as 1 if true else 0, and we can query the sum.

          Also, we maintain a segment tree for range maxima to accelerate the recomputation of the prefix maxima and the propagation.

          For a swap between positions i and j (i<j):

             // First, swap the values A[i] and A[j]
             // Second, update the prefix maxima from min(i,j) to N.

             // We will update from x = min(i,j) to N.

             // But note: the prefix maxima from 1 to x-1 is unchanged.

             // We will simulate the prefix maxima from x onward, but we use a segment tree to jump.

             steps for updating from x to N:

                 Let current = (x==1 ? 0 : P[x-1])
                 // We will update from x to N in chunks:

                 while x <= N:
                    // Find the next index y in [x, N] such that A[y] > current.
                    // In the range [x, y-1], the prefix maxima is current.
                    // But wait: if there is an index in [x, y-1] with a value > current, then we would have found a y in between.

                    // So we find the first index y>=x such that A[y] > current.

                    If not found, then for all k in [x, N]: P[k] = current.
                       // Then we update the condition for these indices: for each k in [x, N], we set condition to 0 (because current might not be>=k? and if current<k, then condition becomes (current==k) which is false.
                       // But note: current might be less than x, then certainly for k>=x, current<k, so condition is false.
                       // So we can mark the entire range [x, N] as not meeting the condition.
                       // But we had some values there before, so we must update.

                    If found, then:
                       // In the range [x, y-1]: the maxima is current, so P[k]=current for k in [x, y-1].
                       // Then at y, P[y] = A[y] (new value) because A[y] > current.
                       // But note: the value at y might have changed in the swap.

                       // Then we set current = A[y]
                       // and then we move x = y+1.

                 However, this is still O(N) in the worst-case.

      Given the complexity, and the constraints, we must use a method that is output-sensitive. 

      Specifically, the number of indices where the prefix maxima changes might be limited. 
          In the best-case, only a few indices change.

      But in the worst-case, the entire suffix might change.

      Therefore, we can simply recompute the prefix maxima from i to N and also update the count of the condition. 
          We maintain a global array for the current condition: is_break[i] = 1 if (P[i]==i) else 0.
          And a global count = sum(is_break)

          For the update:

             // Remember the old values of is_break for the range [i, N] before the swap.
             // Remove them from count.

             // Swap A[i] and A[j] (i<j, so let i = min, j = max).

             // Recompute the prefix maxima from i to N:

                 P[i] = max( (i>1 ? P[i-1] : 0), A[i])
                 for k from i+1 to N:
                     P[k] = max(P[k-1], A[k])

             // Then for k from i to N:
                 new_break = (P[k]==k) ? 1 : 0
                 // add new_break to count, and also remember to remove the old break count for these positions.

             But we don't have the old break count for after the swap? 
                 We can do: 
                     count = count - (number of breaks in [i, N] in the old state) + (number of breaks in [i, N] in the new state)

             How to get the old state? We can save the old prefix maxima and old condition for [i, N] before the swap.

          This is O(N) per swap.

      Given that M and N are 500,000, and in the worst-case we do 500,000*(500,000) = 250e9 iterations, which is not feasible.

      Therefore, we must hope that in practice the changes are local.

      But the problem does not specify, so we must assume the worst-case.

      However, note: the 
          Sample input 1: 6,5 
          Sample input 2: 10,8

      and the sample swaps are provided.

      Maybe in practice it is not adversarial.

      Given the complexity, and the fact that we have to output an editorial not code, we might as well describe the O(N) per swap method.

      Given the time constraints, we decide to do the following in the editorial:

        The solution is to use the insight: the number of segments is the number of indices i such that the prefix maxima at i is i.

        For the initial array, we can compute this in O(N).

        For each swap, we do:

           Let x = min(U_i, V_i), y = max(U_i, V_i)

           // backup the current values of A[x] and A[y], and also the current prefix maxima from x to y and the break conditions in [x, N] 
           // Actually, we only need to backup the break conditions in [x, N] if we are to. 

           // Swap A[x] and A[y]

           // Recompute the prefix maxima from x to N, and also update the break condition for indices from x to N.

           // To do so, 
                if x==1, then current = 0, else current = P[x-1]
                for i from x to N:
                    P[i] = max(current, A[i])
                    current = P[i]
                    // and then update the break count: 
                         if the new break condition at i is different from the old one (which we backup up for this swap), then update the global count.

           // However, we didn't backup the entire break condition for [x, N] from the current state, we only know the global count. 

           // Instead, we can do:

                // Let old_count_segment = the number of breaks in [x, N] in the old state.
                // We can precompute this by having a Fenwick tree for the break conditions. Then we do:
                   // before swap, we do a query from x to N to get the old_count_segment.
                // Then after recomputing, we compute new_count_segment = the number of breaks in [x, N] in the new state.
                // Then the new global count = global_count - old_count_segment + new_count_segment.

           // How to compute old_count_segment quickly? We can maintain a Fenwick tree that can do range sum on the break conditions.

          Steps for a swap:

             Step 1: 
                 Let x = min(U_i, V_i), y = max(U_i, V_i)
                 // Backup the current values of A[x] and A[y]

             Step 2: 
                 // Query the current break conditions in the range [x, N] (using a Fenwick tree or segment tree) -> let this be old_count_segment.

             Step 3: 
                 // Remove the break conditions in the range [x, N] from the Fenwick tree? or simply we will recomute the new break conditions for [x, N] and then update the Fenwick tree for the new ones.

                 // We are going to recompute the prefix maxima for [x, N] and also the break conditions.

                 // We will create a temporary array for the new break conditions in [x, N] and also update the global array for P and break condition.

                 // Specifically, 
                      // Swap A[x] and A[y]
                      // Recompute the prefix maxima from x to N: 
                         current = (x==1 ? 0 : P[x-1])   // note: the prefix up to x-1 is unchanged.
                         For i from x to N:
                             current = max(current, A[i])
                             P[i] = current
                             new_break_i = (current==i) ? 1 : 0

                 // Then we also need to update the Fenwick tree: 
                      // For i from x to N, we will:
                             // if the break condition at i changed from the old to new, then update the Fenwick tree: 
                             // Let old_break_i = the value before the swap (which we might have to backup in an array for the entire [x, N] for the break conditions) 
                             // But we didn't backup per index.

                 // Alternatively, we can do:
                      // We backup for [x, N] the old break conditions in an array of length (N-x+1) (which is O(N) per swap, and total O(M*N)=250e9 integers, which is 1e12 bytes, not feasible)

                 // Instead, we can simply do:

                      // We have a Fenwick tree that stores the break conditions. Before the swap, we set for i in [x, N]: 
                         // Fenw_tree: set break condition to 0 for now (remove them).
                      // Then after recomputing, we set for i in [x, N] the new break condition.

                 // But then how to get old_count_segment? We queried it already.

                 // And then the new_count_segment = the number of i in [x, N] with new_break_i=1.

                 // Then update the Fenwick tree for each i in [x, N]: 
                         if new_break_i==1, then add it in the Fenwick tree.

                 // Then the global count = global_count - old_count_segment + new_count_segment.

             This is O(N) per swap.

          Given the constraints, we cannot avoid O(N) per swap in the worst-case.

      Therefore, the solution as described might be acceptable in some languages for small inputs, but for N,M=500,000, it is 250 seconds in C++.

      However, note: the sample inputs are small. 
          Sample1: N=6, M=5 -> each swap does at most 6 steps, and 5*6 = 30.
          Sample2: N=10, M=8 -> 8*10=80.

      But the worst-case might be an adversary that swaps the last two elements repeatedly, and then the update for each swap is from near the beginning to the end.

      Specifically, if we swap the first element and the last element, then we have to recompute the prefix maxima for the entire array.

      And if we do that for 500,000 swaps, then 500,000 * 500,000 = 250e9, which in C++ might be:
          250e9 iterations, each iteration is a few operations, say 10 operations per iteration = 2.5e12 operations, which is not feasible in 2 seconds.

      Therefore, we must have a more efficient method.

      How to update the prefix maxima in O(1) amortized time? 

      We note that the prefix maxima is a left-to-right maxima if they appear in increasing order. 

      Specifically, the only indices that can be breaks are the indices that are left-to-right maxima (greater than all to the left).

      And among these, we only care if the value equals the index.

      Therefore, we maintain a data structure that stores the left-to-right maxima (along with their indices) in a linked list. 

      When we swap two elements, we might change the left-to-right maxima. 

      Specifically, the left-to-right maxima for indices>=min(i,j) might change.

      This is non-trivial.

 Given the complexity of the problem and the time constraints, and since this is an editorial, we might state:

      The intended solution is to 
        1. Realize that the answer is the number of indices i (1<=i<=N) such that the prefix maximum at i is i.
        2. For each swap, update the array and recompute the prefix maxima from min(i,j) to N, and update the count of the condition.

      And to hope that in practice the changes are local. If the changes are not local, then the solution might be too slow for the given constraints.

      However, we note that the condition might be ( amortized ) faster.

      Alternatively, there is a known solution using a segment tree that tract the condition and updates in O(log n) per swap, but it is very complex.

      Given the constraints in the problem (2 seconds and 1024 MB for N, M up to 500,000), the intended solution might use a data structure that can update the prefix maxima in O(\sqrt{N}) time, or using a priority queue, but we are not aware.

      Given the time, we output the solution with the O(N) per swap as the intended solution, and we note that it might be too slow for the worst-case.

      Or we might note that the condition (prefix maxima = i) is very sparse. In fact, there are at most O(N) such events in the entire array, and after a swap, only a few indices might change.

      Specifically, when we swap two elements, the only indices that might change in the prefix maxima are the indices between min(i,j) and the next left-to-right maxima, and so on.

      Therefore, the number of indices where the prefix maxima changes is only the indices from min(i,j) to the next maxima after the swap, and then we might have to update at most O(1) amortized per swap.

      But to the best of our knowledge, there is no known efficient algorithm for this.

      Therefore, we output the following for the editorial:

        The key observation is that the number of segments is the number of indices i such that the prefix maximum up to i is i.

        For the initial array, we can compute this in O(N) by and in the prefix maxima array.

        For each swap of elements at positions u and v (with u<=v for simplicity), we do the following:

          1. Swap the elements at positions u and v.
          2. Recompute the prefix maxima from u to N. Specifically, 
                if u > 1, let current = prefix_max[u-1], else current = 0.
                for i from u to N:
                    current = max(current, A[i])
                    prefix_max[i] = current
                    and set break_i = 1 if current==i else 0
          3. Count the number of break_i for i in [u, N] in the new state, and also we must account for the change in [u, N] in the break conditions.

          To do so, we maintain a global count of break conditions for the entire array. 

          Let old_count_u = the number of break conditions in the range [u, N] in the old state.
          (We can have a Fenwick tree or segment tree for the break conditions, and query [u, N] before the swap.)

          Let new_count_u = the number of break conditions in the range [u, N] in the new state.

          Then the new global count = (global_count - old_count_u + new_count_u).

          Then we update the Fenwick tree for the break conditions in the range [u, N]: 
               For i from u to N:
                   if the break condition changed, update the Fenwick tree (set to the new value).

          Note: in the old state, the break conditions in [u, N] are stored in the Fenwick tree. Before the swap, we set them to 0 for the purpose of the update? 

          Specifically, we can do:

               // Remove the break conditions in [u, N] from the Fenwick tree.
               for i in [u, N] in the old state: 
                   if break_i was 1, then update Fenw_tree: add -1 at i.

               // Then after recomputing, for i in [u, N]:
                   if new_break_i is 1, then update Fenw_tree: add +1 at i.

          But then we need the old break conditions for [u, N] per index. We can recompute them by the old prefix_max? We can save the old prefix_max for [u, N] in a backup array.

          However, the for-loop from u to N in the recomputation of the prefix maxima naturally gives us the new break conditions. 

          We can do:

             backup_old_break = an array of length 0 initially, but we can use the global break condition array for the old state.

          Steps for a swap (u, v) with u<=v:

             // backup the old break conditions for [u, N]: not the values, but we will do a query for the count and then update the Fenw tree per index later.
             // Instead, we do:

                 step1: query the Fenwick tree for range [u, N] to get old_count_u.

                 step2: swap A[u] and A[v].

                 step3: 
                     if u>1: current = prefix_max[u-1]   // which is unchanged
                     else: current = 0
                     // also, backup the old prefix_max for [u, N] if needed for the Fenw tree update? 
                     // We will recompute the new prefix_max for [u, N] and new break conditions.

                     new_count_u = 0
                     for i from u to N:
                         old_break_i = break_condition[i]   // the global array of break conditions (0/1) from before the swap
                         // that we are about to change.
                         current = max(current, A[i])
                         new_break_i = (current==i) ? 1 :0
                         break_condition[i] = new_break_i   // update the global array
                         // update the Fenwick tree: 
                             if old_break_i != new_break_i:
                                 if new_break_i==1: 
                                     add 1 to Fenw_tree at i
                                 else:
                                     add -1 to Fenw_tree at i

                         // and for counting new_count_u, we could do: new_count_u += new_break_i, but we are not 

                     // But wait, we can compute new_count_u = query [u, N] on the Fenw_tree after the update, or we can accumulate in the loop.

                 step4: // the global count is not needed explicitly, because the answer is the sum over [1, N] of break_condition, and we maintain it in the Fenw_tree.

                 // then the answer = query [1, N] from the Fenw_tree.

          This is still O(N) per swap.

      Therefore, the for-loop from u to N is the bottleneck.

      This solution is O(N*M) in the worst-case and might not be efficient enough for the given constraints. 

      However, note that in practice the changes in the prefix maxima might be local. The for-loop might only need to go until the first index where the new maxima is greater than or equal to the old maxima at that index. 

      Specifically, in the for-loop, we can break if the new prefix_max[i] equals the old prefix_max[i] and the new maxima is not affected by the change. 

      But the change in A[u] might cause a change in the prefix maxima that then might be

 We leave the editorial at this point, as the efficient solution is complex and might be beyond the scope.
