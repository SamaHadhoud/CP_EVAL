To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum trauma rating Edgar needs to reach at least level \( L \) by completing a subset of available quests. Each quest has a minimum level requirement, a level gain upon completion, and a trauma value. Edgar's trauma rating is defined as the sum of the \( K \) largest trauma values among the quests he completes. If he completes fewer than \( K \) quests, his trauma rating is the sum of all trauma values of the completed quests.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves selecting a subset of quests such that Edgar can achieve level \( L \) while minimizing the trauma rating. The constraints include:
   - Each quest can be completed only if Edgar's current level is at least the quest's minimum level requirement.
   - Each quest can be completed at most once.
   - The trauma rating is the sum of the \( K \) largest trauma values of the completed quests (or the sum of all if fewer than \( K \) quests are completed).

2. **Key Insight**: Given the constraints (especially the small values of \( N \) and trauma values), a dynamic programming (DP) approach is feasible. The DP state will track:
   - The number of quests completed.
   - The sum of the smallest \( \max(0, \text{quests\_completed} - K) \) trauma values (discarded trauma sum). This helps in computing the trauma rating as the total trauma sum minus this discarded sum.

3. **Algorithm Selection**:
   - **Sorting Quests**: Quests are sorted by their minimum level requirement to ensure we process them in an order that respects level prerequisites.
   - **DP State Initialization**: `dp[j][s]` represents the maximum level achievable with `j` quests completed and `s` being the sum of the discarded trauma values (smallest \( \max(0, j - K) \) values).
   - **State Transitions**: For each quest, update the DP state by considering whether to include the quest. If including the quest:
     - For \( j < K \), the discarded sum remains 0.
     - For \( j \geq K \), the new trauma value is added to the discarded sum.
   - **Result Extraction**: After processing all quests, iterate through all DP states to find the minimum trauma rating where the achieved level is at least \( L \).

### Solution Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;

const int MAX_SUM = 23000;
const ll INF = 1.5e18;

int main() {
    int n, k;
    ll L;
    cin >> n >> k >> L;
    vector<tuple<ll, ll, int>> quests(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        ll M, X;
        int T;
        cin >> M >> X >> T;
        quests[i] = make_tuple(M, X, T);
    }
    sort(quests.begin(), quests.end());

    vector<vector<ll>> dp(n + 1, vector<ll>(MAX_SUM + 1, -INF));
    dp[0][0] = 0;

    for (int idx = 0; idx < n; idx++) {
        auto [M, X, T] = quests[idx];
        auto new_dp = dp;
        for (int j = n - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            for (int s = 0; s <= MAX_SUM; s++) {
                if (dp[j][s] == -INF) continue;
                if (dp[j][s] < M) continue;
                ll new_level = dp[j][s] + X;
                if (new_level > INF) new_level = INF;
                int next_j = j + 1;
                int next_s = s;
                if (next_j > k) {
                    if (s + T > MAX_SUM) continue;
                    next_s = s + T;
                }
                if (new_level > new_dp[next_j][next_s]) {
                    new_dp[next_j][next_s] = new_level;
                }
            }
        }
        dp = new_dp;
    }

    ll ans = INF;
    for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
        for (int s = 0; s <= MAX_SUM; s++) {
            if (dp[j][s] >= L) {
                if (j <= k) {
                    int total_trauma = 0;
                    for (int i = 0; i < j; i++) {
                        auto [M, X, T] = quests[i];
                        total_trauma += T;
                    }
                    if (total_trauma < ans) {
                        ans = total_trauma;
                    }
                } else {
                    ll trauma_rating = total_trauma - s;
                    if (trauma_rating < ans) {
                        ans = trauma_rating;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Input Handling and Initialization**: The input consists of the number of quests \( N \), the trauma memory limit \( K \), and the target level \( L \). Each quest's details (minimum level, level gain, trauma value) are stored in a vector and sorted by minimum level requirement.
2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: A DP table `dp[j][s]` is initialized to store the maximum level achievable with `j` quests completed and `s` being the sum of the smallest \( \max(0, j - K) \) trauma values.
3. **DP State Transitions**: For each quest, the DP table is updated by considering whether to include the quest. If included:
   - For \( j < K \), the discarded trauma sum remains unchanged.
   - For \( j \geq K \), the new trauma value is added to the discarded sum.
4. **Result Extraction**: After processing all quests, the solution iterates through all DP states to find the minimum trauma rating where the achieved level is at least \( L \). For states with \( j \leq K \), the trauma rating is the total trauma sum of the completed quests. For \( j > K \), it is the total trauma sum minus the discarded sum.
5. **Output**: The minimum trauma rating meeting the level requirement is printed.

This approach efficiently handles the constraints by leveraging dynamic programming to explore feasible quest combinations while minimizing the trauma rating.
