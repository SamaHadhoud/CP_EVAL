To solve this problem, we need to count the number of pairs \((A, B)\) such that \(L \le B \le A \le R\) and \((A + B) \mid (A - B) = A + B\). The key insight is recognizing that the condition \((A + B) \mid (A - B) = A + B\) is equivalent to \((A - B) \& (B \ll 1) = 0\). This means that for any bit set in \(A - B\), the corresponding bit in \(B\) shifted left by 1 must be unset.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires counting valid pairs \((A, B)\) within the range \([L, R]\) where \(B \le A\) and the bitwise condition holds. The condition ensures that \(A - B\) and \(2B\) (i.e., \(B\) shifted left by 1) have no overlapping set bits.
2. **Digit Dynamic Programming (Digit DP)**: Given the constraints \(0 \le L \le R \le 2 \times 10^9\), a brute-force approach is infeasible. Instead, we use digit DP to efficiently count valid pairs by processing each bit from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB).
3. **State Representation**: The DP state is defined by:
   - **i**: Current bit index (0 to 31).
   - **carry**: Carry from the addition of lower bits (0 or 1).
   - **tl**: Tight constraint for \(B\) with respect to \(L\) (1 if the current prefix matches \(L\)'s prefix, else 0).
   - **th**: Tight constraint for \(B\) with respect to \(R\) (1 if the current prefix matches \(R\)'s prefix, else 0).
   - **tb**: Tight constraint for \(A\) with respect to \(R\) (1 if the current prefix matches \(R\)'s prefix, else 0).
   - **prev**: The bit value of \(B\) at the previous bit position (used to enforce the bitwise condition).
4. **Transitions**: For each bit position, iterate over possible bits for \(B\) and \(x\) (where \(x = A - B\)). Skip transitions where \(x\)'s current bit is 1 and \(B\)'s previous bit is 1. Update the carry and tight constraints based on the current bits.
5. **Base Case**: After processing all 32 bits, if the carry is zero, the state contributes 1 to the count.

### Solution Code
```python
import sys
from functools import lru_cache

def main():
    global L_val, R_val
    L_val, R_val = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    
    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    def dfs(i, carry, tl, th, tb, prev):
        if i == 32:
            return 1 if carry == 0 else 0
        
        L_i = (L_val >> i) & 1
        R_i = (R_val >> i) & 1
        
        res = 0
        low_B = L_i if tl else 0
        high_B = R_i if th else 1
        
        for b in range(low_B, high_B + 1):
            for x in [0, 1]:
                if i > 0 and x == 1 and prev == 1:
                    continue
                
                total = b + x + carry
                bit = total & 1
                new_carry = total // 2
                
                if tb:
                    if bit > R_i:
                        continue
                    new_tb = 1 if (bit == R_i) else 0
                else:
                    new_tb = 0
                
                new_tl = 1 if (tl and (b == L_i)) else 0
                new_th = 1 if (th and (b == R_i)) else 0
                
                res += dfs(i + 1, new_carry, new_tl, new_th, new_tb, b)
        return res
    
    result = dfs(0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0)
    print(result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: The input values \(L\) and \(R\) are read and stored as global variables.
2. **Digit DP Function (dfs)**: The function uses memoization to store intermediate results. The state parameters represent the current bit position, carry from previous additions, tight constraints for \(B\) and \(A\), and the previous bit of \(B\).
3. **Bit Processing**: For each bit position (0 to 31), the function checks the current bits of \(L\) and \(R\) to determine valid bits for \(B\).
4. **Transition Handling**: For each valid bit of \(B\) and \(x\) (the difference \(A - B\)), the function checks the bitwise condition. If the condition is satisfied, it updates the carry and tight constraints for the next bit.
5. **Base Case Handling**: After processing all 32 bits, if there's no carry, the current state is valid and contributes 1 to the count.
6. **Result Calculation**: The initial call to `dfs` starts from bit 0 with no carry, tight constraints enabled, and the previous bit set to 0. The result is printed after the DP completes.

This approach efficiently counts valid pairs by leveraging digit DP to handle large input ranges while enforcing the bitwise condition and constraints. The solution processes each bit position recursively, updating the state based on current bit choices and constraints, ensuring optimal performance.
