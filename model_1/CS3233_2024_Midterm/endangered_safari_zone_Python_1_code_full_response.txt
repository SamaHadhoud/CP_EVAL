To solve this problem, we need to efficiently handle two types of operations on an array: updating the species of a Pok√©mon at a specific zone and querying the number of distinct species that appear at most K times in a given range [A, B]. Given the constraints (N, M, K up to 100,000), a direct approach for each query would be too slow. Instead, we use an offline processing technique known as **Mo's Algorithm with Updates**, which efficiently handles range queries and point updates by processing them in a specific order.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves processing range queries and point updates on an array where each query requires counting distinct species in a range [A, B] that appear at most K times. The challenge is to handle these operations efficiently within the given constraints.
2. **Key Insight**: For each query, the answer is the number of distinct species in the range minus those species that appear more than K times (bad species). We maintain frequency counts for each species and track the number of distinct species and bad species dynamically.
3. **Algorithm Selection**: Mo's Algorithm with Updates is chosen because it efficiently processes range queries and point updates by treating updates as a third dimension. Queries are sorted based on blocks of the left endpoint, right endpoint, and the number of updates applied, minimizing the number of operations when moving between queries.
4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in \(O((N + Q) \cdot N^{2/3})\) time, where \(N\) is the number of elements and \(Q\) is the number of queries. This complexity is feasible for the given constraints.

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: The initial array of species is read, and species values are converted to 0-based indexing for easier handling.
2. **Processing Operations**: Operations are processed to separate updates (changing species at a zone) and queries (counting distinct species in a range). For each update, the old and new species values are recorded.
3. **Query Sorting**: Queries are sorted using Mo's algorithm criteria (left block, right block, and time stamp) to minimize the number of operations during processing.
4. **Mo's Algorithm Execution**: 
   - **Time Adjustment**: Updates are applied or reverted to match the query's time stamp.
   - **Range Adjustment**: The current range is expanded or shrunk to match the query's range, updating frequency counts for species.
   - **Answer Calculation**: For each query, the answer is the number of distinct species minus those appearing more than K times.
5. **Output**: Answers for each query are printed in the original order.

This approach efficiently handles dynamic updates and range queries, leveraging Mo's algorithm with updates to meet the problem constraints.
