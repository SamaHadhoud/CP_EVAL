 We are going to follow the editorial: use binary search on the minimum interval length L.
 Steps:
 1. Parse the input: convert HH:MM to total minutes (integer).
 2. The constraints: 
      - The first interval's start is fixed, and the last interval's end is fixed.
      - We can only extend the intervals (so the new start <= original start, and new end >= original end).
      - The intervals must be non-overlapping and contiguous? Actually, the problem does not require contiguous, but our propagation in the feasibility check will make them contiguous (by setting the end of interval i to the start of interval i+1). This is the natural way to maximize the available time for each interval.

 3. We define a feasible(L) function:
      - We start from the last interval and go backwards.
      - For the last interval: 
          - The end is fixed to the original last_end (by constraint 2: closing time unchanged). 
          - So the start of the last interval must be at most the original start and at least (last_end - L). 
          - We set: A[n-1] = min(original_start[n-1], last_end - L)   [this is the new start of the last interval]
          - Then the end of the second last interval must be set to the start of the last interval (so that they are contiguous and non-overlapping, and we are using the entire time without gaps? Actually, we are allowed to have gaps? But note condition 1: we are only allowed to extend. However, extending might create gaps? But the problem says the original intervals are non-overlapping and in chronological order. The extension must not cause overlap? Actually, the problem does not explicitly forbid gaps, but condition 1 only requires that the amended interval includes the original. However, if we leave gaps, then we are not using the time optimally for extending the intervals. Therefore, to maximize the minimum interval, we want to use all the time without gaps? 

    However, note: the problem does not require the intervals to be contiguous. But if we leave gaps, we are not using the time to extend the intervals, so we might be able to get a larger L by using the gaps? Actually, we are free to leave gaps? But the propagation we use (making the intervals contiguous) is optimal because any gap could be distributed to adjacent intervals to potentially increase the minimum. Therefore, we can assume that the optimal solution has contiguous intervals? 

    Why? Consider: if there is a gap, we can always extend the previous interval to cover the gap and then adjust the next interval accordingly, which might help in increasing the length of the previous interval without decreasing the next one below L? Actually, we are constrained by the requirement that the interval must include the original. But if we extend the previous interval to cover the gap, we are still including the original. And we can then adjust the next interval's start to be earlier? But the next interval's start cannot be made earlier than its original start? Actually, condition 1: we can only extend the interval, meaning we can set the start earlier than the original? Yes. But note: we are allowed to set the start earlier and the end later.

    However, the feasibility check we do by backward propagation (making intervals contiguous) is standard and known to work for such problems (like maximizing the minimum segment in a fixed total length). Therefore, we proceed:

    Steps for backward propagation for feasibility(L):
      Let A[i] = new start time of interval i
      Let B[i] = new end time of interval i

      Constraints:
        A[i] <= original_start[i]
        B[i] >= original_end[i]
        B[i] = A[i+1]   (we make the intervals contiguous: the end of i is the start of i+1)
        and each interval must be at least L: B[i] - A[i] >= L.

      We start from the last interval i = n-1:
        B[n-1] = last_end (fixed)
        A[n-1] = min(original_start[n-1], last_end - L)   -> but also we have the constraint that the interval must be at least L: so A[n-1] must be <= last_end - L? Actually, we set A[n-1] = min(original_start[n-1], last_end - L) to satisfy:
          - We cannot start earlier than the original start? Actually, condition 1: we can extend the start to be earlier than the original? Yes, but we are allowed to set it to any time as long as it is <= the original start? Actually, condition 1: the amended interval must include the original. So the new start must be <= original_start and the new end must be >= original_end.

        Therefore, we set A[n-1] as early as possible (to maximize the chance for the previous intervals) but constrained by the original start (we cannot set it to a time later than the original start) and by the need to have at least L minutes: so A[n-1] = min(original_start[n-1], last_end - L). But if last_end - L is less than the original_start[n-1], then we set A[n-1] = last_end - L, which is earlier than the original start? That is allowed? Condition 1: the amended interval must include the original. So the original interval [s, e] must be contained in [A, B]. So we require A <= s and B>=e. Therefore, setting A[n-1] to last_end - L (which is <= original_start[n-1]) is acceptable.

        However, if last_end - L is too early (say, earlier than the restaurant's opening? But the opening is fixed by the first interval's start and we are not changing that? Actually, the restaurant's entire time is from first_start to last_end, and we are allowed to extend the last interval to start as early as we want as long as it doesn't violate the fixed endpoints? But note: the first interval's start is fixed, but the last interval's start can be extended arbitrarily early? Actually, condition 2: only the opening (first interval start) and closing (last interval end) are fixed. So we can set the last interval's start as early as we want? However, the constraint is only that the last interval must start at or before its original start? Actually, condition 1: we can set the start earlier than the original? Yes.

        But wait: condition 1 says the amended interval must include the original. So the new interval must cover the original. Therefore, the new start must be <= the original start, and the new end must be >= the original end.

        So for the last interval, we set:
          B[n-1] = last_end (fixed)
          A[n-1] = min(original_start[n-1], last_end - L)   -> but note: we must have A[n-1] <= original_start[n-1]. This condition is satisfied by the min. Also, we require the length to be at least L: so if we set A[n-1] = last_end - L, then the length is L. If we set A[n-1] = original_start[n-1], then the length is last_end - original_start[n-1] which must be >= L? Actually, if last_end - original_start[n-1] < L, then we cannot set A[n-1] to original_start[n-1] because then the length would be less than L. Instead, we set A[n-1] = last_end - L. But then we are setting the start earlier than the original start? That is allowed.

        However, we must also ensure that the original interval is contained: the original start is at least A[n-1] and the original end is at most last_end. Since we set A[n-1] <= original_start[n-1] and last_end >= original_end[n-1] (and the original_end[n-1] is by the input the end of the last interval, which we are leaving fixed? Actually, note: condition 2 says the closing time (last_end) is unchanged, so last_end is the same as the original_end[n-1]? Actually, the input last_end is the original_end[n-1]. So we are setting the new end to last_end, which is the same as the original_end. Therefore, condition 1 is satisfied for the last interval: the new interval [A[n-1], last_end] includes the original [original_start[n-1], original_end[n-1]] because A[n-1] <= original_start[n-1] and last_end = original_end[n-1] (so the original end is the same as the new end). But wait: the original_end[n-1] is the same as the new end? Yes, because we are not changing the last end. So condition 1 is satisfied.

      Then for interval i (from n-2 down to 0):
        We set: 
          B[i] = A[i+1]   (because the intervals are contiguous: the end of i is the start of i+1)
          Then the start A[i] = min(original_start[i], B[i] - L)

        We must check: 
          - Condition 1: A[i] <= original_start[i] (by the min, this is true) and B[i] >= original_end[i]? We set B[i] = A[i+1]. We must have A[i+1] >= original_end[i]? But note: condition 1 for interval i requires the new end (B[i]) to be >= original_end[i]. So we must check that.

        How do we enforce that? Actually, we are setting A[i] = min(original_start[i], B[i]-L). Then we have to check that B[i] (which is A[i+1]) is >= original_end[i]. If it is not, then the candidate L is not feasible.

      Finally, for the first interval, we require A[0] = first_start? Condition 2: the opening time remains unchanged. So we require the new start of the first interval to be the same as the original? Actually, condition 2: "the starting time of the first interval" remains unchanged. Therefore, we must have A[0] = first_start.

      Therefore, the feasibility check:
        - Start from last interval: 
            A[n-1] = min(s_list[n-1], last_end - L)
            Then set B[n-1] = last_end.
        - For i from n-2 down to 0:
            B[i] = A[i+1]
            A[i] = min(s_list[i], B[i] - L)
        - Then check:
            (a) A[0] == first_start? (must be exactly the original start)
            (b) For every interval i: B[i] >= e_list[i] (the original end)

        However, note: condition (a) might fail if when we set A[0] = min(s_list[0], B[0]-L) we get something less than first_start? Actually, s_list[0] is the original start of the first interval, which is first_start. So we set A[0] = min(first_start, B[0]-L). But we require A[0] to be first_start? Then we must have min(first_start, B[0]-L) = first_start. This implies that first_start <= B[0]-L? Or if we choose first_start, then we require that first_start <= B[0]-L? Actually, no: if we choose first_start, then the condition is satisfied regardless of B[0]-L? But wait: we set A[0] = min(first_start, B[0]-L). So if B[0]-L >= first_start, then min(first_start, B[0]-L) = first_start. If B[0]-L < first_start, then we set A[0] = B[0]-L, which is less than first_start. But then condition (a) fails because we require A[0] to be first_start.

        Therefore, we must ensure that the propagation leads to A[0] being exactly first_start.

        How? We can force that the first interval's start is fixed to first_start? Actually, we can adjust the feasibility function: in the backward propagation, when we get to i=0, we set A[0] = first_start? But then we must check that first_start <= min(s_list[0], B[0]-L)? Actually, s_list[0] is first_start. So we require first_start <= B[0]-L? And also we require that the new end B[0] must be at least the original end e_list[0]. 

        Alternatively, we can do:

          For i=0, we do not set by the min? Instead, we require that the propagation must leave A[0] <= first_start? But condition 2 says the first start must be unchanged -> so A[0] must be exactly first_start.

        Therefore, we can do:

          After backward propagation, we check:
            A[0] must be <= first_start (because we set it to min(s_list[0], ...) and s_list[0] is first_start -> so A[0] <= first_start.
            But we require A[0] = first_start. So if we get A[0] < first_start, we can adjust? Actually, we cannot: because we cannot set the first interval's start to a time later than the original? Condition 1: we can only extend, meaning we can set it earlier? But condition 2: the opening time (first start) must remain unchanged. So we require A[0] = first_start.

        Therefore, if we get A[0] < first_start, we must set A[0] to first_start? Then we break the propagation? Actually, we have already propagated backwards. So if A[0] is less than first_start, we can set A[0] to first_start? But then we must check that the interval length for the first interval is at least L: we require B[0] - first_start >= L -> so B[0] >= first_start + L. But in our propagation, B[0] = A[1] and we set A[0] = min(first_start, B[0]-L). If we set A[0] to first_start, then we require first_start <= B[0]-L -> i.e., B[0] >= first_start+L.

        Alternatively, we can adjust the propagation for the first interval: after propagating from the last to the first, we set A[0] to first_start and then check if the entire schedule is valid? But then the intervals might break the contiguous property? Actually, we can break the contiguous property? The problem does not require contiguous intervals, but condition 1 and 2 must hold.

        However, note: we are allowed to leave gaps? But the propagation we did was to make them contiguous. If we set A[0] to first_start and we had computed A[1] = ... and then set B[0] = A[1], then if we set A[0] to first_start, we must have first_start <= A[1]? Yes, because the intervals are non-overlapping and in chronological order. But we might have a gap from first_start to A[1]? Then we are not using the time optimally? Actually, we can use the gap to extend the first interval? But we set the first interval to [first_start, A[1]]. Then the length is A[1] - first_start. We require that to be at least L. But we also have the constraint that the end of the first interval (which is A[1]) must be at least the original end e_list[0]. 

        Therefore, we can adjust the feasibility check for the first interval: after propagating from last to first (including i=0) we get A[0]. Then we set A[0] = first_start? But then we must have A[0] (the computed one) <= first_start? Actually, we set A[0] = min(first_start, B[0]-L). So if we get A[0] < first_start, we can set it to first_start? But then the interval [first_start, B[0]] must be at least L? -> we require B[0] - first_start >= L. Also, we must have B[0] >= e_list[0]. 

        But note: in our propagation, we set B[0] = A[1]. Then if we change A[0] to first_start, then the gap from first_start to A[1] is the entire first interval? That's acceptable.

        However, the propagation for interval 0 was computed with the condition that A[0] = min(first_start, B[0]-L). If we set A[0] to first_start, then we are effectively increasing the start of the first interval? Actually, we are increasing it from a value (say x) to first_start, which is greater than x? Then the interval becomes shorter? But we are constrained by the original interval: the new interval must include the original [first_start, e_list[0]]. If we set the start to first_start, that is the same as the original, so condition 1 is satisfied for the start. But the end is still B[0] = A[1] which we computed to be at least e_list[0]? We have to check that in the propagation.

        Alternatively, we can enforce in the propagation that the first interval's start must be first_start? How? In the backward propagation, we do:

          For i from n-1 down to 1: ... then for i=0, we set:
            B[0] = A[1]
            Then we set A[0] = min(first_start, B[0]-L)   -> but we require that the result must be first_start. Therefore, we require that min(first_start, B[0]-L) == first_start. This happens if and only if first_start <= B[0]-L? Or if first_start <= B[0]-L then min is first_start. Otherwise, we set A[0]=B[0]-L which is less than first_start -> then we must fail.

        Therefore, we can check at the end: if A[0] != first_start, then the candidate L is not feasible.

      So the feasibility function:

        Set:
          A[n-1] = min(s_list[n-1], last_end - L)
          B[n-1] = last_end

        For i from n-2 down to 0:
          B[i] = A[i+1]
          A[i] = min(s_list[i], B[i] - L)

        Then check:
          A[0] == first_start
          and for every i, B[i] >= e_list[i]

        Why check B[i] >= e_list[i]? Because condition 1: the new interval must cover the original. We have set A[i] <= s_list[i] (by the min) and we set B[i] = A[i+1] (which we hope is at least e_list[i]). But we must check that.

        However, note: in the propagation, we do not explicitly check the condition for the original end? We only set the start and the end by the contiguous property. So we must check that the new end (B[i]) is at least the original end.

        Therefore, we must check for every i: B[i] >= e_list[i].

      Also, we must check the length of each interval? Actually, we set A[i] <= B[i]-L? Because we set A[i] = min(s_list[i], B[i]-L). Then the interval length is B[i]-A[i] >= L? 
        - If A[i] = s_list[i], then we require that the length (B[i]-s_list[i]) >= L? But note: we set A[i]=s_list[i] only if s_list[i] <= B[i]-L, which implies B[i]-s_list[i] >= L -> so the length is at least L.
        - If A[i] = B[i]-L, then the length is L, which is exactly L -> so also at least L.

        Therefore, the length condition is satisfied.

      Therefore, the feasibility check:

        A = [0]*n, B = [0]*n
        B[n-1] = last_end
        A[n-1] = min(s_list[n-1], last_end - L)

        For i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
            B[i] = A[i+1]
            A[i] = min(s_list[i], B[i]-L)

        Then check:
          A[0] == first_start
          for every i: B[i] >= e_list[i]

        If both conditions hold, then L is feasible.

 4. Binary search: we search for the maximum L such that feasible(L) is True.

 5. Then, we reconstruct the schedule with the optimal L (maximal feasible L) and output.

 However, note: the sample input 2: 
        "2
         19:01 - 19:02
         19:03 - 19:04"

     The sample output is:
         19:01 - 19:03
         19:03 - 19:04

     Let's test our feasibility for L=1:

        Convert to minutes: 
          first_start = 19:01 -> 19*60+1 = 1141
          intervals: 
            [1141, 1142] and [1143, 1144]   (because 19:03 is 1143, 19:04 is 1144)

        last_end = 1144.

        Propagation:
          i=1 (last interval): 
            B[1] = 1144
            A[1] = min(1143, 1144-1) = min(1143,1143) = 1143.

          i=0:
            B[0] = A[1] = 1143
            A[0] = min(1141, 1143-1) = min(1141,1142) = 1141.

        Conditions:
          A[0] = 1141 -> equals first_start? yes.
          Check ends: 
            B[0]=1143 >= e_list[0]=1142? yes.
            B[1]=1144 >= e_list[1]=1144? yes.

        So L=1 is feasible.

        Then the schedule for the first interval is [1141,1143] -> 19:01 - 19:03, and the second [1143,1144] -> 19:03-19:04.

        But what about L=2? 
          i=1: A[1] = min(1143, 1144-2)=min(1143,1142)=1142 -> then B[1]=1144 -> the interval for the second becomes [1142,1144] (length=2) -> but condition 1: the second interval must include [1143,1144]. It does? because 1142<=1143 and 1144>=1144 -> yes.

          Then for i=0:
            B[0] = A[1] = 1142
            A[0] = min(1141, 1142-2)=min(1141,1140)=1140.

          Then A[0]=1140, but we require A[0] = first_start=1141 -> fails.

        Therefore, L=2 is not feasible.

        So the maximum L is 1.

        However, the sample output is with L=1? But the first interval has length 2 minutes? Actually: 19:01 to 19:03 is 2 minutes. And the second has 1 minute? But we set L=1 -> the minimum interval length is 1, which is achieved by the second interval. 

        But note: we are maximizing the minimum interval length. The candidate L=1 is feasible, and L=2 is not. So the answer for the sample is L=1? Then why the sample output has the first interval of 2 minutes and the second of 1? That satisfies that the minimum is 1. But we can also have:

          Option 1: [19:01,19:02] and [19:02,19:04] -> then the first interval is 1 minute and the second is 2 minutes -> minimum is 1 -> same as L=1.

          But the sample output is different? They output:
            "19:01 - 19:03"
            "19:03 - 19:04"

          Why? Because the problem says: "if there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them".

        How did we get the sample output? 
          For L=1, we computed:
            A[0]=1141, B[0]=1143 -> 19:01 to 19:03
            A[1]=1143, B[1]=1144 -> 19:03 to 19:04.

        So we output that.

 6. Implementation:

    Steps:
      - Parse the input: convert each time string to minutes.
      - Binary search: low=0, high = last_end - first_start (in minutes).
      - For each mid, check feasibility(mid) as described.

    However, note: the intervals must be non-overlapping? Our propagation by making contiguous (end_i = start_{i+1}) ensures non-overlapping and contiguous.

    But condition 1: the amended interval must include the original. We are setting A[i] <= s_list[i] and B[i] >= e_list[i]. So the original interval [s_list[i], e_list[i]] is contained in [A[i], B[i]]. 

    Condition 2: the first start is fixed to the original first_start and the last end is fixed to the original last_end.

    Therefore, the solution should be correct.

 7. Edge: the time conversion: from 16:00 to 23:59 -> within one day.

 8. Output: convert minutes back to HH:MM (with leading zeros for minutes).

 Let's code accordingly.

  Important: In the feasibility check, we must check for every interval i: B[i] >= e_list[i]. We do that in a loop after propagation.

  Also, we require A[0] == first_start.

  If we find a candidate L that is feasible, we do the same propagation for that L to get the schedule and output.

  Note: we are going to do the propagation for the optimal L at the end.

 Implementation:

   Convert the input times to minutes (integers).

   first_start = s_list[0]
   last_end = e_list[n-1]

   Define feasible(L):
        A = [0]*n
        B = [0]*n
        # Last interval
        B[n-1] = last_end
        A[n-1] = min(s_list[n-1], last_end - L)

        # Propagate backwards for i from n-2 down to 0
        for i from n-2 down to 0:
            B[i] = A[i+1]
            A[i] = min(s_list[i], B[i] - L)

        # Check conditions:
        if A[0] != first_start:
            return False

        for i in range(n):
            if B[i] < e_list[i]:
                return False

        return True

   Then binary search for the maximum L such that feasible(L) is True.

   Then, use that L to compute the schedule (the same propagation) and output.

 9. However, note: what if the propagation sets A[i] to a value that is too early? For example, if the restaurant has a constraint that the time must be between 16:00 and 23:59? But the problem says the intervals are within the same day and between 16:00 and 23:59. Our propagation only uses times that are within the total minutes from the input? We are extending the intervals, but we are bounded by the original starts? Actually, we set A[i] = min(s_list[i], ...). So if we set A[i] to a value less than s_list[i], that is allowed as long as it doesn't go before 16:00? But the problem does not restrict the time to be at least 16:00? Actually, the problem says: "the time intervals are all within the same day, between 16:00 and 23:59 (inclusive)". So the original starts are at least 16:00. But we are extending the intervals to start earlier? Then we might set a start earlier than 16:00? 

    Condition: the entire schedule must be between 16:00 and 23:59? The problem says: "between 16:00 and 23:59 (inclusive)". So we must not set any time earlier than 16:00? 

    How to enforce? We can adjust the conversion: 16:00 is 16*60 = 960 minutes, 23:59 is 23*60+59 = 1439 minutes.

    But note: the original intervals are within [16:00, 23:59]. And we are extending? Condition 1: we are only extending the intervals? But condition 2: the opening (first start) is unchanged. The first start is at least 16:00? The input says the intervals are between 16:00 and 23:59. So the first start is at least 16:00. And we set the first start to the original first start? Then we are not extending the first start to an earlier time? Actually, we are: condition 1 allows extending the start to be earlier? But condition 2: the opening time remains unchanged -> meaning the first start must be unchanged? So the first start is fixed to the original (which is at least 16:00). Then the other starts? They might be extended arbitrarily early? But then we might set a start to a time earlier than 16:00? 

    We must avoid that. How? We can adjust the to_minutes function to convert to minutes from 00:00? Then we can check if any A[i] is less than 16:00? But the problem says the entire schedule must be between 16:00 and 23:59. Therefore, we must not set any time earlier than 16:00.

    How to enforce? In the feasibility propagation, we must ensure that A[i] >= 16:00? Actually, the original starts are at least 16:00, and we are setting A[i] = min(s_list[i], ...). So if we set A[i] to a value less than 16:00, that would be invalid.

    Therefore, we must adjust the min function? Actually, we can set:

        A[i] = min(s_list[i], B[i]-L)   -> but we must also ensure A[i] >= 16:00? 

        How? We can set A[i] = max(16*60, min(s_list[i], B[i]-L))? But wait: condition 1: we can only extend the interval? Condition 1 requires the new interval to include the original. So if we set the start to 16:00, that is earlier than the original? Then condition 1 is satisfied? But condition 2: the opening time is the first interval's start? We are allowed to extend the other intervals arbitrarily? But the problem says: "The opening and closing time of the restaurant remains unchanged. That is, you cannot change the starting time of the first interval or the ending time of the last interval." -> so only the first interval's start and last interval's end are fixed. The other starts? We can set them to any time as long as they are not later than the original start? and as long as the entire time is between 16:00 and 23:59.

        However, note: the problem says the original intervals are between 16:00 and 23:59. And we are extending? We are not allowed to set a time outside [16:00, 23:59]? The problem says "the time intervals are all within the same day, between 16:00 and 23:59 (inclusive)". So the amended intervals must also be within [16:00, 23:59]? 

        Therefore, we must ensure that all A[i] >= 16*60 and all B[i] <= 23*60+59? Actually, the last_end is fixed to the original last_end which is within [16:00,23:59]. And the first_start is fixed to the original first_start which is within [16:00,23:59]. But the propagation might set an intermediate start to a time earlier than 16:00? 

        Therefore, we must add a constraint: A[i] >= 16*60? 

        How? In the min function: we can do:

          candidate = min(s_list[i], B[i]-L)
          if candidate < 16*60, then we set candidate = 16*60? But then condition 1: we require A[i] <= s_list[i]? If we set A[i]=16*60, that is <= s_list[i]? because s_list[i]>=16*60? yes. So it is allowed.

        Then we set: A[i] = max(16*60, min(s_list[i], B[i]-L))

        Similarly, we must ensure that the end of an interval does not exceed 23:59? But the last_end is fixed to a value <= 23:59, and we set B[i]=A[i+1] (which is at least 16*60 and at most last_end) so it should be within [16:00,23:59]. But what about the intermediate intervals? The propagation sets B[i] = A[i+1]. And we set A[i+1] to at least 16*60? Then B[i] is at least 16*60. And the last_end is at most 23:59. So the entire schedule is within [16:00,23:59]? 

        However, what about the constraint that the entire restaurant time is from the first_start to last_end? The problem does not require the intervals to cover the entire [16:00,23:59]? Only that they are within that period.

        Therefore, we adjust the propagation for A[i] to be at least 16*60.

        Then the feasibility function becomes:

          A[n-1] = min(s_list[n-1], last_end - L)
          A[n-1] = max(16*60, A[n-1])   // but note: s_list[n-1] is at least 16*60? The input guarantee. So min(s_list[n-1], last_end-L) might be less than 16*60? Then we set to 16*60.

          Then for i from n-2 down to 0:
             B[i] = A[i+1]
             A[i] = min(s_list[i], B[i]-L)
             A[i] = max(16*60, A[i])

        Then check A[0]==first_start and for every i: B[i]>=e_list[i].

        But note: the first_start is at least 16*60? Then if we set A[0] = max(16*60, ...) and the first_start is at least 16*60, then if we get A[0] = first_start, the max doesn't change it? 

        However, what if the propagation sets A[0] to a value greater than first_start? Then we set it to max(16*60, A[0]) which is A[0] -> then we have A[0] != first_start -> fails. 

        Actually, we set A[0] = min(s_list[0], B[0]-L) = min(first_start, B[0]-L). Then we clamp to at least 16*60. But first_start is at least 16*60. So if min(first_start, B[0]-L) is less than 16*60, then we set to 16*60. But then if first_start > 16*60, then we set A[0]=16*60, which is less than first_start? Then condition 1 is satisfied? But condition 2: the first interval's start must be unchanged? Condition 2 says: "you cannot change the starting time of the first interval". So we must have A[0] = first_start.

        Therefore, we cannot clamp the first_start to 16*60 if it is not 16*60? 

        How to fix? We can do the clamping for all intervals except the first? Actually, the first interval's start is fixed. So we can do:

          For the last interval and the others (i from n-1 to 1) we clamp to 16:00? Then for i=0 we don't clamp? But then the propagation for i=0 might set A[0] to less than 16:00? 

        Alternatively, we can note: the first_start is fixed and at least 16:00. Then when we set A[0] = min(first_start, B[0]-L), we get a value that is at most first_start (which is >=16:00). So A[0] is at least? It could be less than 16:00? Only if first_start is less than 16:00? But the input guarantee: the intervals are between 16:00 and 23:59. So first_start>=16:00. And if min(first_start, B[0]-L) is less than 16:00, then we must clamp? But then we break the condition that the first interval's start must be first_start.

        Therefore, we must avoid setting A[0] to a value less than 16:00? But the min function: if B[0]-L < first_start, then we set A[0]=B[0]-L. And if that is less than 16:00, then we set A[0]=16:00? Then we break the condition that the first start must be first_start.

        So we must ensure that in the propagation, we do not set A[0] to a value less than 16:00? Actually, the propagation for the entire chain must yield A[0] = first_start. And if we clamp the other A[i] to 16:00, then we might break the propagation? 

        Given the complexity, and since the input guarantee that the original intervals are between 16:00 and 23:59, and we are only extending the intervals (so the new times might be outside [16:00,23:59] only by being earlier than 16:00 for non-first intervals? Actually, the first interval's start is fixed to at least 16:00. Then the next interval's start is at least the first interval's end which is at least the original end of the first interval, which is at least 16:00? Actually, the original intervals are non-overlapping and in chronological order. The first interval's end is at least the first interval's start? Then the next interval's start is at least the first interval's end? Then if we extend the second interval to start earlier, we might set it to a time earlier than 16:00? 

        Therefore, we must clamp the non-first intervals? But condition 1: for the second interval, we can set the start as early as we want as long as it is not later than the original start? But the problem says the entire schedule must be in [16:00,23:59]. So we must set the start to at least 16:00.

        Therefore, we adjust:

          For i from n-1 down to 1: 
             A[i] = min(s_list[i], B[i]-L)
             A[i] = max(16*60, A[i])

          For i=0: 
             A[0] = min(s_list[0], B[0]-L)   -> but we don't clamp because we require A[0]=s_list[0] (which is the first_start and >=16:00). And if we set it to less than 16:00, then we fail the condition A[0]=first_start (which is >=16:00) -> so it will be caught by the check A[0]==first_start? 

        However, if the propagation for i=0 sets A[0] = B[0]-L < first_start, then we set A[0] = B[0]-L. Then we check: if A[0] != first_start -> fails. So we don't output a schedule that has an invalid time for the first interval? 

        But what about the non-first intervals? We clamp them to at least 16:00. Then we set:

          A[i] = max(16*60, min(s_list[i], B[i]-L))

        Then we must also check that the entire schedule does not exceed 23:59? The last_end is fixed and at most 23:59. And the propagation sets B[i]=A[i+1] (which is at least 16:00 and at most last_end). So the B[i] are at most last_end? 

        Therefore, we adjust the propagation for i>=1 to clamp the start to at least 16:00.

        But note: the propagation is backward. The last interval: 
          A[n-1] = min(s_list[n-1], last_end - L)
          Then clamp: A[n-1] = max(16*60, A[n-1])

        Then for i=n-2 down to 1: 
          B[i] = A[i+1]   (which is at least 16:00 and at most last_end)
          A[i] = min(s_list[i], B[i]-L)
          A[i] = max(16*60, A[i])

        Then for i=0:
          B[0] = A[1]   (which is at least 16:00)
          A[0] = min(s_list[0], B[0]-L)   -> without clamping? Then we check A[0]==first_start.

        Also, we check for every i: B[i]>=e_list[i] (which ensures the original interval is contained).

        Then we hope that the propagation for the first interval yields first_start? 

        But what if the propagation for the first interval sets A[0] to a value that is less than 16:00? Then we don't clamp, and then the condition A[0]==first_start fails? So we return false.

        Therefore, we do not need to explicitly check for 16:00 for the first interval? Because the first_start is at least 16:00, and we are setting A[0] to min(first_start, ...) -> so if we set A[0] to first_start, then it's at least 16:00. If we set to B[0]-L, then if that is less than 16:00, then we get A[0]=B[0]-L < 16:00, and then we check that A[0] must equal first_start (which is >=16:00) -> fails. So we don't output that schedule.

        But what if we set A[0]=B[0]-L and that is less than 16:00? Then we have an invalid time? Then the feasibility returns false. Then we try a smaller L.

        So we are safe.

        However, note: the propagation for the first interval: 
          A[0] = min(first_start, B[0]-L) 
          and if B[0]-L is less than 16:00, then we set A[0] = B[0]-L, which is less than 16:00 -> then we check A[0]==first_start -> fails.

        So we do not output a schedule with a time earlier than 16:00 for the first interval? 

        But condition 2: the first interval's start is fixed to the original, which is at least 16:00. Therefore, if we set A[0] to B[0]-L and that is less than 16:00, then we are forced to set A[0]=first_start? But then we require first_start <= B[0]-L? -> which is false because first_start>=16:00 and B[0]-L < 16:00. So we cannot set A[0]=first_start? Then we have no choice? Then the candidate L is not feasible.

        Therefore, we don't need to clamp the first interval? We only clamp the others.

        Let's code accordingly.

 10. Code for feasibility:

        def feasible(L):
            A = [0] * n
            B = [0] * n
            # Last interval
            B[n-1] = last_end
            A[n-1] = min(s_list[n-1], last_end - L)
            # Clamp for the last interval (if necessary) to 16:00? But the last_end is at least 16:00? And s_list[n-1] is at least 16:00? Then A[n-1] might be less than 16:00? Then we clamp.
            A[n-1] = max(16*60, A[n-1])

            for i in range(n-2, 0, -1):   # from i=n-2 down to 1
                B[i] = A[i+1]
                A[i] = min(s_list[i], B[i]-L)
                A[i] = max(16*60, A[i])

            # Now for i=0: we do separately? Actually, we have to do i=0 as well, but without clamping?
            # But the propagation for i=0 is the same as the others? Then we do:
            if n>=2:
                B[0] = A[1]
            else: # n==1? but n>=2 per the input
                pass
            A[0] = min(s_list[0], B[0]-L)
            # We do not clamp i=0? because we require A[0]=first_start, and if we clamp we break.

            if A[0] != first_start:
                return False

            # Check that every interval has end >= original end
            for i in range(n):
                if B[i] < e_list[i]:
                    return False

            return True

        However, what about the case n==1? The problem says n>=2.

        But note: we set B[0] for n>=2? What if n==2? then i=0: we set B[0] = A[1]. Then A[0]=min(s_list[0], B[0]-L).

        What if n==1? Then the above loop for i in range(n-2,0,-1) does not run. Then we set A[0]? We haven't set B[0] for n==1. So we must handle n==1 separately? But the input constraint: n>=2.

        Therefore, we assume n>=2.

        But what if n==1? The problem states n>=2.

        So we don't need to handle n==1.

        However, the propagation for the first interval (i=0) requires B[0]? For n>=2, we set B[0]=A[1]. For the last interval we set B[n-1]=last_end. Then we set A[n-1] as above.

        But what about the interval i=0? We set B[0]=A[1] (from the propagation for i=0). But we set A[1] in the loop? 

        Actually, we set A[n-1] and then for i from n-2 down to 1: we set A[i]. Then for i=0 we set B[0]=A[1] and then A[0]=min(s_list[0], B[0]-L).

        This works for n>=2.

        But wait: what if n==2? Then the loop for i in range(n-2,0,-1) is: n-2=0, so we run for i=0? But the loop: 
            for i in range(n-2, 0, -1): 
                ... 
            This runs for i=0? 

        Actually, in Python: range(start, stop, step) goes from start to stop-1? For n=2: n-2=0, and stop=0 -> so the loop runs for i=0? Then we set A[0] for i=0? Then we do the separate step for i=0 again? 

        Correction: we should do the propagation for i from n-2 down to 0? But then we clamp for i>=1? 

        Alternatively, we can do:

          A[n-1] = ... (clamped to 16:00)
          For i from n-2 down to 1: 
             B[i] = A[i+1]
             A[i] = max(16*60, min(s_list[i], B[i]-L))

          Then for the first interval (i=0):
             B[0] = A[1]
             A[0] = min(s_list[0], B[0]-L)   # without clamping

        But then we miss the propagation for the interval at index 0? Actually, we only set the first interval at the end. 

        Actually, we need to propagate for all intervals? 

        We can do:

          A = [0]*n
          B = [0]*n
          B[n-1] = last_end
          A[n-1] = max(16*60, min(s_list[n-1], last_end - L))

          for i in range(n-2, 0, -1):   # i from n-2 down to 1 (inclusive)
              B[i] = A[i+1]
              A[i] = max(16*60, min(s_list[i], B[i]-L))

          # Then set the first interval (i=0)
          if n>1:
              B[0] = A[1]
          A[0] = min(s_list[0], B[0]-L)   # note: for n=1, we set A[0] without setting B[0]? But n>=2, so we assume n>=2.

          Then check A[0]==first_start and for all i: B[i]>=e_list[i].

        But what about the propagation for the first interval? We set B[0]=A[1] and then A[0]=min(first_start, B[0]-L). 

        Then we check conditions.

        This should be correct.

 11. However, note: the propagation for the last interval and the others (i from n-2 down to 1) we clamp. Then the first interval we don't clamp. Then we check A[0]==first_start.

 12. But wait: the problem says the entire schedule must be between 16:00 and 23:59. We clamp the non-first intervals to at least 16:00. The last_end is at most 23:59. The propagation for the first interval: the first interval's start is fixed to first_start (which is at least 16:00) and the end B[0] is A[1] (which is at least 16:00). Then the first interval is [first_start, A[1]] and we have first_start>=16:00 and A[1]>=16:00? Then the entire schedule is within [16:00, last_end]? 

 13. Therefore, we code accordingly.

 14. But note: what if the clamping for the non-first intervals causes the propagation to be invalid? For example, if we set A[i] to 16:00, but then the condition B[i] = A[i+1] is set, and we require B[i] >= e_list[i]? Then we check that condition.

 15. We'll run the sample input 2 with n=2 and L=1 to see:

        first_start = 1141, last_end=1144.

        Last interval (i=1):
          B[1]=1144
          A[1]=min(1143,1144-1)=min(1143,1143)=1143 -> then clamp to max(16*60,1143)=1143.

        Then for i=0: (but we skip the loop for i from 0 down to 1? Actually, the loop runs for i from n-2=0 down to 1? Then for i=0: we set B[0]=A[1]=1143, and A[0]=max(16*60, min(1141,1143-1)) = max(960, min(1141,1142)) = max(960,1141)=1141. -> then we break the loop? Then we do the separate step for the first interval? Actually, we did the loop for i=0? Then we then do the first interval again? 

        How we avoid? We do the loop for i from n-2 down to 1, so for n=2, n-2=0, then the loop runs for i=0? Then we set A[0] for i=0? Then we then set the first interval (i=0) again? 

        We should avoid processing the first interval in the loop? 

        Therefore, we change the loop to run from n-2 down to 1? For n=2, that runs for i=0? But we don't want to process i=0 in the loop? 

        Actually, we want to process i from n-2 down to 1? Then the indices 1 to n-2? 

        For n=2: the loop runs for i from 0 down to 1? But that is an empty range? Because in Python: range(0,0,-1) -> does not run? 

        Let me check: 
          list(range(0,0,-1)) -> actually, it runs? 
          Actually, in Python: 
            for i in range(0,0,-1): -> does not run because the stop is 0 and we start at 0, and step -1: then we go below 0? 

        How about: 
          for i in range(0,0,-1): 
            print(i)   -> prints nothing.

        So for n=2: the loop for i in range(n-2,0,-1) = range(0,0,-1) -> no iteration.

        Then we set the first interval (i=0) separately: 
          B[0] = A[1] = 1143
          A[0] = min(1141, 1143-1)=min(1141,1142)=1141.

        Then check: A[0]==1141 -> true.

        Then check ends: 
          B[0]=1143>=e_list[0]=1142? true.
          B[1]=1144>=e_list[1]=1144? true.

        Then L=1 is feasible.

        Then we output [1141,1143] and [1143,1144].

        That matches.

 16. Therefore, we code accordingly.

 17. But note: what if the propagation for an intermediate interval sets A[i] to a value that is greater than s_list[i]? Actually, we set A[i] = min(s_list[i], B[i]-L). So it is at most s_list[i]. So condition 1: the new start is <= the original start? yes.

 18. Now, what if we set A[i] = 16:00 and the original start is later? Then we are extending the start to 16:00, which is earlier than the original start? Condition 1: the amended interval must include the original? Then we require that the new start (16:00) is <= the original start, which is true. So it is allowed.

 19. Therefore, the feasibility function:

        def feasible(L):
            A = [0] * n
            B = [0] * n
            # Last interval: index n-1
            B[n-1] = last_end
            A[n-1] = min(s_list[n-1], last_end - L)
            A[n-1] = max(16*60, A[n-1])

            # Propagate for indices from n-2 down to 1 (if any)
            for i in range(n-2, 0, -1):
                B[i] = A[i+1]
                A[i] = min(s_list[i], B[i]-L)
                A[i] = max(16*60, A[i])

            # For the first interval (index0) if n>=2: 
            if n>=2:
                B[0] = A[1]
            A[0] = min(s_list[0], B[0]-L)   # for n=1, we have not set B[0]? But n>=2.

            # But wait: what if n==1? The problem says n>=2, so we assume n>=2.

            if A[0] != first_start:
                return False

            for i in range(n):
                if B[i] < e_list[i]:
                    return False

            return True

 20. However, what about the length of the last interval? We set A[n-1]=min(s_list[n-1], last_end-L) and then clamp to 16:00. Then we set the interval length = last_end - A[n-1] >= L? 
        - If A[n-1] = s_list[n-1], then we require last_end - s_list[n-1] >= L? But we set A[n-1] = s_list[n-1] only if s_list[n-1] <= last_end - L -> which implies last_end - s_list[n-1] >= L -> so the length is at least L.
        - If A[n-1] = last_end - L, then the length is L -> at least L.
        - If we clamp: A[n-1]=16*60, then the length is last_end - 16*60. We require that to be >= L? But we set A[n-1] to 16*60 only if min(s_list[n-1], last_end-L) < 16*60. Then we set to 16*60. Then the length is last_end - 16*60. We must have last_end - 16*60 >= L? Otherwise, the length is less than L -> invalid.

        Therefore, we must also check that the length of the last interval is at least L? 

        But note: we set A[n-1] = max(16*60, min(s_list[n-1], last_end-L)). Then the length is last_end - A[n-1] >= L? 
          - If min(s_list[n-1], last_end-L) >= 16*60, then A[n-1]=min(s_list[n-1], last_end-L) and we are in one of the two cases above -> length>=L.
          - If min(s_list[n-1], last_end-L) < 16*60, then A[n-1]=16*60. Then the length = last_end - 16*60. But we require that to be >= L? How do we know? 

        Actually, we don't check. So we must check the last interval's length? 

        How? We can do: 
          if last_end - A[n-1] < L:
              return False

        But we also have the condition for the last interval: B[n-1]=last_end and we require B[n-1]>=e_list[n-1] -> but that is the original end, and the original end is last_end? Actually, the last_end is the original end. So we have last_end>=e_list[n-1] -> true. But the length condition is separate.

        We did not enforce that the last interval has length>=L? 

        Therefore, we must check the last interval: last_end - A[n-1] >= L.

        Similarly, for the intermediate intervals (i from 1 to n-2): we set A[i] = max(16*60, min(s_list[i], B[i]-L)) and then the length is B[i]-A[i] = A[i+1] - A[i]. But we set A[i] = min(s_list[i], B[i]-L) (clamped) -> so we have A[i] <= B[i]-L -> so the length is at least L? 

          - If we set A[i] = s_list[i], then we require B[i] - s_list[i] >= L? But we set A[i]=s_list[i] only if s_list[i] <= B[i]-L -> which implies B[i]-s_list[i]>=L -> so the length is at least L.
          - If we set A[i] = B[i]-L, then the length is L.
          - If we set A[i] = 16*60, then we have A[i] = 16*60, and we require B[i] - 16*60 >= L? But we set A[i]=16*60 only when min(s_list[i], B[i]-L) < 16*60. Then we set A[i]=16*60. Then the length = B[i]-16*60. But we must have B[i]-16*60>=L? Otherwise, the interval is too short.

        Therefore, we must also check for these intervals: if the length is at least L? 

        Alternatively, we can note: we set A[i] = min(s_list[i], B[i]-L) -> so we have A[i] <= B[i]-L -> so the length is at least L? But if we clamp, then we set A[i]=16*60, which might be greater than min(s_list[i], B[i]-L). Then we break the condition that the length is at least L? 

        Therefore, after clamping, we must check: 
          if B[i] - A[i] < L:
              return False

        But we do that for every interval? 

        Actually, we can do:

          for every interval i:
              if B[i] - A[i] < L:
                  return False

        But we also have the condition for the original end: B[i]>=e_list[i] and the condition for the first interval.

        Then we can replace the condition for the length? 

        However, we have already propagated to set A[i] = min(s_list[i], B[i]-L) (and then clamped) so without clamping the length would be at least L? But with clamping, we might set A[i] to 16*60, which might be larger than min(s_list[i], B[i]-L)? Then the length = B[i]-16*60 might be less than L? 

        Therefore, we must check for every interval the length condition.

        But then why not do:

          Instead of clamping, we set A[i] = min(s_list[i], B[i]-L) and then if A[i] < 16*60, we set A[i]=16*60, and then check the length: if B[i]-A[i] < L, then fail.

        But then we are doing the same as a separate check.

        Alternatively, we can do:

          for i in range(n):
              if B[i] - A[i] < L:
                  return False

          and also check A[0]==first_start and B[i]>=e_list[i].

        Then we don't need to worry about the clamping breaking the length? 

        So we can write:

          def feasible(L):
              A = [0]*n
              B = [0]*n
              # Last interval
              B[n-1] = last_end
              A[n-1] = min(s_list[n-1], last_end - L)
              A[n-1] = max(16*60, A[n-1])

              for i in range(n-2, 0, -1):
                  B[i] = A[i+1]
                  A[i] = min(s_list[i], B[i]-L)
                  A[i] = max(16*60, A[i])

              if n>=2:
                  B[0] = A[1]
              A[0] = min(s_list[0], B[0]-L)

              if A[0] != first_start:
                  return False

              for i in range(n):
                  # Condition 1: the new interval covers the original: B[i] >= e_list[i] 
                  if B[i] < e_list[i]:
                      return False
                  # Condition 2: the interval length is at least L
                  if B[i] - A[i] < L:
                      return False

              return True

        But note: the first interval: we set A[0] = min(s_list[0], B[0]-L), so the length is at least L? 
          - If A[0] = s_list[0], then we require B[0]-s_list[0]>=L? But we set A[0]=s_list[0] only if s_list[0] <= B[0]-L, which implies B[0]-s_list[0]>=L.
          - If A[0]=B[0]-L, then the length is L.
          -> So the first interval's length is at least L.

        Similarly, for the last interval and the intermediates (before clamping) the length is at least L. But after clamping, we might set A[i] to 16*60, and then the length might be less than L? 

        Therefore, we must check for all intervals: the length condition.

        So we do the for-loop at the end.

 21. This feasibility function is robust.

 22. But what about the entire schedule being within [16:00,23:59]? We have clamped the non-first intervals to at least 16:00. The first interval's start is first_start (at least 16:00). The last_end is at most 23:59. And the propagation ensures the end of each interval is the start of the next? Then the entire schedule is within [16:00, last_end]? And last_end<=23:59, so it is within [16:00,23:59].

 23. Therefore, we code accordingly.

 24. But note: the clamping might break the propagation for the previous interval? For example, we set A[i] to 16:60 (which is 16:00) even if B[i]-L is less than 16:00? Then when we go to the next interval (i-1), we set B[i-1]=A[i]=16:00, and then A[i-1]=min(s_list[i-1], 16:00 - L) -> which would be 16:00-L, and then we clamp to 16:00? Then the length of interval i-1: 16:00 - 16:00 = 0? -> then we fail the length condition.

 25. So it is handled.

 26. Given the complexity, we hope it works.

 27. We'll run the sample input 1:

        Input: 
          3
          19:00 - 20:00   -> 1140, 1200
          21:08 - 21:24   -> 1268, 1284
          22:00 - 22:46   -> 1320, 1366

        first_start = 1140, last_end=1366.

        We know the sample output has minimum interval length 15 minutes? 
          But the sample output intervals: 
            19:00-20:15 -> 75 minutes
            20:15-21:30 -> 75 minutes
            21:31-22:46 -> 75 minutes? Actually, 21:31 to 22:46 is 75 minutes? 
              21:31 to 22:46: (22:46-21:31) = 1 hour 15 minutes = 75 minutes.

          But the minimum is 75 minutes? Actually, wait: the sample output:

            19:00 - 20:15 -> 75 minutes
            20:15 - 21:30 -> 75 minutes
            21:31 - 22:46 -> 75 minutes? But 21:30 to 21:31 is a gap? 

          Actually, the output is:
            "19:00 - 20:15"
            "20:15 - 21:30"
            "21:31 - 22:46"

          Why a gap? Because the problem does not require contiguous? But condition 1: we are only allowed to extend? Extending the next interval to start later than the previous end is allowed? But then we leave a gap? 

          However, the sample input intervals are non-overlapping and in chronological order. The amended intervals are also non-overlapping? But they are not contiguous? 

          The problem does not require contiguous intervals. Condition 1 only requires that the amended interval includes the original. Condition 2: the first start and last end are fixed.

          How did we get a gap in the sample output? Our propagation makes the intervals contiguous. 

          The sample output has a gap between 21:30 and 21:31.

          But the sample output is:

            "19:00 - 20:15"
            "20:15 - 21:30"
            "21:31 - 22:46"

          How to achieve that with our propagation? 

          Our propagation sets the end of interval i to the start of interval i+1. So we would get:

            Interval0: [A0, A1]
            Interval1: [A1, A2]
            Interval2: [A2, last_end]

          Then we cannot have a gap.

          But the sample output has a gap. 

          Therefore, the sample solution is not contiguous? 

          How did they get that? 

          The problem: "if there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them"

          Our solution is contiguous. Is that acceptable? 

          Condition: the amended interval must include the original. 
            For the second interval: the original is [21:08,21:24]. The amended is [20:15,21:30] -> does it include [21:08,21:24]? 
                20:15 <= 21:08 and 21:30>=21:24 -> yes.
            For the third interval: [21:31,22:46] includes [22:00,22:46]? 
                21:31<=22:00 -> yes, and 22:46>=22:46 -> yes.

          So it is valid.

          But our propagation produces contiguous intervals. The sample output is not contiguous. 

          The problem does not require contiguous intervals. 

          How can we produce non-contiguous intervals? 

          We want to maximize the minimum length. The contiguous assignment is one valid solution. 

          Why did the sample output use a gap? 

          Note: if we do contiguous, then the third interval would start at 21:30? Then the third interval would be [21:30,22:46] (length=76 minutes). Then the minimum length would be min(75,76) = 75 minutes.

          But the sample output for the third interval is [21:31,22:46] -> length=75 minutes.

          Why 21:31? Maybe to make the minimum exactly 75 minutes? 

          Actually, the sample output has three intervals of 75 minutes each.

          How did they achieve that? 

          Total time: 22:46 - 19:00 = 3 hours 46 minutes = 226 minutes.
          Divided into 3 intervals: 226/3 = 75.333, so they cannot all be 76 minutes? 

          The minimum is 75 minutes.

          How to assign with contiguous intervals? 
            Let the breaks be at x and y.
            Interval0: [19:00, x] -> length = x - 1140
            Interval1: [x, y] -> length = y - x
            Interval2: [y,22:46] -> length = 1366 - y

            We want to maximize the minimum length, and we want to achieve at least 75 minutes for each.

            We also require:
              x >= 1200 (because the first interval must include [19:00,20:00] -> so x>=1200)
              y >= 1284 (because the second interval must include [21:08,21:24] -> so y>=1284? Actually, the second interval is [x,y] and must include [1268,1284] -> so x<=1268 and y>=1284? 
                But wait: condition 1: the amended interval must include the original. So for the second interval: we require x<=1268 and y>=1284.

            And the third interval: y<=1320 and 1366>=1366.

            How about:

              Let x = 1215 (19:00 to 20:15 = 75 minutes) -> satisfies x>=1200.
              Then the second interval: [1215, y] must be at least 75 minutes -> y = 1215+75=1290.
              Then the second interval: [1215,1290] includes [1268,1284]? 
                  1215<=1268 -> yes, 1290>=1284 -> yes.
              Then the third interval: [1290,1366] -> length=76 minutes.

            Then the minimum is 75 minutes.

            But the sample output for the second interval ends at 21:30 = 1290 minutes? 
               21:30 = 21*60+30 = 1260+30 = 1290.

            And the third interval starts at 21:31=1291 minutes? 
               Then the third interval: [1291,1366] = 75 minutes.

            How to get the third interval to start at 1291? 

            We are not required to be contiguous? Then we can set:

              Interval0: [1140, 1215]   (75 minutes)
              Interval1: [1215, 1290]   (75 minutes)
              Interval2: [1291, 1366]   (75 minutes)

            This is valid. 

            How to compute this in our propagation? 

            Our propagation (contiguous) would set:

              Interval2: [A2,1366] and we set A2 = min(1320,1366-75)=min(1320,1291)=1291? 
                 -> then we set the interval to [1291,1366] (75 minutes)
              Then interval1: 
                 B1 = A2 = 1291
                 A1 = min(1268, 1291-75)=min(1268,1216)=1216? 
                 Then the interval1: [1216,1291] -> length=75 minutes? But 1291-1216=75 minutes. 
                 But condition: the second interval must include [1268,1284] -> 1216<=1268 and 1291>=1284 -> yes.

              Then interval0:
                 B0 = A1 = 1216
                 A0 = min(1140, 1216-75)=min(1140,1141)=1140 -> then the interval0: [1140,1216] -> length=76 minutes.

            This yields:
                [1140,1216] -> 76 minutes
                [1216,1291] -> 75 minutes
                [1291,1366] -> 75 minutes

            Then the minimum is 75 minutes.

            This is valid.

            But the sample output has the first interval as [1140,1215] (75 minutes) and the second as [1215,1290] (75 minutes). 

            Why did we get 1216 for the first interval's end? 

            Because we set A1 = min(1268, 1291-75)=1216.

            How can we get 1215? 

            We require: 
              A1 = min(1268, 1291-75) = min(1268,1216)=1216.

            Then we cannot get 1215.

            But note: the sample output has a gap between the second and third interval? 

            In our propagation, we force the end of the second interval to be the start of the third interval. But the sample output has a gap, so the end of the second interval (21:30) is not the start of the third interval (21:31). 

            Our propagation is for contiguous intervals. 

            The problem: can we have non-contiguous intervals? 

            Yes, but our propagation (backward) for the feasibility check is for contiguous intervals? Then our solution will be contiguous.

            However, the problem does not require contiguous. So why do we use contiguous propagation? 

            Because it is a known technique to use the entire available time without gaps to maximize the minimum interval. And it works.

            And the sample input 1 with our propagation yields:

              Interval2: [1291,1366]  -> 75 minutes
              Interval1: [1216,1291]  -> 75 minutes
              Interval0: [1140,1216]  -> 76 minutes

            This has minimum 75 minutes, which is the same as the sample output.

            And it is valid.

            So we output:

              19:00 - 20:16   (1140 to 1216 -> 20:16)
              20:16 - 21:31   (1216 to 1291 -> 21:31)
              21:31 - 22:46   (1291 to 1366)

            But the sample output is:

              19:00 - 20:15
              20:15 - 21:30
              21:31 - 22:46

            Why the difference? 

            Because there are multiple solutions. 

            The problem: "if there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them"

            Therefore, we output the contiguous assignment.

            However, the sample output has a gap. 

            How did they get 20:15? 

            We can try to do a forward propagation? But the editorial says backward.

            Alternatively, we can do a forward propagation after fixing the contiguous assignment? 

            But our solution is valid.

 28. Therefore, we output the contiguous assignment.

 29. Code accordingly.

 30. Let's hope it passes.

 31. Note: the constraints: n<=200, and time in minutes (max 1439-960=479 minutes). Then the binary search runs in O(log(479)) which is about 10 iterations, and each feasibility O(n). So total 10*200=2000 operations.

 32. We'll code in C++.

 33. Implementation in C++:

        Steps:
          - Read n.
          - Read n lines, split by " - ".
          - Convert time string to minutes: 
                int to_minutes(string s) {
                    int h = stoi(s.substr(0,2));
                    int m = stoi(s.substr(3,2));
                    return h*60+m;
                }
          - Store s_list, e_list.

          - first_start = s_list[0], last_end = e_list[n-1].

          - Define feasible(L) function.

          - Binary search for the maximum L.

          - Then, for the optimal L, do the propagation (with clamping for indices 1..n-1) to compute A and B.

          - Convert A[i] and B[i] to string:

                string to_time(int m) {
                    int h = m/60;
                    int min = m%60;
                    char buf[10];
                    sprintf(buf, "%02d:%02d", h, min);
                    return string(buf);
                }

          - Output: 
                for i in range(n):
                    cout << to_time(A[i]) << " - " << to_time(B[i]) << endl;

 34. But note: the clamping for the last interval and intermediates might be not needed if the minutes are within [16:00, 23:59]? But the problem says the original intervals are within [16:00,23:59], but we might extend to earlier than 16:00 without clamping? 

 35. We do the clamping to ensure we stay within [16:00, 23:59].

 Let's code accordingly.
