 We are guaranteed that the solution exists.
 The idea: 
   We note that the entire matrix is given. However, we can reconstruct the tree by processing nodes from 2 to n.
   For node i (>=2), we look at the i-th row (0-indexed row i-1) and consider the values for columns 0 to i-2 (which correspond to nodes 1 to i-1).
   The parent of i must be the maximum value in the set { A_{i, j} for j in [1, i-1] }.

 Why?
   Since the tree is built by adding nodes in increasing order (we start with 1, then add 2, then 3, etc.), when we add node i, 
   the nodes 1 to i-1 are already in the tree. The condition for the edge (i, p) is that the minimum on the path from i to p is p? 
   Actually, note that the parent p must be one of the existing nodes. The path from i to p will consist of only i and p? Not necessarily, 
   but note: we are building the tree by connecting i to p. However, the recorded matrix A is for the entire tree we are going to form.

   Important: The matrix we are given is the one that the tree must satisfy. How does the parent relate?
   Consider the path from i to any existing node j. The minimum value on that path must be at least the minimum value in the entire path. 
   In particular, the path from i to p (the parent) must have the minimum value p? Why p? Because p is the parent and we are about to connect i to p.

   However, note the problem: the recorded value A_{i,j} for any j is the minimum label on the path from i to j. 
   Since the tree is built so far with nodes 1..i-1 and we are adding i, the path from i to j must go through p (the parent of i) and then the rest of the path from p to j.

   Therefore, the minimum value on the path from i to j is min(i, min_value_on_path(p->j)). But note: i is the largest node we have added so far (we are adding in increasing order). 
   So i is greater than all nodes from 1 to i-1. Thus, the minimum on the path from i to j is min(i, min_value_on_path(p->j)) = min_value_on_path(p->j) (since i is the largest).

   But wait: we are told that the recorded value for A_{i,j} is the minimum on the entire path. Therefore, A_{i,j} = min( i, A_{p,j} )? Actually, since i is the largest, it is A_{p,j}. 
   However, that does not hold if the parent p is not the minimum? 

   Let's reconsider: the entire path from i to j is [i, p, ... , j]. The minimum value on this path is min( i, min_value_on_path(p->j) ). 
   Since i is greater than all existing nodes (because we are adding in increasing order and existing nodes are 1..i-1), then the minimum on the path is min(i, min_value_on_path(p->j)) = min_value_on_path(p->j) [because min_value_on_path(p->j) <= p <= i-1 < i].

   Therefore, A_{i,j} = min_value_on_path(p->j) = A_{p,j}. 

   But note: the problem says that for the direct connection from i to p, the path from i to p has only two nodes: i and p. So the minimum is min(i, p). Since i>p, the minimum is p. 
   Therefore, we must have A_{i,p} = p.

   However, in our reasoning for j=p: A_{i,p} = A_{p,p}? But A_{p,p} is defined as the minimum on the path from p to p, which is p. So we have A_{i,p} = p.

   Now, consider j being any other node: we have A_{i,j} = A_{p,j}. 

   Therefore, the entire row for i (the i-th row) must be the same as the row for p, except for the diagonal? And also, we have A_{i,p} = p.

   But note: we also have A_{i,i}=i.

   How do we find the parent? 
   We know that for the parent p, A_{i,p} = p.
   Also, for any j, A_{i,j} = min( p, A_{p,j} )? Actually, no: the entire path from i to j goes through p, so the minimum is the minimum of i (which is bigger) and the minimum on the path from p to j. 
   And the minimum on the path from p to j is A_{p,j}. Therefore, A_{i,j} = min(i, A_{p,j}) = A_{p,j} (because i is the largest). 

   So the entire row of i must be the same as the row of p? But then how do we distinguish p? 

   However, note that we have the condition A_{i,p} = p. But if the row of i is the same as the row of p, then for j=p: A_{p,p}=p, so that matches. 

   But also for j=1: A_{i,1} = A_{p,1}. But we know A_{p,1}=1? Actually, yes because the minimum on the path from p to 1 must be 1 (since 1 is the smallest).

   Therefore, the row of i is exactly the row of p? Then how do we tell the parent? 

   Actually, the above reasoning is only valid if we assume that the parent p is such that the entire row i is the same as row p? But that is only true if the parent p is the same for all connections? 

   Alternatively, we can use the following: 
      The value A_{i,j} for any j must be at least the minimum label that appears in the entire path. But note that the minimum label in the entire path from i to j is the minimum label in the path from p to j? 
      So A_{i,j} = A_{p,j}. 

   Therefore, the row i must be identical to the row p? 

   But look at the sample input 2:
        n=6
        Row for node 1: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
        Row for node 2: [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]   -> then row for node 3: [1,2,3,2,2,2] -> but note: row 2 (index1) and row 3 (index2) are not the same.

   However, in the row for node 3 (which is the third row, index2): 
        A_{3,1} = 1 -> which is A_{2,1}=1? yes.
        A_{3,2} = 2 -> which is A_{2,2}=2? yes.
        A_{3,3}=3 -> not in row2? 
        A_{3,4}=2 -> and A_{2,4}=2? yes.
        A_{3,5}=2 -> and A_{2,5}=2? yes.
        A_{3,6}=2 -> and A_{2,6}=2? yes.

   So for j != 3, we have A_{3,j} = A_{2,j}. 

   Therefore, the row for i is the same as the row for p for all j that are not i? And for j=i, we have A_{i,i}=i.

   How do we use this to find the parent?
   We note that the parent p must satisfy: 
        For all j in the current tree (which is 1..i-1), A_{i,j} = A_{p,j}. 
        And also A_{i,p} = p.

   But note: if we look at the row for i (without the diagonal element for i) then the entire row for j in [0, i-1] (0-indexed) must be the same as the row for p? 
   However, we don't have the parent p yet. 

   Alternate insight from the editorial guidelines: 
        The parent of i is the maximum value in the i-th row for the columns corresponding to the existing nodes (1 to i-1). 

   Why? 
        Since the parent p must be such that A_{i,p}=p. 
        Also, for any other node j, A_{i,j}=A_{p,j} and since the parent p is in the existing set, we are looking for the maximum p for which A_{i,p}=p.

        But note: the value p must be one of the values in the row for i (in the columns 0 to i-2). 
        And the condition A_{i,j} = A_{p,j} for all j is automatically satisfied if we choose the parent as the maximum value? 

        Actually, we don't need to check the entire row because the problem guarantees a solution. 

        Why maximum? 
          Consider: if there are multiple candidates p that satisfy A_{i,p}=p, then which one to choose?
          Suppose we choose a candidate p0. Then the entire row for i must be the same as the row for p0? 
          But if there is a candidate p1 that is greater than p0 and also satisfies A_{i,p1}=p1, then note that the path from i to p1 must go through the parent. 
          However, if p1 is in the tree and not the parent, then the path from i to p1 must go through the parent and then to p1. Then the minimum on the path from i to p1 would be min(i, parent, ... , p1). 
          But the parent is less than i and p1? Not necessarily: we are adding in increasing order, so the parent is less than i, but p1 might be greater than the parent? 

          Actually, if p1 is the parent then we are done. But if we have two candidates: 
            candidate p0 and candidate p1 (with p1>p0) and both satisfy A_{i,p0}=p0 and A_{i,p1}=p1.
          Then consider the path from i to p1: it must have a minimum value p1? 
          But the path from i to p0 must have minimum value p0.

          How can both be true? 
          The path from i to p1 must go through p0? Because the tree is built on 1..i-1. But if p0 and p1 are in the existing tree, then the path from p0 to p1 exists. 
          Then the path from i to p1 is i -> ... -> p0 -> ... -> p1. The minimum on this path is min(i, ... , p0, ... , p1). Since p0 < p1, then the minimum is at most p0. 
          But we require that the minimum is p1? which is greater than p0 -> contradiction.

          Therefore, there can be at most one candidate p that satisfies A_{i,p}=p and that candidate must be the maximum value in the row (for the existing nodes) because any candidate must be at most the parent? 

          Actually, the parent must be the candidate that is the largest? 

          Why? The parent must be the one that is the closest to the root? 

          Alternatively, note that the minimum value on the entire path from i to j for any j must be at least the minimum value in the entire tree? But we know the smallest is 1.

          But in the existing tree, the node with the highest label that is adjacent to i must be the parent? 

          Actually, the above contradiction shows that there can be only one candidate. Why? 
            Suppose there are two distinct candidates p0 and p1 (both in the existing tree) such that A_{i,p0}=p0 and A_{i,p1}=p1. 
            Then the path from p0 to p1 in the tree has a minimum value, say m. Then the path from i to p0 is [i, ... , p0] and the path from i to p1 is [i, ... , p1]. 
            The entire path from p0 to p1 is contained in the tree. The path from i to p1 must go through the path from p0 to p1? 
            Actually, the entire tree is connected. The path from i to p1 must go through the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of p0 and p1. 

            The minimum value on the path from i to p1 is min( min_value_on_path(i->LCA), min_value_on_path(LCA->p1) ). 
            Similarly, for i to p0: min( min_value_on_path(i->LCA), min_value_on_path(LCA->p0) ). 

            But note: the entire path from i to LCA must have a minimum value that is at most the LCA? 

            However, we have A_{i,p1}=p1. This implies that p1 must appear on the path and also that every node on the path from i to p1 is at least p1? That is not possible because the LCA might be less than p1? 

            Specifically, if the LCA is less than p1, then the minimum value would be at most the LCA, which is less than p1, contradicting A_{i,p1}=p1. 

            Therefore, the entire path from i to p1 must have all nodes >= p1. But the existing tree has nodes 1 to i-1. The only node that is at least p1 and also in the path must be p1? 

            How can the entire path have all nodes >= p1? Then the minimum would be p1? 

            But note: the node i is greater than p1? (since we are adding in increasing order and p1 is in 1..i-1, so p1 <= i-1 < i). So the path from i to p1: 
                i (which is > p1) and then ... and then p1. The minimum must be p1 only if p1 is the smallest node on the path. 

            Now, if the LCA is less than p1, then the LCA would be the minimum? which is less than p1 -> contradiction.

            Therefore, the LCA must be p1? Similarly, the LCA must be p0? -> so p0=p1.

          Hence, there is exactly one candidate? 

        However, note: we don't require the entire path to have all nodes >= p1? We only know that the minimum is p1. The path might have a node that is p1 and that is the minimum. 

        But if the LCA is not p1, then there is a node on the path from LCA to p1 that is less than p1? Then that node would be the minimum? 

        Therefore, the condition A_{i,p1}=p1 forces that the entire path from i to p1 must not have any node less than p1? 

        Actually, if there were a node less than p1, then that node would be the minimum? But we require the minimum to be p1. So the entire path must be >= p1. 

        Similarly, the entire path from i to p0 must be >= p0. 

        Now, consider the path from p0 to p1: it must be contained in the existing tree. The path from i to p0 and i to p1 must share the segment from i to the LCA. 

        Then the path from i to LCA must be >= min(p0,p1)? 

        But if p0 != p1, say p0 < p1, then the path from i to p1 must go through the LCA and then to p1. The segment from LCA to p1 must be >= p1? because the entire path must be >= p1. 
        Similarly, the segment from LCA to p0 must be >= p0? 

        But note: the LCA itself must be >= p1? because it is on the path from i to p1. 

        Now, the path from p0 to p1: the segment from LCA to p0 must be >= p0, and the segment from LCA to p1 must be >= p1. 

        But what about the LCA? It must be at least p1? 

        Now, consider the node p0: it is in the existing tree and is less than p1. The path from i to p0 must go through the LCA (which is at least p1) and then to p0. 
        But then the node p0 is in the path? and p0 < p1 <= LCA? so the minimum on the path from i to p0 would be at most p0? 
        But we require it to be p0? 

        So the minimum is p0? Then the path must have a node with value p0? and that is the minimum? 

        But we also have that the segment from i to LCA is at least p1 (which is > p0) and the segment from LCA to p0 is at least p0? 
        Then the minimum is p0? So that condition is satisfied. 

        However, the condition for the path from i to p1: the minimum must be p1. 
        The entire path is: i (which is > p1), then ... (nodes >= p1) until LCA, then from LCA to p1 (nodes >= p1). Therefore, the minimum is at least p1. 
        And since p1 is on the path, the minimum is p1. 

        So both conditions are satisfied? 

        But then we have two candidates? 

        Then how do we choose the parent? 

        Actually, the parent must be the candidate that is adjacent to i? 

        How do we know which one is adjacent? 

        The problem: we are reconstructing the tree. 

        However, note that if we have two candidates p0 and p1 (with p0 < p1), then the parent of i must be the one that is the LCA of the two? Or not? 

        Actually, the parent is the direct neighbor of i. 

        But the above scenario does not break the condition? 

        However, consider the path from i to p0: 
            The parent of i is, say, q. Then the path is i -> q -> ... -> p0. 
            Then the minimum on the path from i to p0 is min(i, q, ... , p0). Since i is the largest, and q is in 1..i-1, the minimum is min(q, ... , p0). 
            We require that to be p0? 
            But if q is not p0, then the path from q to p0 might have a node smaller than p0? 

        Actually, if we choose the parent arbitrarily as one of the candidates, then the condition for the other candidate might fail? 

        Therefore, we must have only one candidate? 

        How do we break the tie? 

        The editorial says: the parent is the maximum value in the row for the existing nodes. 

        Why maximum? 
          Because the parent must be the candidate that is the highest? 

        Actually, note: the entire path from i to any node j must have a minimum value that is the minimum value in the entire path. 
        The parent must be the first node we connect to. 

        Now, consider: if we choose the parent as the maximum candidate, then for any other candidate p0 (which is less than the parent p), the path from i to p0 goes through the parent p and then from p to p0. 
        The minimum on the path is min( min(i, p), min_value_on_path(p->p0) ) = min(p, min_value_on_path(p->p0)). 
        Since p is the parent and we are in the existing tree, the path from p to p0 has a minimum value which is at most p? 

        But we require that the minimum for the path from i to p0 is p0? 
        Then we must have min(p, min_value_on_path(p->p0)) = p0. 
        Since p0 < p, we require min_value_on_path(p->p0)=p0. 

        But that is true because the existing tree already satisfies the condition: the path from p to p0 has minimum p0? 

        Why? Because the existing tree (nodes 1 to i-1) already satisfies the condition: the matrix for the existing nodes is consistent. 

        Therefore, if we choose the parent as the maximum candidate, then for every other candidate p0 (which is less than the parent p), we have min_value_on_path(p->p0)=p0? 

        But note: the existing tree for nodes 1 to i-1 already has the property that the minimum on the path from p to p0 is A_{p,p0}. 
        And we are given the matrix. For the row of i, we have A_{i,p0} = p0? (because p0 is a candidate). 

        But in the existing tree, the path from p to p0 has minimum value A_{p,p0}. 
        We require A_{p,p0}=p0? 

        Why? Because we are going to use the row of the parent to match the row of i? 

        Actually, we have not enforced that. 

        However, note the problem guarantees a solution. 

        Therefore, we can rely on the following: 
          The parent of i is the maximum value in the i-th row (for columns 0 to i-2, i.e., nodes 1 to i-1). 

        Why? Because the maximum value in the row for existing nodes must be the parent? 

        Example: Sample Input 2: 
            Row for node 6: [1,2,2,2,2,6] -> for existing nodes 1 to 5: the values are [1,2,2,2,2]. The maximum is 2. 
            Therefore, the parent of 6 is 2. 

        But note: the diagonal element (A_{6,6}) is 6, which we ignore.

        Therefore, algorithm:
            for i from 2 to n:
                parent = max( matrix[i-1][0 : i-1] )   # because the row for node i (0-indexed row i-1) and we consider the first i-1 elements (which correspond to nodes 1 to i-1, because the matrix is given for j from 1 to n, and the first element is j=1, then j=2, ...)
                Then add edge (min(i, parent), max(i, parent))

        However, note: the matrix is given such that the i-th row (0-indexed) corresponds to the starting town i? 
        The problem says: the i-th line contains A_{i,1}, A_{i,2}, ... A_{i,N}. 

        Therefore, matrix[i-1][j-1] is A_{i,j}. 

        For the row of node i, the elements for j=1 to i-1 are at indices j=0 to i-2? 

        So we take the slice [0:i-1] of the row.

        Then we take the maximum in that slice.

        But note: the diagonal element for node i is at j=i-1 (if we consider 0-indexed: j = i-1) because j=i is the i-th element (0-indexed index i-1). 
        We do not include j=i (the diagonal) because we are only considering existing nodes 1 to i-1.

        However, the row we have for node i has the values for j=1 to j=i? and then j=i+1? ... 
        Actually, the row has n elements: indices 0 to n-1, corresponding to j=1 to j=n.

        So for node i, the existing nodes are j=1 to j=i-1 -> we consider indices 0 to i-2 (0-indexed).

        Example: i=2 -> existing nodes: j=1 -> index0. 
                 i=3 -> existing nodes: j=1 and j=2 -> indices0 and 1.

        But note: the sample input 2 for node 6 (i=6) -> row: [1,2,2,2,2,6] -> existing nodes 1 to 5: indices0 to 4: [1,2,2,2,2] -> max=2.

        Then we add edge (min(6,2), max(6,2)) = (2,6).

        Then we output the edges.

        However, the sample output for input2 is:
            2 3
            2 4
            2 5
            2 6
            1 2

        How do we get the edge (1,2)? 
          When i=2: 
             row for node2: [1,2,2,2,2,2] -> but note: for i=2, we consider existing nodes 1 to 1 -> index0: value is 1 (which is A_{2,1}).
             then parent = max([1]) = 1.
             then edge (min(2,1), max(2,1)) = (1,2).

        Then for i=3: 
             row for node3: [1,2,3,2,2,2] -> existing nodes 1 to 2: indices0 and 1: [1,2] -> max=2 -> edge (2,3).

        Then for i=4: 
             row for node4: [1,2,2,4,2,2] -> existing nodes 1 to 3: indices0,1,2: [1,2,2] -> max=2 -> edge (2,4).

        Then for i=5: 
             row for node5: [1,2,2,2,5,2] -> existing nodes 1 to 4: indices0,1,2,3: [1,2,2,2] -> max=2 -> edge (2,5).

        Then for i=6: 
             row for node6: [1,2,2,2,2,6] -> existing nodes 1 to 5: indices0,1,2,3,4: [1,2,2,2,2] -> max=2 -> edge (2,6).

        Then we have edges: (1,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). 

        How to output? The problem does not require a specific order, but the sample output is:

            2 3
            2 4
            2 5
            2 6
            1 2

        But note: the sample output has the edge (1,2) last. 

        The problem says: Output N-1 lines, each with two space-separated integers.

        However, the sample output has the edge (1,2) last. 

        Why? The problem does not specify the order. But the sample output writes the edges in a particular order: 
          edges that are incident to a higher node first? 

        Actually, the sample output for the first sample is:
            2 1
            3 1

        But our algorithm for the first sample:
          n=3
          i=2: row for node2: [1,1,1] -> the first element (j=1) is at index0: [1] -> max=1 -> edge (min(2,1)=1, max(2,1)=2 -> (1,2)
          i=3: row for node3: [1,1,3] -> existing nodes 1 and 2: indices0 and 1: [1,1] -> max=1 -> edge (1,3)

        Then we have edges (1,2) and (1,3). 

        But the sample output is:
            2 1
            3 1

        So we can output the edges in any order? 

        However, the sample output for the second sample has the edge (1,2) last.

        To match the sample output, we can sort the edges? 

        The sample output for the first sample: 
            edge1: 2 1 -> which is (2,1) -> but we have (1,2) -> we can output as min then max? 
            But note: the problem does not require the order of the two nodes in the edge. 
            However, the sample output writes the edge (2,1) meaning that the larger node is written first? 

        Actually, the first sample output: 
            2 1 -> meaning they wrote the larger node first? 
            3 1 -> again the larger node first? 

        Then for the second sample: 
            We have edges: 
                (1,2) -> then if we output as (2,1) that would be larger first? 
                (2,3) -> output as (3,2)? but the sample output writes (2,3) for the first edge.

        Actually, the second sample output:
            2 3
            2 4
            2 5
            2 6
            1 2   -> this edge is written as (1,2) which is the reverse of (2,1) and also the first edges are written as (2,3) meaning they wrote the smaller node first? 

        How to explain? 

        The problem does not specify the order of the two nodes in an edge, and the edges can be output in any order? 

        But the sample outputs:

          Sample1: 
            Output: 
                2 1
                3 1

          Sample2:
            Output:
                2 3
                2 4
                2 5
                2 6
                1 2

        In sample1: 
            The edges are (1,2) and (1,3) but they output as (2,1) and (3,1). 
            So they output: 
                first node: the non-1 node, then 1? 

        In sample2:
            The edges are (1,2) and (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). 
            They output the edges (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6) first and then (1,2). 

        Therefore, they output the edges that are not incident to 1 first? and then the edge incident to 1? 

        Actually, we can output the edges in any order? 

        But the problem says: "Output N-1 lines, each with two space-separated integers A_i B_i"

        And the sample outputs are different. 

        How to match? 

        We note that the problem does not require a specific order of edges. 

        However, to match the sample outputs, we can output the edges in the following order:
          Sort the edges: 
            by min(u,v) in descending order, and then by max(u,v) in ascending order? 

          For sample1: 
            edge1: (1,2) -> min=1, max=2 -> key: (-min, max) = (-1,2)
            edge2: (1,3) -> min=1, max=3 -> key: (-1,3)

            Then if we sort: 
                (-1,2) and (-1,3): same -min, then sort by max: so (2,?) first then (3,?) -> but wait, we have two edges with the same min? 

            Actually, we want the edge (1,2) and (1,3) to be output as (2,1) and (3,1) meaning we write the larger node first? 
            But the problem does not require the order of the two nodes. 

          Alternatively, we can output each edge as (min, max) or (max, min)? 

          The sample output for sample1: 
               2 1 -> meaning: first the larger node, then the smaller? 
               3 1 -> same.

          For sample2: 
            The edge (1,2): we output as 1 2? or 2 1? 
            The sample output writes it as "1 2" at the last line? 
            But the other edges: (2,3) -> output as 2 3? meaning: smaller node first? 

          Actually, the sample output for sample2 writes:
                2 3   -> min=2, max=3 -> so we write min then max.
                2 4
                2 5
                2 6
                1 2   -> min=1, max=2 -> so we write min then max.

          But for sample1, the sample output writes:
                2 1 -> but here min=1, max=2 -> so they wrote max then min? 
                3 1 -> same.

          This is inconsistent.

        After re-examining the problem statement: 
          "Output N-1 lines, each with two space-separated integers A_i B_i"

        And the sample outputs are as given.

        How did the sample output for sample1 become 2 1 and 3 1? 
          In the input sample1: 
            The matrix:
                1 1 1 
                1 2 1 
                1 1 3 

          The solution: 
            Edge1: 2-1 -> so that's (2,1)
            Edge2: 3-1 -> so that's (3,1)

        How about we output the edges as we computed: (1,2) and (1,3) but then we output each edge as (v, u) for (u,v) if u is the parent? 

        Actually, we computed the parent for each node. 
          For node2: parent=1 -> so we have edge (1,2) but we can output as (2,1) meaning the child first then the parent? 
          For node3: parent=1 -> output (3,1)

        Then the output for sample2: 
            node2: parent=1 -> output (2,1) -> but the sample output has (1,2) at the last? 

        Alternatively, we can output the edge as (min, max) for all? 
          Then for (1,2): output "1 2"
          for (1,3): output "1 3"

        But the sample output for sample1 is "2 1" and "3 1", which is the same as (max, min) for each edge? 

        How about we output the edge as (max, min) for the entire list? 
          Then for sample1: 
              edge (1,2): max=2, min=1 -> "2 1"
              edge (1,3): "3 1"

          For sample2: 
              edge (1,2): "2 1" -> but the sample output has "1 2" at the last? 

        The sample output for sample2: 
             2 3
             2 4
             2 5
             2 6
             1 2

        How about we output the edges that are incident to 1 last? 

        We can collect all edges and then sort: 
          We want: 
            For edges that are incident to 1: we output them last? 
            And for an edge (u, v): 
                if the edge is not incident to 1, then output as (min, max) -> so for (2,3): min=2, max=3 -> "2 3"
                if the edge is incident to 1, then output as (max, min) -> so (1,2) becomes "2 1" -> but then that would be "2 1", but the sample output for sample2 has "1 2" at the last.

        Actually, the sample output for sample2 writes the edge (1,2) as "1 2", meaning min then max? 

        Therefore, to be consistent: 
          For every edge, we output the smaller number first? 
          Then for sample1: 
                edge (1,2) -> "1 2"
                edge (1,3) -> "1 3"
          But the sample output for sample1 is "2 1" and "3 1". 

        The problem sample input and output:

          Input1:
              3
              1 1 1 
              1 2 1 
              1 1 3 

          Output1:
              2 1
              3 1

        So they did not output in the min then max order? 

        After reading the problem statement: the sample output is:

          Sample Output #1
              2 1
              3 1

        So we must output exactly that? 

        How can we do that? 
          We note that the problem does not require a specific order of the edges, but the sample outputs are given. 

        Since the problem says: "Output N-1 lines, each with two space-separated integers A_i B_i", 
        and the sample outputs are as above, we can output the edges in any order and the two nodes in any order? 

        But the judge might be sensitive to the order of the two nodes and the order of the edges? 

        Actually, the sample output for sample2: 
            "2 3
             2 4
             2 5
             2 6
             1 2"

        This is: 
            For edges that are not incident to 1: we output the parent (which is 2) first and then the child? 
            For the edge incident to 1: we output 1 first then 2? 

        How about: 
          For an edge (u, v) that we built: 
            We know that u is the parent and v is the child? But wait: we built the tree by setting the parent for each node. 
            For node i, we set parent = p. Then the edge is between i and p. 
            Then we can output the edge as "p i" for every edge? 

          Then for sample1: 
                node2: parent=1 -> output "1 2"
                node3: parent=1 -> output "1 3"

          But the sample output is "2 1" and "3 1", which is the reverse.

        Alternatively, output the edge as "i p" for every edge? 
          Then for sample1: 
                node2: output "2 1"
                node3: output "3 1" -> matches.

          For sample2: 
                node2: output "2 1"
                node3: output "3 2"
                node4: output "4 2"
                node5: output "5 2"
                node6: output "6 2"

          But the sample output is:
                2 3
                2 4
                2 5
                2 6
                1 2

          This does not match.

        How about: 
          For the edge (u, v) = (min(i, parent), max(i, parent))? 
          But we did not store the parent as the first node? 

        Actually, we stored the edge as (min(i, parent), max(i, parent))? 
          Then we output as (min, max) for each edge? 

        Then for sample1: 
            edge for node2: (min(2,1), max(2,1)) = (1,2) -> output "1 2"
            edge for node3: (1,3) -> output "1 3"

        But sample output is "2 1" and "3 1". 

        Or if we output as (max, min): 
            (2,1) and (3,1) -> matches sample1.

        Then for sample2: 
            node2: edge = (min(2,1), max(2,1)) = (1,2) -> output as (2,1) -> but the sample output has "1 2" at the last? 

        How about we sort the list of edges? 
          We have edges: 
            node2: (1,2) -> represented as (2,1) [if we use (max,min) for output]
            node3: (2,3) -> (min=2, max=3) -> if we output as (max,min) then (3,2) -> but the sample output writes (2,3).

        Therefore, we decide: 
          We will output each edge as (max, min) for sample1? 
          But for sample2, we want the edge (1,2) to be output as "1 2" at the last? 

        Alternatively, we can output the edges in the order of increasing parent? or by the child? 

        We can collect the edges and then sort them by the child? 
          In sample1: 
                edge for node2: child=2 -> output as (2,1)
                edge for node3: child=3 -> output as (3,1)

          Then the output: 
                2 1
                3 1   -> matches.

          In sample2: 
                node2: child=2 -> edge (2,1) -> output as (2,1) -> but we want to output as "1 2" at the last? 
                node3: child=3 -> edge (3,2) -> output as (3,2) -> but the sample output writes (2,3).

        Then we output the edge for child i as (i, parent). 
          Then for sample2: 
                node2: (2,1)
                node3: (3,2)
                node4: (4,2)
                node5: (5,2)
                node6: (6,2)

          Then we have: 
                (2,1)
                (3,2)
                (4,2)
                (5,2)
                (6,2)

          But the sample output is:
                2 3
                2 4
                2 5
                2 6
                1 2

        How can we get the sample output? 
          We note that the sample output does not write the edges as (child, parent). 

        After re-examining the sample output for sample2: 
            The edges are written as:
                2 3  -> this is an edge between 2 and 3, and 2 is the parent of 3? 
                2 4
                2 5
                2 6
                1 2  -> edge between 1 and 2, and 1 is the parent of 2.

          So the tree: 
                1 is the parent of 2, and 2 is the parent of 3,4,5,6.

          Then the output order: 
                first the edges from 2 to its children (in increasing order of the child) and then the edge from 1 to 2.

        How to achieve? 
          We can output the edges in the order of increasing parent, and then for the same parent, increasing child? 
          But we want the edge from 1 to 2 to be last? 

          Actually, we can sort the edges by the parent (in increasing order) and then by the child (in increasing order). 
          Then the edges: 
                (1,2): parent=1, child=2
                (2,3): parent=2, child=3
                (2,4): parent=2, child=4
                (2,5): parent=2, child=5
                (2,6): parent=2, child=6

          Then if we output in this sorted order: 
                first: parent=1 -> (1,2) -> but we want to output as "1 2" or "2 1"?

          The sample output writes the edge (1,2) as "1 2" at the last? 

          How about we sort by parent in descending order? 
                parent=2: then we have 4 edges: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6) -> then sort by child: 3,4,5,6 -> output: 
                    2 3
                    2 4
                    2 5
                    2 6
                then parent=1: (1,2) -> output: 1 2

          That matches.

          How to represent the edge? 
            We have an edge (u, v) that we built: 
                For an edge between i and parent: 
                    We know that the parent is the parent and i is the child? 
                Then we can store: 
                    parent_value = parent
                    child_value = i

          Then we have the edge: (parent, child) = (p, i)

          Then we can sort: 
                by parent (in descending order) and then by child (in ascending order)? 

          Then output: 
                for edge (p, i): we output as "p i" -> meaning the parent first then the child? 

          Then for sample1: 
                edges: 
                    (1,2): parent=1, child=2
                    (1,3): parent=1, child=3
                sort by parent descending: both have parent=1 -> then by child: 2 then 3 -> output:
                    1 2
                    1 3

          But the sample output is "2 1" and "3 1". 

        Therefore, we must output the edge as "child parent" for each edge? 
          Then for sample1: 
                (1,2) -> output "2 1"
                (1,3) -> output "3 1"

          Then sort: 
                by parent? but we are storing the parent as the first element? 

          Actually, we stored the edge as (parent, child). 
          We want to output as (child, parent). 
          Then we can output: 
                for the edge (p, i): output (i, p)

          Then sort the list of edges (each represented as (i, p)) by p descending and then by i ascending? 
          For sample1: 
                edge1: (2,1) -> p=1
                edge2: (3,1) -> p=1
                sort by p (descending): 1 is the same -> then by i: 2 then 3 -> 
                    output: 
                        2 1
                        3 1 -> matches.

          For sample2: 
                node2: (2,1) -> represented as (child=2, parent=1) -> (2,1) -> but wait, we are representing as (i, p) so for node2: i=2, p=1 -> (2,1)
                node3: (3,2) -> (3,2)
                node4: (4,2) -> (4,2)
                node5: (5,2) -> (5,2)
                node6: (6,2) -> (6,2)

                Now, we sort by the parent (which is the second element) in descending order, and then by the child (first element) in ascending order? 
                For (2,1): parent=1 -> 
                For the others: parent=2 -> 

                Then we first output the edges with parent=2: 
                    sort by child: 3,4,5,6 -> 
                        3 2
                        4 2
                        5 2
                        6 2
                then the edge with parent=1: 
                        2 1

                But the sample output is:
                    2 3
                    2 4
                    2 5
                    2 6
                    1 2

                This does not match: we output "3 2", ... and "2 1", but the sample output writes "2 3", meaning the parent first? 

        Alternatively, we can output the edge as (p, i) and then sort by p descending, then i ascending, and then output each edge as (p, i)? 
          Then for sample1: 
                (1,2) and (1,3) -> sorted: (1,2) then (1,3) -> then output: 
                    "1 2"
                    "1 3" -> does not match sample output.

        Or output the edge as (i, p) and then sort by p descending, then i ascending, and then output as (i, p) -> meaning we write the child first then the parent? 
          Then for sample2: 
                (2,1): p=1 -> last
                (3,2): p=2 -> first
                (4,2)
                (5,2)
                (6,2)
                Then the output: 
                    3 2
                    4 2
                    5 2
                    6 2
                    2 1

          But the sample output for sample2: 
                2 3   -> this is an edge between 2 and 3, but we output as 3 2? 
                2 4
                2 5
                2 6
                1 2   -> we output as 2 1? 

        The problem does not require a specific order of the two nodes in the edge? 

        However, the sample output writes the edge between 2 and 3 as "2 3", meaning they do not care the direction? 

        But the graph is undirected. 

        Therefore, we can output the two nodes in any order. 

        But then we are free to output as (3,2) for the edge between 2 and 3? 

        However, the sample output for sample2 writes "2 3", not "3 2". 

        How about: 
          For each edge (u, v) that we built (without parent-child direction), we output the smaller node first? 
          Then for the edge (2,3): output "2 3"
          for the edge (2,4): "2 4"
          for the edge (1,2): "1 2"

          Then we sort the list of edges? 
          How to sort? 
          We want the edge (1,2) to be last? 

          We can sort by the minimum node in the edge in descending order? 
            edge (2,3): min=2, max=3 -> key: (-2, 3)
            edge (2,4): min=2, max=4 -> key: (-2,4)
            edge (2,5): min=2, max=5
            edge (2,6): min=2, max=6
            edge (1,2): min=1, max=2 -> key: (-1,2)

          Then sorted: 
            first: (-2,3), (-2,4), (-2,5), (-2,6) -> sorted by the second: 3,4,5,6 -> so output: 
                2 3
                2 4
                2 5
                2 6
            then: (-1,2) -> output 1 2

          This matches sample2.

          For sample1: 
                edges: 
                    (1,2): min=1, max=2 -> key: (-1,2)
                    (1,3): min=1, max=3 -> key: (-1,3)
                sorted: 
                    first: (-1,2) -> output "1 2" -> but sample output is "2 1", which is the same as (max,min) representation.

          But note: the problem says the edge is undirected. 
          We decided to output the edge as (min, max) for each edge? 
          Then for (1,2): we output "1 2" or "2 1"? 

          The sample output for sample1 is "2 1" and "3 1", meaning they output the larger node first? 

          How about we output each edge as (max, min)? 
          Then for sample1: 
                edge (1,2): (2,1)
                edge (1,3): (3,1)
                Then sort by key: 
                    for (2,1): min=1, max=2 -> key: (-1,2) -> same as for (3,1): (-1,3)
                Then output: 
                    (2,1) then (3,1) -> matches sample1.

          For sample2: 
                edge (1,2): (2,1) -> min=1, max=2 -> key: (-1,2)
                edge (2,3): (3,2) -> min=2, max=3 -> key: (-2,3)
                edge (2,4): (4,2) -> (-2,4)
                edge (2,5): (5,2) -> (-2,5)
                edge (2,6): (6,2) -> (-2,6)

                Then sort by the key: 
                    (-1,2) -> then the others: (-2,3), (-2,4), (-2,5), (-2,6) -> but -1 is greater than -2? 
                    So we output first the edge (2,1) and then the others? 

                But the sample output for sample2 has the edge (1,2) last.

          Therefore, we want to output the edge with the larger min value first? 
          Actually, the key we defined is (-min, max). 
          Then for min=2: key = (-2, max) -> and we want to output the edges with min=2 before min=1? 

          How about we sort by the key: (-min, max) in the natural order: 
                (-1,2) and (-2,3): 
                -1 > -2 -> so (-1,2) comes first? 

          But we want the edge with min=2 to come first? 

          Then we can sort by -min in descending order? which is the same as min in ascending order? 

          Alternatively, sort by min in descending order, then by max in ascending order? 
          Then for sample2: 
                min=2: edges (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6): 
                    sort by max: 3,4,5,6 -> 
                then min=1: edge (1,2) -> 
                Then output: 
                    2 3
                    2 4
                    2 5
                    2 6
                    1 2   -> but if we output each edge as (min, max) then we output "2 3", meaning (min, max) -> then for (1,2): "1 2"

          This matches sample2.

          For sample1: 
                edge (1,2): min=1, max=2 -> 
                edge (1,3): min=1, max=3 -> 
                sort by min descending: 1 and 1 -> then by max ascending: 2 then 3 -> 
                output: 
                    1 2
                    1 3

          But the sample output for sample1 is "2 1" and "3 1". 

        Therefore, to match both samples, we do:
          For each edge (u, v) that we built (which is between i and parent) -> we don't care, we have an undirected edge.
          We represent the edge as (min, max) = (min(u,v), max(u,v))

          Then we collect the edges.

          Then we sort the list of edges by:
             primary: min (the minimum node) in descending order.
             secondary: max (the maximum node) in ascending order.

          Then for each edge in the sorted list, we output the edge as (min, max) for sample2? 
          But for sample1, we want to output as (max, min)? 

          How about we output the edge as (max, min) for every edge? 
          Then for sample1: 
                edge1: (min=1, max=2) -> output (2,1)
                edge2: (min=1, max=3) -> output (3,1)
          Then sorted: 
                by min descending: both min=1 -> then by max ascending: 2 then 3 -> 
                output: 
                    2 1
                    3 1 -> matches sample1.

          For sample2: 
                edge (1,2): min=1, max=2 -> output (2,1)
                edge (2,3): min=2, max=3 -> output (3,2)
                edge (2,4): output (4,2)
                edge (2,5): (5,2)
                edge (2,6): (6,2)

                Then sort by min descending: 
                    min=2: edges (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2) -> then min=1: (2,1)
                Then within min=2, sort by max ascending: 3,4,5,6 -> 
                    output: 
                        3 2
                        4 2
                        5 2
                        6 2
                        2 1

          But the sample output for sample2 is:
                2 3
                2 4
                2 5
                2 6
                1 2

          Which is not the same as (3,2) etc.

        How about we output the edge as (min, max) for sample2? 
          Then for the edge (1,2): output "1 2"
          for (2,3): "2 3"

          Then sort by min descending: 
                min=2: edges: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6) -> sorted by max: 3,4,5,6 -> output:
                    2 3
                    2 4
                    2 5
                    2 6
                min=1: (1,2) -> output 1 2

          This matches sample2.

          But sample1: 
                output: 
                    1 2
                    1 3   -> but sample output is "2 1" and "3 1"

        Therefore, we have to do:

          We output the edge in two different ways for the two samples? 

        We must decide: 
          The problem: the sample outputs are different. 
          How can we satisfy both? 

        Insight: 
          The problem does not require the order of the edges, nor the order of the two nodes in an edge. 
          But the sample outputs are provided as examples.

          After reading the problem statement: it says "Output N-1 lines, each with two space-separated integers A_i B_i"

          And the sample outputs are accepted.

          Therefore, we can choose one representation that satisfies:

            For sample1: output 
                2 1
                3 1

            For sample2: output 
                2 3
                2 4
                2 5
                2 6
                1 2

          How? 
            We can output each edge as (max, min) for sample1 and (min, max) for sample2? 
            But we don't know which sample it is.

        Alternatively, we can output every edge as (min, max) and then sort by min descending and then max ascending? 
          This matches sample2.

          But sample1: 
                edges: 
                  (1,2): output "1 2"
                  (1,3): output "1 3"
                sorted by min descending: both min=1 -> then by max ascending: 2 then 3 -> 
                output: 
                    "1 2"
                    "1 3"

          But expected sample1 output: "2 1" and "3 1"

        Or output every edge as (max, min) and then sort by min descending and then max ascending? 
          For an edge (u,v): 
                (min_edge, max_edge) = (min(u,v), max(u,v))
                then we output (max_edge, min_edge) = (max, min)

          Then for sample1: 
                edge (1,2): output (2,1)
                edge (1,3): output (3,1)
                then sort: 
                    min_edge = min(2,1)=1 for the first edge? 
                    But note: in the edge representation for sorting, we are not using the (min,max) of the edge for sorting? 
                    We are using the original (min, max) = (1,2) and (1,3) for the purpose of sorting? 

          We have an alternative: 
            When we store the edge, we store the two endpoints as (u, v) and we compute:
                a = min(u,v)
                b = max(u,v)
            Then we store the edge as (a, b) for the purpose of sorting.

            Then we sort the list of (a, b) by:
                a (which is the min) in descending order, 
                then b (which is the max) in ascending order.

            Then for each stored (a,b), we output: 
                Option1: output (a, b)  -> then sample2 is matched, sample1 outputs (1,2) and (1,3) -> not matched.
                Option2: output (b, a)  -> then sample1: (2,1) and (3,1) -> matched, but sample2: 
                    edge (1,2): stored as (1,2) -> output (2,1)
                    edge (2,3): stored as (2,3) -> output (3,2) -> not matched.

        How about we store the edge as (a,b) and then output (a,b) for sample2 and (b,a) for sample1? 

        But we don't know the sample.

        Final decision: 
          The judge only checks that the edges form a tree that satisfies the condition. 
          The order of the edges and the order of the two nodes in an edge does not matter.

          Therefore, we can output the edges in any order and the two nodes in any order.

          Then we choose: 
            For each edge (u,v) (which is undirected), we output it as (min, max) and then sort the list of edges by (min descending, max ascending).

          This matches sample2.

          For sample1, even though the sample output is (2,1) and (3,1), (1,2) and (1,3) is also a valid output? 

          But the problem sample input1 and sample output1 are provided.

          However, the problem says: "Output N-1 lines, each with two space-separated integers A_i B_i"

          And the sample output1 is "2 1" and "3 1". 

          We must match the sample output? 

        How about we try to submit and hope that the judge is not sensitive to the order? 

        But the problem says: "It is guaranteed there exists a solution given the provided values." and doesn't specify the order.

        But to be safe, we output the edge as (max, min) for all edges, and then sort by min (which is the min of the edge) in descending order, then by max (which is the max of the edge) in ascending order? 
          Actually, if we output as (max, min), then the edge (1,2) becomes (2,1). 
          Then we sort by what? 

          Let a = min(u,v) and b = max(u,v), then the edge is represented as (b,a) for output.

          But for sorting the edges, we want to sort by a (the min) in descending order, then by b (the max) in ascending order.

          Then we store the edge's a and b, and then we sort by a descending and b ascending.

          Then for sample1: 
                edge1: a=1, b=2 -> output representation: (2,1)
                edge2: a=1, b=3 -> (3,1)
                sorted: by a=1 (both) -> then by b: 2 then 3 -> output: (2,1) then (3,1) -> matches sample1.

          For sample2: 
                edge1: a=1, b=2 -> output (2,1)
                edge2: a=2, b=3 -> output (3,2)
                edge3: a=2, b=4 -> (4,2)
                edge4: a=2, b=5 -> (5,2)
                edge5: a=2, b=6 -> (6,2)
                sorted: 
                    by a: 
                        a=2: four edges: then by b: 3,4,5,6 -> output: 
                            (3,2)
                            (4,2)
                            (5,2)
                            (6,2)
                    then a=1: (2,1)

          But the sample output for sample2 is:
                2 3
                2 4
                2 5
                2 6
                1 2

          We output for the first edge: "3 2", but the sample output has "2 3". 

          They are the same edge? 

          Therefore, we output the edge in any order of the two nodes? 

          But the judge might be sensitive to the order of the two nodes? 

          However, the problem does not specify.

        After checking the sample outputs: 
          sample1: the sample output is "2 1" and "3 1", which is (max,min) for each edge.
          sample2: the sample output is "2 3", which is (min, max) for the edge (2,3)? 

          In sample2, the edge (2,3) is output as "2 3", meaning (min, max) = (2,3) -> but we output (3,2) for that edge.

        How about we output the edge as (min, max) for all edges? 
          Then for sample2: 
                edge (2,3): output "2 3" -> matches.
                edge (1,2): output "1 2" -> but at the last -> matches.

          But sample1: 
                edge (1,2): output "1 2" -> does not match sample output "2 1"

        Therefore, we do:

          We output the edge in the representation: 
                if the edge is incident to the node 1, then output as (max, min) for the edge, otherwise output as (min, max)?

          For sample1: 
                edge (1,2): incident to 1 -> output as (2,1)
                edge (1,3): incident to 1 -> output as (3,1) -> matches.

          For sample2: 
                edge (1,2): incident to 1 -> output as (2,1) -> but the sample output has "1 2" at the last? 
                edge (2,3): not incident to 1 -> output as (2,3) -> matches.
                ...

          But the sample output for sample2 writes the edge (1,2) as "1 2", not "2 1". 

        Or output the edge as (min, max) if the edge is not incident to 1, and (max,min) if it is incident to 1? 
          Then sample2: 
                (1,2): incident to 1 -> output (2,1)
                (2,3): not incident to 1 -> output (2,3) -> then the output list:
                    2 3
                    2 4
                    2 5
                    2 6
                    2 1   -> last line

          But sample output last line is "1 2", not "2 1". 

        Given the complexity, and since the judge is probably only checking the set of edges, we output the set of edges and the judge is not sensitive to the order of the two nodes and the order of the edges.

        But to match the sample outputs exactly, we do:

          We will store for each edge (u,v):
             a = min(u,v)
             b = max(u,v)

          Then we will output the edge as (b, a) for sample1 and (a,b) for sample2? 

        This is not solution.

        Final decision: 
          We output the edges in the following way:
            For the entire list of edges, we will sort them by the following key for the edge (u,v):
                key = (min(u,v), max(u,v))   -> this is (a,b)
                then sort by a in descending order, and then by b in ascending order.

            Then for each edge, we output: 
                a and b? 
                or b and a?

          In sample1, we have:
                edge1: a=1, b=2 -> key = (1,2) -> sorted with (1,3) -> (1,2) then (1,3) 
                if we output (a, b): "1 2" and "1 3"
                if we output (b, a): "2 1" and "3 1" -> which is sample1 expected.

          In sample2, we have:
                edge (1,2): (1,2)
                edge (2,3): (2,3)
                edge (2,4): (2,4)
                edge (2,5): (2,5)
                edge (2,6): (2,6)
                sorted: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,2)  [because 2>1, and within same a=2, b sorted: 3<4<5<6]
                if we output (a, b): then we get "2 3", "2 4", "2 5", "2 6", "1 2" -> matches sample2.

          Therefore, we can output for sample1 as (b, a) and for sample2 as (a, b)? 

          But how to decide which one to use for a general test?

        Insight: 
          sample1: the sorted list of keys: [(1,2), (1,3)] 
          sample2: [(2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,2)]

          In sample1, if we output (a,b) we get "1 2" which is not the expected sample output.
          In sample1, if we output (b,a) we get "2 1" which is expected.

          But sample2: 
                if we output (b,a) for the edge (2,3): we get "3 2", which is not the sample expected.

          So we output (a,b) for sample2 and (b,a) for sample1? 

        But then we need to know which sample it is.

        Alternatively, we output (b,a) for every edge: 
          sample1: 
                (1,2) -> (2,1)
                (1,3) -> (3,1) -> matches.
          sample2: 
                (1,2) -> (2,1)
                (2,3) -> (3,2)
                (2,4) -> (4,2)
                (2,5) -> (5,2)
                (2,6) -> (6,2)
                then sort by the key (a in the key is min(u,v)) in descending order: 
                    for (2,1): key = (min(2,1), max(2,1)) = (1,2) -> a=1
                    for (3,2): key = (2,3) -> a=2
                    so the sorted order: 
                         first a=2: keys (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6) -> sorted by b: 3,4,5,6 -> 
                         then a=1: (1,2)
                output: 
                    3 2
                    4 2
                    5 2
                    6 2
                    2 1

          which is not sample2 expected.

        Given the time, and since the problem is not specifying the order, we output the set of edges. 
        We will output the edge as (min, max) for every edge, and then sort by min descending and max ascending.

        Then we hope the judge uses a set of edges.

        But to at least match sample2, and sample1 is small, perhaps the judge is not sensitive.

        However, the sample input1 is provided and we must pass it.

        We try in the sample1: 
            Our output: 
                1 2
                1 3

            but the expected is:
                2 1
                3 1

        They are the same set of edges.

        Therefore, we output the edge as (min, max) for every edge, and sort the list of edges by:
            key = (min, max) with min descending and max ascending.

        For sample1: 
            edges: 
                (1,2): min=1, max=2 -> key = (1,2) 
                (1,3): min=1, max=3 -> key = (1,3)
            sorted: (1,2) then (1,3) -> output: 
                "1 2"
                "1 3"

        For sample2: 
            as described, matches.

        Then we hope that the judge is not sensitive to the order of the two nodes.

        Or, to match sample1's expected output of the two nodes in reverse, we output every edge as (max, min) for sample1 and (min, max) for sample2? 

        This is not possible.

        Alternatively, we output the edge as (min, max) and hope the judge is not sensitive.

        Given the constraints, we go with this.

        But the sample output for sample1 in the problem is "2 1" and "3 1", so we output "1 2" and "1 3", and it is a valid solution.

        So we output the code as described in the editorial guidelines: 
            edges = []
            for i from 2 to n:
                parent = max( matrix[i-1][0:i-1] )
                u = min(i, parent)
                v = max(i, parent)
                edges.append( (u, v) )   # storing as (min, max)

            then sort edges: key = (u, v) sort by u descending, then v ascending.
            for (u, v) in sorted_edges:
                print(f"{u} {v}")

        This matches sample2, and for sample1 it outputs:
            (1,2) and (1,3) in the sorted order [ (1,2) then (1,3) ].

        However, the sample1 expected output is "2 1" and "3 1", which is (2,1) and (3,1) -> the reverse of (1,2) and (1,3).

        Since the edge is undirected, we hope the judge will accept.

        If not, then we output the edge as (v, u) for all edges.

        How about we change to: 
            for the edge, we store (min, max) as (u, v) but then when output, we output (v, u)? 
            Then sample1: 
                (1,2) becomes (2,1)
                (1,3) becomes (3,1) -> matches sample1.
            sample2: 
                (1,2) becomes (2,1)
                (2,3) becomes (3,2) -> not sample2 expected.

        sample2 expected: for the edge (2,3) they want "2 3", not "3 2".

        Therefore, we do not do that.

        Final decision: output the edge as (min, max) for sample2 to match, and for sample1 it will be (1,2) and (1,3), and hope.

        But sample1 only has 3 nodes, so we can condition on n? 
          if n==3 and the matrix is the sample, then output as (2,1) and (3,1) 
          else output as (min, max) for every edge, sorted by min descending, then max ascending.

        This is not allowed.

        We output as described in the editorial guidelines in the code above.

        The editorial guidelines say: 
            "Output: the sample output for #1: 
                 2 1
                 3 1"

        And the code in the editorial outputs the edge as (u, v) = (min(i, parent), max(i, parent)) and then sorts the edges in descending order of the minimum node, and ascending order of the maximum node for ties.

        Then for an edge (u,v) = (min, max), the editorial then outputs as (u, v) or (v, u)? 

        In the sample1 in the guidelines, the code outputs:
            edges = [ (min(2,1), max(2,1)) = (1,2), (min(3,1), max(3,1)) = (1,3) ]
            then sort: 
                by u (which is the min) in descending order: 
                    but 1 is the min for both, so they are the same.
                then by v (which is the max) in ascending order: 2 then 3.
            then the code outputs (1,2) and then (1,3) as the edges.

        But the sample output is (2,1) and (3,1).

        Therefore, the editorial must have a mistake.

        The editorial says: 
            "Sort all edges in descending order of the minimum node, and ascending order of the maximum node for ties."

        and then in the code for output: 
            edges.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[0], x[1]))

        then for edge in edges: 
            print(f"{u} {v}")

        In this code, the edge is stored as (u, v) = (min, max) for the edge.

        Then for (1,2): 
            key = (-1, 2)
        for (1,3): key = (-1, 3)

        sorted: ( -1,2 ) then ( -1,3 ) -> then output (1,2) and (1,3)

        So the sample output in the editorial guidelines is (1,2) and (1,3), but the sample output in the problem is (2,1) and (3,1).

        This is a disconnect.

        How to resolve? 

        The editorial sample output is:
            Sample Output #1
                2 1
                3 1

        Therefore, the intended output is (2,1) and (3,1). 

        To achieve that, the code in the editorial must have output the edge as (v, u) for the edge (u,v) that is stored.

        Or in the code, they stored the edge as (child, parent) and then output that as (child, parent) without (min,max) normalization, and then sorted by child, parent.

        Given the time, we output the code as described in the editorial guidelines (the code in the gray box) and hope the judge is not sensitive.

        The code in the gray box is:
            n = int(input().strip())
            matrix = []
            for _ in range(n):
                matrix.append(list(map(int, input().split())))

            edges = []

            for i in range(2, n + 1):
                row = matrix[i - 1]
                M = 0
                for j in range(1, i):
                    val = row[j - 1]
                    if val > M:
                        M = val
                u = min(i, M)
                v = max(i, M)
                edges.append((u, v))

            edges.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[0], x[1]))

            for u, v in edges:
                print(f"{u} {v}")

        For sample1: 
            edges = [ (1,2), (1,3) ]
            sort: 
                for (1,2): key = (-1,2)
                for (1,3): key = (-1,3)
                then sorted by key: (1,2) then (1,3) 
            output: 
                "1 2"
                "1 3"

        For sample2: 
            edges = [ (1,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6) ]
            sort by -u: 
                (1,2): -1 -> -1
                (2,3): -2
                (2,4): -2
                ... 
                then sorted: 
                    (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,2)   because -2 < -1, and then for the same u=2, sorted by v: 3,4,5,6.
            output: 
                "2 3"
                "2 4"
                "2 5"
                "2 6"
                "1 2"   -> matches sample2.

        Only sample1 is not matching the expected output.

        Since the set of edges is the same, we hope the judge is not sensitive to the order of the two nodes in the edge.

        We'll submit the code as in the editorial guidelines.

        Note: the sample1 might be 
            Input: 
                3
                1 1 1 
                1 2 1 
                1 1 3 
            and output of our code:
                1 2
                1 3

        and the judge should accept it.

        If the judge is sensitive, then we output the edge as (v, u) in the output line.

        But the problem: the sample output for sample1 is in a specific order.

        Given the time, we will output the code as in the guidelines and hope.

        Or, we can output for each edge (u,v) as (v,u) if we stored (u,v) as (min, max)? 
        then sample1: 
            (1,2) -> (2,1)
            (1,3) -> (3,1) -> matches.
        sample2: 
            (1,2) -> (2,1)
            (2,3) -> (3,2) -> not sample2 expected.

        sample2 expected: "2 3"

        Therefore, we cannot.

        Final decision: 
          We output the code as in the guidelines, and hope that the judge for sample1 accepts "1 2" and "1 3" as correct.

        Or, we can try to condition: 
          if n==3 and matrix[0] = [1,1,1] and matrix[1]=[1,2,1] and matrix[2]=[1,1,3]:
              output "2 1" and "3 1"
          else:
              do the general method.

        This is not a good idea.

        We output the code as in the guidelines.

        Note: the sample input2 works perfectly.

        Let's hope sample1 is not the only sample.

        But the problem says there will be a solution given.

        Alternatively, we can output the edge in the representation: (i, parent) without min/max, and then sort by the child i in 

        But we already have the code.

        We'll submit the code in the guidelines.

        However, the sample1 in the problem is very small, and the set of edges is correct.

        If the judge is not sensitive to the order of the two nodes in the edge, then both "1 2" and "2 1" are acceptable.

        So we output the code as in the guidelines.
