 We are counting the number of edges in the first tree that are not in the second tree.
 Steps:
 1. Read N.
 2. Read the next N-1 edges for the first tree, normalize each edge (so that we store (min, max)).
 3. Read the next N-1 edges for the second tree, normalize and store in a set.
 4. For each edge in the first tree, if the normalized edge is not in the set of the second tree, then we count it.
 5. The count is the answer.

 Why is this correct?
 Because each edge in the first tree that is not in the second tree must be removed and replaced by an edge from the second tree that is missing in the first tree. 
 Note: The operation removes one edge and adds one edge. The edges that are common do not require an operation. 
 However, note that the problem does not require us to specify which edges to add, only the count. 

 But note: We must be cautious. The problem does not require that we replace an edge by one specific edge? 
 However, the key insight is that the set of edges that are in the second tree but not in the first must be exactly the same size as the set we are counting? 
 Actually, the number of edges in the first tree that are not in the second is the same as the number of edges in the second tree that are not in the first? 
 Why? Because both trees have the same number of edges (n-1). Therefore:
   |E1 ∩ E2| = common edges.
   Then |E1 \ E2| = (n-1) - |E1 ∩ E2|
   Similarly, |E2 \ E1| = (n-1) - |E1 ∩ E2| = |E1 \ E2|

 So the count we are doing (edges in E1 not in E2) is the same as the number of edges in E2 not in E1. 

 However, note: each operation removes one edge from E1 and adds one edge from E2. Therefore, we need one operation for each edge that we must remove (which is each edge in E1 not in E2). And we have exactly the same number of edges to add (from E2 not in E1). 

 Therefore, the answer is the count.

 Example: 
   Sample Input #1:
        4
        1 2
        2 3
        3 4   --> first tree edges: (1,2), (2,3), (3,4)
        3 1
        4 1
        2 4   --> second tree edges: (1,3), (1,4), (2,4)

   Normalized edges for first tree: 
        (1,2), (2,3), (3,4)
   Normalized edges for second tree: 
        (1,3), (1,4), (2,4) -> stored in set.

   Now check:
        (1,2) -> not in set -> count=1
        (2,3) -> not in set -> count=2
        (3,4) -> not in set -> count=3

   Output: 3.

 However, the sample output is 3. So it matches.

 Therefore, the code is as below.

 Important: The constraints are up to 10^5, so using a set is efficient.

 Let's code accordingly.
