To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of operations required to transform one tree into another tree with the same set of vertices. Each operation involves removing an edge from the current tree and adding a new edge such that the resulting structure remains a tree (connected and acyclic).

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves comparing two trees, \( T1 \) (the original tree) and \( T2 \) (the target tree), both with \( N \) vertices. The goal is to find the minimum number of edge replacement operations needed to convert \( T1 \) into \( T2 \). Each operation consists of removing an edge from \( T1 \) and adding an edge from \( T2 \) that is not present in \( T1 \), ensuring the graph remains a tree after each operation.

2. **Key Insight**: The edges common to both trees do not require any operations. The number of operations needed is equal to the number of edges in \( T1 \) that are not present in \( T2 \). This is because each operation replaces one such edge from \( T1 \) with a missing edge from \( T2 \).

3. **Algorithm Selection**: 
   - **Normalize Edges**: Represent each edge as a tuple of (min(u, v), max(u, v)) to handle undirected edges uniformly.
   - **Efficient Lookup**: Store the edges of \( T2 \) in a hash set for O(1) average-time membership checks.
   - **Count Mismatched Edges**: Iterate through each edge in \( T1 \), count how many are not found in \( T2 \).

4. **Complexity Analysis**: 
   - **Time Complexity**: O(N) for reading and processing the edges. The set operations (insertion and lookup) are O(1) on average.
   - **Space Complexity**: O(N) to store the edges of \( T2 \) in a hash set and the edges of \( T1 \) in a list.

### Solution Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    
    int N;
    cin >> N;
    
    vector<pair<int, int>> tree1;
    tree1.reserve(N - 1);
    for (int i = 0; i < N - 1; i++) {
        int u, v;
        cin >> u >> v;
        if (u > v) swap(u, v);
        tree1.push_back({u, v});
    }
    
    unordered_set<long long> tree2Set;
    tree2Set.reserve(N - 1);
    for (int i = 0; i < N - 1; i++) {
        int u, v;
        cin >> u >> v;
        if (u > v) swap(u, v);
        long long key = 1LL * u * (N + 1) + v;
        tree2Set.insert(key);
    }
    
    int count = 0;
    for (auto edge : tree1) {
        long long key = 1LL * edge.first * (N + 1) + edge.second;
        if (tree2Set.find(key) == tree2Set.end()) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    
    cout << count << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency. The first value is \( N \), the number of vertices.
2. **Processing First Tree (\( T1 \))**: The next \( N-1 \) lines (edges of \( T1 \)) are read. Each edge is normalized (smaller vertex first) and stored in a list.
3. **Processing Second Tree (\( T2 \))**: The subsequent \( N-1 \) lines (edges of \( T2 \)) are read, normalized, and stored in a hash set for O(1) average-time lookups. Each edge is converted into a unique key using the formula \( u \times (N + 1) + v \).
4. **Counting Operations**: For each edge in \( T1 \), we check if it exists in \( T2 \) using the hash set. If it does not, we increment our count.
5. **Output Result**: The count, representing the number of edges in \( T1 \) not present in \( T2 \), is printed. This count is the minimum number of operations needed to transform \( T1 \) into \( T2 \), as each operation replaces one such edge with a missing edge from \( T2 \).
