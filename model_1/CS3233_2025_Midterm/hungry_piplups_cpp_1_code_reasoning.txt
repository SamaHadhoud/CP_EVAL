 We note the constraints: M <= 5000, and each query can iterate over up to 1000 + (R-L+1) which is at most 1000+1000=2000? Actually, the starting values are at most 500, and the number of days in a query can be up to 10^6? But wait, the problem says M<=5000, but the query range [L,R] can be up to 10^6? However, note the key: the A_i are bounded (0<=A_i<=N-1, but also note that in the constraints it says A_i, X_i <= 500). However, the sample input has A_i up to 5, but the problem says A_i in [0, N-1] and N up to 10^6, but then the constraints also say A_i <= 500? Actually, the constraints say: "1 <= X_i, A_i <= 500" (but note: the input says A_i from 0 to N-1, and also in the constraints: A_i>=1? Actually the input says 0<=A_i<=N-1, but then the constraints say 1<=A_i<=500? This might be a discrepancy. However, the sample input has A_i=1,3,2,4,5 which are all in [1,5]. And the constraints say 1<=A_i<=500. So we can rely on A_i being at most 500.

 But note: the update can set A_i to X_i, which is between 1 and 500? Actually, the constraints for update: "0 Pi Xi" and the constraint for Xi: the constraints say "1<=Xi, Ai<=500", so Xi is also in [1,500].

 Therefore, for any day, the starting iceberg is between 1 and 500.

 How does the process work?
 For a query [L, R], we have a set of starting positions: A[L-1] to A[R-1]. Each piplup starts at a value and then moves to the next available iceberg. We are to find the X_i-th smallest unoccupied iceberg after processing all these.

 However, note: the problem says: "find the position of the X_i-th piplup" actually means: the group of X_i piplups will start at iceberg 1 and then each moves to the next available. But note the query is: "determine the furthest iceburg that any of them will end up at" and then we are told that the answer for the sample query "1 2 4 2" is 5.

 But note: the problem says: "the students ... they wish to determine the furthest iceburg (i.e., the largest numbered iceburg) that any of them will end up at". Actually, the problem then asks: "output a single integer representing the position of the X_i^{th} piplup only considering piplups from day L_i to R_i inclusive." 

 This is a bit confusing. Let me re-read:

 "As a group of X_i Piplups, they will start leaving one by one, all heading for iceburg 1. ... they wish to determine the furthest iceburg (i.e., the largest numbered iceburg) that any of them will end up at"

 But then the sample input: 
   First query: days 2 to 4: A[1]=3, A[2]=2, A[3]=4. The existing piplups from the professor's records on days 2 to 4 are at:
        Day2: starts at 3 -> goes to 3 (if empty) -> then day3: starts at 2 -> goes to 2 -> then day4: starts at 4 -> goes to 4? 
        So occupied: 2,3,4.
   Then the students, as a group of 2, start at iceberg 1. 
        First student: goes to 1? But 1 is not occupied? Then why the answer is 5?

 Actually, the problem says: "with the information they have" meaning they have the records from days L to R. So the icebergs occupied by the piplups from the professor's records in [L,R] are already taken.

 The students are additional? But note: the problem says: "they assume that no Piplups left on days outside this range". So the only occupied icebergs are the ones from the records in [L,R]. 

 Now the students are a group of X_i piplups, and they start leaving one by one, all heading for iceberg 1. The first one will take the smallest iceberg that is not in the set of occupied ones? But note: the existing occupied set is {2,3,4}. Then the smallest unoccupied is 1? Then why the first student takes 1? Then the second would take the next, which is 5? And then the furthest is 5? 

 But the problem says: "the position of the X_i-th piplup", meaning the second one ends at 5? And that is the answer.

 So the problem is: given the set S of occupied icebergs from the records in [L,R], then we have a group of X_i piplups that start at 1 and each takes the next available iceberg (so they take the first X_i unoccupied icebergs starting from 1). Then we are to output the iceberg that the last one (the X_i-th) takes? But note: the problem says "the furthest iceburg that any of them will end up at" which is the last one (the X_i-th) since the unoccupied icebergs are in increasing order.

 However, note: the problem says "the X_i-th piplup", so we are to output the iceberg of the X_i-th one.

 Therefore, we need to compute the X_i-th smallest unoccupied iceberg in the set that is the complement of the set of icebergs occupied by the professor's records in [L,R].

 But note: the professor's records form a set of icebergs that are occupied. How do we compute the set? 

 However, the process described in the problem for the professor's records is that each day a piplup starts at A_i and then moves to the next available. So the set of occupied icebergs is the result of:

   S = {}
   for i from L to R:
        x = A_i
        while x is in S: x++
        then add x to S.

 But note: the starting values are small (1..500) and the total number of days in the query is len = (R-L+1) which can be large (up to 10^6). However, the maximum iceberg we might reach is at most the maximum starting value + len? Actually, worst-case: if we have all piplups starting at 1, then we get 1,2,3,...,len. So the icebergs occupied are the consecutive integers from min_value to min_value+len-1? Not exactly: they might start at different values.

 But note: the starting values are at most 500. Therefore, the maximum iceberg we might assign for one day is at most 500 + len? Because worst-case we start at 500 and then we have to skip len-1 icebergs? Actually, worst-case: we start at 1 and then all the numbers 1 to len are taken? Then the next one would be len+1? Actually, the maximum iceberg assigned in the professor's records for a query of len days is at most 500 + len? 

 However, the problem says: the students are going to take the first X_i unoccupied icebergs starting from 1. The unoccupied icebergs are the gaps below the minimum occupied, and then above the occupied set.

 But note: the students start at 1, so they take the smallest X_i unoccupied icebergs. The X_i-th one is the answer.

 How to compute the X_i-th unoccupied iceberg without simulating up to a very high number?

 We note: 
   Let U = max_iceberg_occupied (from the professor) + X_i? But worst-case the unoccupied icebergs below the max_iceberg_occupied might be many? Actually, we can simulate the professor's records and then know the set of occupied icebergs in a bounded range? 

 We can set an upper bound: we know that the professor's records will assign at most len icebergs. And the starting values are at most 500. Therefore, the maximum iceberg assigned in the professor's records is at most 500 + len? Actually, worst-case: we have len days and the starting values are 1, then we assign 1,2,...,len -> so maximum is len. If starting value is 500, and then we have 500,501,...,500+len-1 -> maximum is 500+len-1.

 So we can set an upper bound: U_bound = max( max_possible_occupied, X_i + 500 + len )? Actually, we don't need to go that high. We only care about the first X_i unoccupied icebergs. The first X_i unoccupied might be in the range [1, U] where U = 500 + len + X_i? Because the professor's records occupy at most len icebergs in the range [1, 500+len-1]. Then the unoccupied icebergs in [1, 500+len-1] are (500+len-1) - len = 500-1? That's not enough. Actually, the unoccupied icebergs in [1, U] is U - (number of occupied in [1, U]).

 We want the X_i-th unoccupied. If we set U = 500 + len + X_i, then the number of unoccupied in [1, U] is U - (number of occupied in [1, U]) >= (500+len+X_i) - len = 500+X_i >= X_i (if 500>=0, which it is). So we are safe: the X_i-th unoccupied is at most 500+len+X_i.

 However, note: the occupied set might not cover the entire range [1, 500+len-1]? So we might have more unoccupied below 500+len? But we are including up to 500+len+X_i, which is enough.

 But the constraints: len can be up to 10^6, and X_i up to 500, so 500+10^6+500 = 1001000, which is acceptable? We have to simulate the professor's records for the query and mark the occupied icebergs in the range [1, U_bound] and then count the unoccupied? Then we can traverse to find the X_i-th unoccupied? But traversing 1001000 for each query (which can be 5000) would be 5000 * 1001000 = 5e9, which is too slow.

 We need a more efficient method.

 Insight: we can use a DSU (union-find) to simulate the next available iceberg. We can simulate each of the professor's records in the query range and mark the occupied icebergs and update the DSU. Then we can use the DSU to quickly find the next available iceberg? Actually, we are going to simulate the professor's records and then we want to know the set of occupied. Then we want to know the X_i-th unoccupied? 

 Alternatively: we can simulate the professor's records and then we have a boolean array for [1, U_bound]? But then we can use a Fenwick tree? However, we have 5000 queries and U_bound=1001000, and 5000*1001000 is 5e9 booleans? That's 5e9 bytes = 5 GB, which is too much.

 Instead, we can use a DSU that is reset only for the necessary positions? We note that each query we only care about the range [1, U_bound] with U_bound = len + 500 + X_i? Actually, we can set U_bound = len + 1000? Because len = R-L+1, and the starting values are at most 500, and we are only going to assign at most len numbers, but the maximum we might assign is at most 500+len. Then we set U_bound = len + 1000 (which is at least 500+len+500? no, 1000 might be too small? Actually, worst-case: if we start at 500, and then we have to skip 500 consecutive taken, then we land at 500, then 501, ... up to 500+len-1. Then the maximum occupied is 500+len-1. Then we need to consider unoccupied up to at least 500+len-1 + X_i? But note: the unoccupied icebergs below 500+len might be 499 (if we started at 500 and skipped nothing) and then the rest beyond 500+len-1. So the X_i-th unoccupied might be at 500+len-1 + (X_i - (number of unoccupied below 500+len)).

 However, we can do:

   Step 1: Simulate the professor's records for the days [L,R] and record the set of occupied icebergs in the range [1, U_bound] where U_bound = len + 1000? (because X_i<=500, and we have at most 500 unoccupied in the lower part? Actually, the starting values are at least 1, so the occupied set does not cover the entire [1,500] necessarily? So the unoccupied below 500+len might be (500+len) - len = 500? Actually, the occupied set has exactly len elements. The entire range [1,500+len] has 500+len integers, so the unoccupied in [1,500+len] is 500. Then if X_i<=500, then the answer is the X_i-th unoccupied in [1,500+len]. But if X_i>500, then the answer is 500+len + (X_i-500).

 Therefore, we can set U_bound = len + 1000 (which is len+1000, which is at least len+500+? but 1000 is safe for X_i<=500 because we only need up to the (len+500+500) = len+1000?).

 Actually, we can set U_bound = len + 1000.

 Then we do:

   Initialize an array for the DSU for the range [1, U_bound] but we don't want to initialize the entire array for each query (because U_bound can be 10^6+1000 and we have 5000 queries -> 5000*10^6 is 5e9, too slow).

 Instead, we can use a lazy DSU: we maintain a global array for next_ptr and a timestamp array. We use a global variable `now` that increments for each query. For a position i, if timestamp[i] != now, we reset it.

   How the DSU works: 
      next_ptr[x] points to the next available iceberg >= x. Initially, next_ptr[x] = x (if unvisited in this query). When we occupy x, we set next_ptr[x] = next_ptr[x+1] (by unioning with x+1).

   However, we can do:

      function find(x): 
          if x > U_bound: return x (because beyond our bound, we don't store, and we know it's available so we return x)
          if timestamp[x] != now: then we reset next_ptr[x] = x, and timestamp[x] = now.
          if next_ptr[x] != x: then we set next_ptr[x] = find(next_ptr[x])
          return next_ptr[x]

   Then to mark an iceberg x as taken:
        y = find(x)   // this is the iceberg we assign for this record
        if y <= U_bound:
            then we mark next_ptr[y] = find(y+1)

   Then, after processing all the professor's records, we want to find the X_i-th unoccupied. How?

      We note: the unoccupied icebergs are the ones for which find(x) == x? Not exactly: the DSU has next_ptr[x] pointing to the next available. Actually, the DSU is set up so that for an unoccupied iceberg, find(x) = x? And for an occupied one, find(x) points to a higher available.

      But we don't have an explicit list of unoccupied. How to get the X_i-th unoccupied?

        We can traverse starting from 1? But that would be O(U_bound) per query -> 1001000 per query, 5000 queries -> 5e9.

      Alternatively, we can note that the DSU structure already allows us to jump: 
          Let current = 0.
          For i from 1 to X_i:
              current = find(current+1)

          Then current is the X_i-th unoccupied.

      Why? 
          We start at 0. Then the next available after 0 is find(1). Then we set current = find(1). Then for the next, we do find(current+1). This skips all the occupied and gives the next unoccupied. We do this X_i times.

      But note: the professor's records have already updated the DSU? Yes, so when we do find(1) we get the first unoccupied iceberg.

      However, what if the first unoccupied is 1? Then we get 1. Then we do find(2) for the next? But what if 2 is occupied? Then we get the next available after 2.

      This will work.

      But worst-case, we do X_i jumps, and X_i<=500, so 500 per query -> 5000*500 = 2.5e6, which is acceptable.

   However, we also have to simulate the professor's records: for each day, we do a chain of finds? But note: worst-case chain for one record: if we start at 1 and 1,2,...,k-1 are taken, then we have to do k finds? The k might be up to the length of consecutive taken? But we have at most len records and the total cost might be O(len * len) worst-case? 

   But the DSU with path compression will make each find nearly O(1) amortized? However, we are resetting the DSU for each query. But note: we are using a lazy array that only initializes the nodes we visit. The total number of distinct nodes visited in one query is at most the number of occupied icebergs plus the number of jumps we do for the professor's records? Actually, for one record, we start at x and then we do:

        y0 = find(x)
        then we mark y0 as taken: so we set next_ptr[y0] = find(y0+1)

        How many nodes do we visit? The path from x to y0 and then from y0+1 to the next available? But note, the path compression will collapse the entire chain. The total distinct nodes we touch in the DSU for the entire query is bounded by O(len + number of jumps) but the jumps are at most the gaps? Actually, worst-case we have to skip many icebergs? But our U_bound is len+1000, so we won't go beyond that? Actually, if we start at x and we have to skip until we hit an unoccupied, and the unoccupied we assign is at most len+1000, then each record does at most 1000 jumps? Actually, worst-case: we start at 1 and then we have to skip 1000 occupied? Then we do 1000 jumps? Then the entire query: len * 1000 -> worst-case len=10^6, then 10^6 * 1000 = 1e9, which is too slow.

   We need to avoid the worst-case per record.

   Actually, the DSU find operation is O(1) amortized because of path compression? But note: we are doing a union (merging y0 to the set of y0+1) only one node per record. The entire simulation for the professor's records in one query might be O(len * α(U_bound))? which is acceptable? But worst-case without union-find we might do a linear scan? How does the DSU help?

   The DSU is set up as a "next available" pointer. When we assign an iceberg y0, we set next_ptr[y0] = find(y0+1). Then next time we start at a value <= y0, we jump to find(y0) = find(y0+1). So we skip y0 in one step.

   Therefore, the entire simulation for the professor's records: each record we do at most one find that actually traverses multiple nodes? But the total number of distinct nodes visited in the entire query is O(U_bound) because each node is visited at most once? 

   Why? When we traverse a node in the find, we set its next_ptr to the root of the chain. Then we never traverse the same node twice? Actually, we do: we start at x, then we jump to the next available. Then we mark that node as taken and then we set its next_ptr to the next available beyond it. The entire set of nodes we visit in the DSU for the entire query is the set of occupied icebergs and the ones we skip? But the skipping: if we skip a node that hasn't been visited in this query, then we set its next_ptr to the next available beyond it. Then if we come again to that node, we jump immediately.

   Therefore, each distinct node is visited at most once per query. The total distinct nodes visited per query is at most the number of distinct icebergs we assign and the ones we skip? But note: we skip only until we hit an unvisited node? Actually, we only skip until we hit a node that is already set to a next available beyond? 

   The total distinct nodes visited in the DSU for the entire query is O(U_bound) per query? But we set U_bound = len+1000, which can be 10^6+1000, so about 10^6 per query? Then 5000 queries would be 5000 * 10^6 = 5e9, which is too slow.

   We need a better bound.

   Actually, we note that we are only processing the professor's records: len = (R-L+1) days. Each day we do a find that visits a set of nodes that are contiguous and that have not been visited? Actually, the first time we visit a contiguous block of taken nodes, we set their next_ptr to the next available beyond. Then the next time we start in that block we jump immediately.

   The total distinct nodes visited is the number of icebergs we assign (len) plus the gaps we skip? The gaps: we skip only when we hit an unvisited node? Actually, we skip until we hit a node that is not taken? But we are assigning one node per day, and we skip over the taken nodes. The total number of gaps we skip is exactly the number of taken nodes we skip? But each taken node we skip is one we already assigned? So we don't need to skip them again? Because we set the next_ptr to jump over them.

   Therefore, the total distinct nodes visited in the entire query is O(len + number_of_initial_gaps_we_skip)? Actually, the gaps we skip are at most the length of the contiguous segments we break? But note: we are only going to skip over a node at most once per query? Because once we skip a node, we set its next_ptr to the next available beyond, so we never skip it again.

   Therefore, the total distinct nodes visited in the entire query is O(U_bound) per query? But wait, we set U_bound = len+1000, so we are only going to visit nodes in [1, len+1000]? And the total distinct nodes in that range is len+1000. But we are only visiting the nodes that are either assigned or skipped? The skipped nodes: we skip a node only if it is taken? And we assign exactly len nodes. The skipped nodes: we might skip over a node that is not taken? No: we skip because we think it might be taken? But in the DSU, we set next_ptr to jump over taken nodes. So we never actually visit a taken node again? 

   Actually, the DSU find operation for a starting point x: 
        if the node x is unvisited (timestamp != now) then we set next_ptr[x]=x and then we don't skip? But then we assign it? Then we set next_ptr[x] = find(x+1). Then we visit x+1. Similarly, if x is visited and next_ptr[x] is set, we jump to that.

   How many nodes do we visit per record? Only the ones that are unvisited? And then we mark them as visited? Then the total distinct nodes visited per query is O(len+number_of_gaps) but the gaps we skip are at most the number of consecutive taken? Actually, the entire range [1, U_bound] is visited at most once? 

   Therefore, the total cost per query is O(U_bound) in the worst-case? And U_bound = len+1000, which can be 10^6+1000, so about 10^6 per query. Then 5000 queries would be 5e9, which is too slow.

   We must optimize.

   Alternative idea: we note that the starting values are small (<=500). Therefore, the maximum iceberg assigned for the professor's records is at most 500+len. We set U_bound = min(500+len, len+1000) -> actually len+1000 is at least 500+len (if len>=500) so it's the same.

   But we cannot avoid O(len+1000) per query? And worst-case len=10^6, then 10^6 per query, 5000 queries -> 5e9, which is 5 seconds in C++? But the problem says time limit 2.0 seconds? And 5e9 operations might be borderline on a fast machine? But worst-case we are doing 5e9 operations? And each operation is a few instructions? We can hope that the path compression reduces the constant? But worst-case without path compression we do linear per record? With path compression, we do O(α) per record? But the total distinct nodes visited is O(len+1000) per query? Actually, the entire DSU simulation for the professor's records: we are going to visit each node at most once? So the total number of nodes visited across all records in one query is U_bound? Because we set next_ptr for each node we visit? Then we do one find per record? And then the union? 

   Actually, the total number of DSU operations (find) for the professor's records in one query is len (one per record) and then the union (which is one per record) and then the gaps? But the gaps: we are skipping over contiguous taken? The DSU path compression will collapse the entire contiguous taken segment? So each contiguous segment is visited once? Then the total nodes visited is the number of contiguous segments? But worst-case the occupied set is contiguous? Then we only visit the start and the end? 

   Actually, the DSU find for a record: 
        We start at x, then we do:
            if x is unvisited: then we assign it -> then we mark it and then we set next_ptr[x] = find(x+1). So we then do a find at x+1? Then if x+1 is unvisited, we assign it? No, we are not assigning it for this record? We are just setting next_ptr[x] to the next available beyond x? Actually, we do:

        For a record with starting value x:
            y = find(x)   // which returns x if it is unvisited? But if it is unvisited, we set next_ptr[x]=x, so we get x. Then we set next_ptr[x] = find(x+1). Then we do a find at x+1? 

        Then the next record that starts at x: we do find(x) -> which now returns find(x+1). So we skip x without visiting it? 

        How many nodes do we visit for one record? 
            If we start at x and x is unvisited, then we visit x and then we do a find at x+1? Then if x+1 is unvisited, we set next_ptr[x+1]=x+1 and then we set next_ptr[x]=x+1? Then we return x as the assignment? Then we mark x as taken? 

        But then we have to update next_ptr[x] to the next available beyond x? So we do next_ptr[x] = find(x+1) -> which we already computed? Actually, we computed find(x+1) and it returned x+1 (if unvisited) so we set next_ptr[x]=x+1.

        Then the next record that starts at x: 
            find(x) -> we see next_ptr[x]=x+1, then we do find(x+1) -> which returns x+1 (if unvisited) so we assign x+1? Then we set next_ptr[x+1] = find(x+2).

        So for each record, we visit two nodes: the starting node and the next one? 

        But if the starting node is already visited (i.e., taken) then we do:
            find(x) -> returns next_ptr[x] = find(next_ptr[x]) -> which might be a chain? But with path compression, the entire chain is compressed? 

        Actually, the total cost per record is O(1) amortized? 

        Why? Because we are using path compression. When we do find(x) for a node that is taken, we jump to the next available? And then we compress the path? 

        Therefore, the total cost for the professor's records in one query is O(len * α(U_bound))? which is acceptable? 

        But note: we also do the union: when we assign an iceberg y, we set next_ptr[y] = find(y+1). This is one additional find per record? Then total operations: 2 * len? Then the total cost is O(len * α(U_bound))? 

        Then the entire query: 
            Professor's records: O(len * α(U_bound)) 
            Then the students: we do X_i (<=500) finds: each O(α(U_bound))? 

        So total per query: O(len * α(U_bound) + 500) 

        Then 5000 queries: worst-case len=10^6, then 5000 * 10^6 * α(10^6) = 5000 * 10^6 * 5 = 25e9, which is too slow.

   We must optimize the simulation of the professor's records.

   Alternative approach: we note that the starting values are at most 500. We can precompute the next available for the entire range? But we have updates.

   Another idea: we can use a Fenwick tree or segment tree for the entire array? But we have 5000 queries and 10^6 days? And we need to simulate the process for a contiguous segment of days? 

   However, note: the constraints say M<=5000, but the update and query are mixed. And the queries are over contiguous segments? 

   But the starting values are small (<=500). So we can use offline queries? 

   Actually, we can try to use a Mo's algorithm? But 5000 queries and 10^6 days -> the block size would be about 1000, then the total moves would be O(10^6 * sqrt(10^6)) = 10^6 * 1000 = 1e9, which is acceptable? But we have 5000 queries -> 5000*1000 = 5e6 moves? But Mo's algorithm is O(n * sqrt(q))? Actually, total moves = O(n * sqrt(q))? n=10^6, sqrt(5000)=~70, so 10^6*70 = 70e6, which is acceptable? 

   But then we need to support updates? Mo's with updates? That would be 3d Mo? Complexity O(n^(5/3))? Then 10^6^(5/3) is about 10^10? 

   We need a simpler method.

   Given the low constraints on A_i and X_i, and that M is only 5000, we can do:

        For each query, we simulate the professor's records by processing each day in the range [L,R] and using a DSU that covers a bounded range [1, U_bound] with U_bound = len + 1000.

        But worst-case total len over all queries: the worst-case is that each query covers the entire array? Then len = N = 10^6, and 5000 queries would be 5000 * 10^6 = 5e9, which is too slow.

   Therefore, we need to optimize the simulation per query.

   How about we precompute the entire array once and then for a query we subtract the effect of days outside [L,R]? But the process is sequential: the assignment for day i depends on the previous days.

   We can try to use a segment tree that stores the set of occupied icebergs for a segment? But merging two segments: the right segment's assignments depend on the left segment's assignments? 

   Alternative idea: we note that the starting values are small (<=500). Therefore, the entire set of occupied icebergs for a segment [L,R] is contained in the range [min_start, max_start + length]? And we can simulate the segment quickly if we have the set of occupied icebergs? But the set of occupied icebergs can be stored as a bitset? The length is at most 10^6, so the range is 10^6+1000? The bitset would be 10^6+1000 bits -> about 125 KB per segment? But building a segment tree of 10^6 leaves would use 2*10^6 nodes, total memory 2*10^6 * 125 KB = 250e6 KB = 250 GB, too much.

   We need a different idea.

   Given that M is only 5000, we can try to hope that the worst-case total len over all queries is not 5000*10^6? Because the problem says M<=5000, but each query can have len up to 10^6? Then worst-case total len is 5000 * 10^6 = 5e9, which is acceptable in C++ if we do a tight simulation? But our simulation per record in the query is O(1) amortized per record? How can we achieve that?

   We use the DSU with lazy reset and path compression. The total number of distinct nodes touched over all queries might be the sum over queries of (len_i + 1000) = 5000*(10^6+1000) = 5e9, which is too many nodes to touch.

   But note: we are using a global next_ptr and timestamp, and we only reset the nodes that are touched in the query? And the total number of distinct nodes touched over all queries might be the entire range [1, 10^6+1000] for each query? And there are 5000 queries, so we would be touching 5000 * (10^6+1000) = 5e9 nodes, which is 5e9 memory accesses, which might be borderline in C++ on a fast machine (several seconds).

   But the problem says memory limit 512 MB, and our arrays next_ptr and timestamp are of size MAX_U = 1001000, which is about 1001000 * 4 * 2 = 8e6 bytes = 8 MB? So we can have a global array of size 1001000 for next_ptr and timestamp.

   However, the total work in the DSU finds: the amortized cost per find is O(α(1001000)) which is about O(1). Therefore, the total work for the professor's records in one query is O(len_i * α) = O(len_i). And the total work for the students part is O(X_i) = O(500) per query.

   Then the total work over all queries is the sum of len_i for all queries plus 500 * (number of queries). 

   In the worst-case, each query has len_i = 10^6, and there are 5000 queries, then total work = 5000 * 10^6 = 5e9, which is about 5 seconds in C++. But the problem says time limit 2.0 seconds? 

   We must hope that the average len_i is small? Or we must optimize.

   But the problem says that the starting values are small. Can we use this to our advantage?

   We can try to simulate only the distinct starting values? But no, because the same starting value might appear many times and they are processed in order.

   Alternative optimization: 

        We note that the only starting values are in [1,500]. We can maintain an array `next_available` for the starting values? 

        Idea: 
          Let f(x) be the next available iceberg >= x.
          We maintain an array f[1..500] for the next available for each starting value? But the days are sequential and we are only simulating a contiguous segment? 

        However, the effect of the previous days in the query is not known.

   Given the time constraints, we will implement the bounded DSU simulation and hope that the worst-case does not occur or that the constant factors are low.

   Steps:

        Predefine MAX_U = 1001000 (which is 10^6 + 1000? Actually, the maximum len in a query is at most N=10^6, so U_bound = len + 1000 <= 10^6+1000 = 1001000).

        Global arrays: next_ptr[0..MAX_U+1], timestamp[0..MAX_U+1], and now=0.

        For each query:
            if type 0: update the array A at position P-1 to X.
            if type 1: 
                L, R, X_i = input
                len = R-L+1
                U_bound = len + 1000   // we consider icebergs in [1, U_bound]

                now++   // for lazy reset

                // Process professor's records: for j from L-1 to R-1
                for each index j in [L-1, R-1]:
                    x = A[j]
                    // We want to find the next available iceberg >= x
                    int y = find(x, U_bound);   // we pass U_bound to avoid going beyond if we don't care?
                    // But our find function: if x>U_bound, we return x. But x<=500, so it's safe.

                    if (y <= U_bound) {
                        // then we mark y as occupied: set next_ptr[y] = find(y+1, U_bound)
                        next_ptr[y] = find(y+1, U_bound);
                        // Also, we have to update the DSU: we did path compression in find, so we do nothing else?
                    }
                    // if y > U_bound, we don't mark? Because beyond our bound, we don't care.

                // Now, simulate the students: we want the X_i-th unoccupied iceberg.
                // Start from 0, and then do X_i steps.
                int current = 0;
                for (int i = 0; i < X_i; i++) {
                    current = find(current+1, U_bound);
                }
                // But what if during the students simulation we go beyond U_bound? 
                // For example, if there are less than X_i unoccupied icebergs in [1, U_bound]? 
                // We know: unoccupied in [1, U_bound] is U_bound - (number of occupied in [1, U_bound]).
                // But we only processed the professor's records: we occupied exactly the number of records that landed in [1, U_bound]. Some might have gone beyond? 

                // Actually, our simulation for the professor's records: we only assigned an iceberg if it was <= U_bound. If the next available was beyond U_bound, we did not mark any node beyond U_bound? And we did not update the DSU beyond U_bound? 

                // How does find work beyond U_bound? 
                //   In find(x, U_bound): if x>U_bound, we return x. And we don't update next_ptr for x (because we don't set timestamp for x>U_bound).
                //   So if we call find(current+1) and current+1>U_bound, we get current+1.

                // Therefore, if during the students simulation, we are at current and then we do current+1>U_bound, then the next available is current+1.

                // But note: the professor's records might have occupied some icebergs beyond U_bound? 
                //   We did not simulate beyond U_bound for the professor's records: we only assigned an iceberg if it was <=U_bound. If the next available was beyond U_bound, then we did not assign it? Actually, we did: we called find(x) and it might return a value > U_bound? Then we skipped marking because we did the 'if (y<=U_bound)'. So we didn't mark any node beyond U_bound.

                // Therefore, beyond U_bound, every iceberg is unoccupied.

                // So the simulation for the students: 
                //   We start at 0, then we do:
                //        step1: find(1) -> if 1 is not occupied, we get 1. Then we mark it? But wait, we are not updating the DSU for the students? 
                //   Actually, we are not simulating the students' occupation! We are only using the DSU to find the unoccupied icebergs. And the DSU currently has the state of the professor's records. We are not updating the DSU with the students' occupations? 

                //   But the problem: the students are additional, but the query is: "with the information they have" (only the professor's records) and then they take the first X_i unoccupied. We are not updating the professor's records with the students, because the students haven't left yet. The query is to know the iceberg that the X_i-th student would take, assuming only the professor's records in [L,R] are occupied.

                //   Therefore, we don't mark the students' occupations in the DSU.

                //   So when we do find(1) for the first student, we get the first unoccupied (which is 1 if not occupied by the professor, or the next available). Then for the second student, we do find(2) or find(current+1) which is find(2) if the first was 1, but we did not mark 1 as occupied? So we get 2 if available? 

                //   This is not correct: because the students are taking the icebergs one by one. But the problem does not say that the students are part of the professor's records. The query is: what would be the iceberg of the X_i-th student? We need to simulate the students as well? 

                //   However, the problem states: "they wish to determine the furthest iceburg that any of them will end up at" and they are a group of X_i piplups, so they take the first X_i unoccupied icebergs. And the X_i-th one is the answer.

                //   We can compute the X_i-th unoccupied iceberg in the set of icebergs that are not occupied by the professor's records in [L,R]. This is equivalent to: 
                //        Let S = set of occupied icebergs by the professor's records in [L,R].
                //        Then the students take the first X_i icebergs in the complement of S.

                //   Therefore, we don't need to simulate the students' occupation in the DSU? We only need to know the first X_i unoccupied icebergs.

                //   How to get the X_i-th unoccupied without simulate the takes? 
                //        We can do: 
                //            current = 0
                //            for i in range(X_i):
                //                current = find(current+1, U_bound)   // this gives the next unoccupied after current
                //            then output current.

                //   This works because the DSU has been updated only with the professor's records. The students are not affecting the DSU.

                //   But note: if the X_i-th unoccupied is beyond U_bound, then we don't have the DSU set for that? But as described, for x>U_bound, find(x, U_bound) returns x. And that is correct.

                //   Therefore, we output current.

                cout << current << '\n';

   However, we must be cautious: the professor's records might have caused the DSU to be updated only for the range [1, U_bound]. The students simulation might start at 1 and then if the first unoccupied is beyond U_bound, we get a number beyond U_bound, which is correct.

   Let's test with the sample: 
        Input: 
            5 4
            1 3 2 4 5 
            1 2 4 2   -> L=2, R=4, X_i=2

        A[1]=3, A[2]=2, A[3]=4.

        U_bound = (4-2+1) + 1000 = 3+1000=1003.

        Process day2 (index1): x=3
            find(3): 
                if timestamp[3]!=now -> reset to 3, then return 3.
                then set next_ptr[3] = find(4,1003)
                for 4: reset to 4 -> then set next_ptr[4] = find(5,1003) -> reset to 5, then next_ptr[5]=find(6,1003)=6? 
                Actually, we do:
                    find(4): reset to 4, then set next_ptr[4]=find(5) -> then for 5: reset to 5, then set next_ptr[5]=find(6) -> which returns 6? (because 6<=1003, so reset to 6? then set next_ptr[6]=find(7)=7? ... but we are not storing beyond 1003? 

        But we don't need to store beyond 1003? For the professor's record, we only care if the assignment is within [1,1003]. 

        Actually, we do: 
            for x=3: we get y=3 (because 3 is unvisited). Then we set next_ptr[3]=find(4). 
            Then we go to 4: unvisited -> set next_ptr[4]=find(5) -> then 5: unvisited -> set next_ptr[5]=find(6) -> ... until we get to 1004? 

        This is a chain of 1000 steps? That is too slow.

   We must avoid this.

   How to avoid the chain? 

        We can modify the find function to not reset beyond U_bound? But the problem is that we are calling find(4) and then we reset 4, then we call find(5) and reset 5, etc. until 1003? Then for 1004, we return 1004.

        And then we set next_ptr[3] = 1004? Then next time we start at 3, we jump to 1004.

        But then the next record: 
            A[2]=2: 
                find(2): reset to 2 -> then set next_ptr[2]=find(3)=? 
                But 3 is visited: we do find(3) = find(next_ptr[3]) = find(1004) -> which is 1004? because 1004>U_bound? 

        Actually, in the find function: 
            if (x > U_bound) return x;   // so we don't reset beyond U_bound.

        So we can pass U_bound to the find function and if x>U_bound, we return x without resetting.

        Then for the first record (x=3):
            y = 3.
            then we set next_ptr[3] = find(4, U_bound) -> then we reset 4? Then we set next_ptr[4]=find(5,U_bound) ... until we get to U_bound+1? 

        This is a chain of 1000 steps? That's acceptable? Because U_bound = len+1000, so the gap from 3 to U_bound+1 is 1001 steps? And len is 3, so 1001 steps per record? Then 3 records: 3003 steps? Then for a query with len=10^6, worst-case we do 10^6 * 1000 = 1e9 per query? 5000 queries -> 5e12, too slow.

   We must avoid the chain in the union step.

   How about: when we set next_ptr[y] = find(y+1, U_bound), we don't need to do it recursively for the entire chain? We only need to set it to the next available beyond y. But if we know that the next available beyond y is not stored, we can set it to the next known available? 

   Actually, we can break the chain: 
        if y+1 > U_bound, then next_ptr[y] = y+1.
        else, next_ptr[y] = find(y+1, U_bound)

   But then if y+1 is unvisited, we reset it and then we set next_ptr[y] = y+1? 

   This is what we are doing. And it's a recursive call. 

   To avoid the long chain, we can rely on the fact that if the next available is beyond U_bound, we set next_ptr[y] = y+1? But then if we start at y+1 later, we would get y+1 and then set next_ptr[y+1] = y+2, etc.

   We can do: 
        next_ptr[y] = (y+1 > U_bound) ? (y+1) : find(y+1, U_bound);

   But then we avoid the recursive call for the entire chain? But if y+1 is within U_bound, we call find(y+1) which might call find(y+2) recursively? 

   How to break the recursion? We cannot.

   But note: we are only going to do one step per assignment? Then the total work per assignment is O(1) if the next available is beyond U_bound? But if the next available is within U_bound, then we do one call, which might lead to a chain? 

   Actually, the next available might be far away? 

   We need to avoid the deep recursion.

   We can do iterative if the gap is large? 

   Alternative: 
        We know that the next available is either y+1 or we have to skip a contiguous segment of taken nodes? But we haven't processed the taken nodes beyond y+1 yet? 

        Actually, we are processing the records sequentially. We haven't processed the records that start at y+1? So y+1 is initially unvisited? 

        Therefore, for an unvisited node, we set next_ptr[y+1]=y+1, so find(y+1) returns y+1. Then we set next_ptr[y] = y+1.

        Then the next record that starts at y: 
            find(y) = find(next_ptr[y]) = find(y+1) = y+1? 

        So we don't need to recursively call for the entire chain? 

        Then why did we get a chain for the first record? Because we did:
            next_ptr[3] = find(4) -> which we reset 4 and then set next_ptr[4]=find(5) -> reset 5 and set next_ptr[5]=find(6) -> ... until find(1004) which returns 1004.

        And then next_ptr[3]=1004.

        Then the next record starting at 2: 
            find(2) -> reset to 2, then next_ptr[2]=find(3)= find(1004) = 1004.

        Then the next record starting at 4:
            find(4) -> but 4 is visited? Then we do find(4)=find(next_ptr[4])=find(5)=? 
            next_ptr[4] = 5? Then find(5)=? next_ptr[5]=6, ... until 1004.

        This chain of 1000 steps for the record starting at 4? 

   To avoid this, we should compress the path in the find function for nodes within U_bound.

   Our find function with path compression:

        int find(int x, int U) {
            if (x > U) {
                return x;
            }
            if (timestamp[x] != now) {
                timestamp[x] = now;
                next_ptr[x] = x;   // initially, x is available, points to itself
            }
            if (next_ptr[x] != x) {
                next_ptr[x] = find(next_ptr[x], U);   // path compression
            }
            return next_ptr[x];
        }

   Then in the first record (x=3):
        find(3): reset to 3, then next_ptr[3]=3 -> then we set next_ptr[3] = find(4,U) -> 
        find(4): reset to 4, then next_ptr[4]=4 -> then we set next_ptr[3]=4? 
        Then we set next_ptr[3]=4.

        Then we mark 3 as taken: we set next_ptr[3] = find(4,U) -> which we just did and got 4? So next_ptr[3]=4.

        Then the next record (x=2):
            find(2): reset to 2, then next_ptr[2]=2 -> then we set next_ptr[2]=find(3,U)= find(4) (because next_ptr[3]=4) -> 
            find(4): we have next_ptr[4]=4, so we return 4? 
            Then we set next_ptr[2]=4? and then we set next_ptr[4]=find(5,U) -> 
            find(5): reset to 5, then next_ptr[5]=5, so we return 5? Then next_ptr[4]=5.

        Then the next record (x=4):
            find(4): next_ptr[4]=5 -> then we do find(5) = 5? Then we set next_ptr[4]=5 (already set) and then we set next_ptr[5]=find(6,U) -> reset 6, then next_ptr[6]=6, then next_ptr[5]=6.

        This still does a chain for the assignment: for each taken node we do one step to the next, and then we set next_ptr[node] to the next available. And the find with path compression will collapse the entire chain? 

        For example, if we have taken 3,4,5, then:
            next_ptr[3]=4, next_ptr[4]=5, next_ptr[5]=6.
        Then when we start at 3: 
            find(3): next_ptr[3]=4, then find(4)=? 
            find(4): next_ptr[4]=5, then find(5)=? 
            find(5): next_ptr[5]=6, then find(6)=6.
            Then we set next_ptr[5]=6, and then next_ptr[4]=6 (by path compression), and then next_ptr[3]=6.

        So the next time we start at 3, we jump to 6 in one step.

        Therefore, the amortized cost per find is O(α(U_bound)).

   But note: the first time we process a record that starts in the middle of a taken segment, we might have to walk the entire chain. However, the total distinct nodes touched in the entire query is the number of taken nodes plus the number of nodes in the chain we walk? But the chain walking: initially the nodes are unvisited, so we only visit the ones we assign and the ones we skip in the chain? And we set their next_ptr to the next available. Then the next time we start in the taken segment, we jump in one step to the next available.

   Therefore, the total work for the professor's records in one query is O(len * α(U_bound))? 

   And then the students: O(X_i) which is 500 per query.

   Total work over all queries: sum_{query} (len_i * α(1001000) + 500) 
        = (sum of len_i) * α(1001000) + 500 * M.

   The worst-case sum of len_i: 5000 * 10^6 = 5e9, and α(1001000) is about 5, so 25e9, which is 25 billion operations, which in C++ might be borderline in 2 seconds.

   But note: we are only doing integer array accesses and the constant factors are low. And the path compression is not exactly iterating 5 times, it is the amortized constant.

   However, 25e9 operations might be too slow.

   We must hope that the average len_i is small? Or we must optimize further.

   Given the constraints (M<=5000) and the worst-case len_i=10^6, we cannot avoid the worst-case total work of 5e9 * constant. We must hope that the constant is low.

   Alternatively, we can try to bound the total work by the number of distinct nodes touched. In one query, we only touch at most len_i + 1000 + X_i nodes. And the sum over queries of (len_i + 1000 + 500) = (sum of len_i) + 5000 * 1500.

   In the worst-case, sum of len_i = 5000 * 10^6 = 5e9, and 5000*1500=7.5e6, so total nodes touched: 5e9+7.5e6, which is about 5e9.

   But each node touch is a few instructions (check timestamp, set next_ptr, recursive call?).

   We will implement and hope that the machine is fast.

   Or we can try to optimize by increasing the timestamp reset: we only reset a node if it was touched in a previous query? We are already doing that with the timestamp.

   We will implement as described.

   Let's test with the sample: 
        Query1: L=2, R=4, X_i=2.

        now = 1.
        Professor's records:
            j=1 (0-indexed index1): A[1]=3
                find(3,1003): timestamp[3]!=1 -> set to 1, next_ptr[3]=3 -> return 3.
                then next_ptr[3] = find(4,1003)
                    find(4,1003): timestamp[4]!=1 -> set to 1, next_ptr[4]=4 -> return 4.
                so next_ptr[3]=4.
            j=2: A[2]=2
                find(2,1003): reset to 1, next_ptr[2]=2 -> return 2.
                then next_ptr[2] = find(3,1003) = 4? 
            j=3: A[3]=4
                find(4,1003): next_ptr[4]=4 -> return 4.
                then next_ptr[4] = find(5,1003) -> reset 5, next_ptr[5]=5 -> return 5.

        Then the set of occupied: 3,2,4 -> but we assigned: day2:3, day3:2, day4:4 -> so the unoccupied icebergs: 1,5,6,...
        Then the students: 
            first: find(0+1)=find(1): reset to 1, next_ptr[1]=1 -> so first unoccupied=1.
            second: find(1+1)=find(2): next_ptr[2]=4 -> so we do find(4)=4? But 4 is occupied? 
                But wait, we did not reset 1 in the professor's records? We only reset the ones we visited: 2,3,4,5.

        For the students simulation, we are using the same DSU. But the DSU has been updated by the professor's records: 
            next_ptr[3]=4, next_ptr[2]=4, next_ptr[4]=5, next_ptr[5]=5.
            And we haven't touched 1.

        So find(1): 
            timestamp[1]!=now (which is 1) -> reset to 1, next_ptr[1]=1, so return 1.

        Then find(2): 
            next_ptr[2]=4, then we do find(4)=5? 
            because next_ptr[4]=5, and then find(5)=5? so we set next_ptr[2]=5? and return 5.

        Then the second student gets 5.

        Output: 5 -> matches.

        Then the next query: update: set A[2-1]=A[1] to 1. So A[1]=1.
        Then query: L=1, R=3, X_i=2.
        Professor's records: 
            j=0: A[0]=1 -> find(1,1003): reset to now=2, next_ptr[1]=1 -> return 1.
                     then next_ptr[1] = find(2,1003) -> reset to 2, next_ptr[2]=2 -> return 2.
            j=1: A[1]=1 -> find(1,1003): next_ptr[1]=2 -> then find(2)=2? -> return 2.
                     then next_ptr[2]=find(3,1003) -> reset to 2, next_ptr[3]=3 -> return 3.
            j=2: A[2]=2 -> find(2,1003): next_ptr[2]=3 -> find(3)=3 -> return 3.
                     then next_ptr[3]=find(4,1003)=4.

        Then the occupied: 1,2,3.
        Students: 
            first: find(1) -> next_ptr[1]=2 -> then find(2)=3? then find(3)=4? -> wait, but the DSU for the students simulation: 
            We haven't reset the DSU? We are using the same DSU for the professor's records? 
            But now=2, so we reset the nodes we visit.

            Actually, we did a now++ at the beginning of the query? Then the professor's records used now=2. Then the students simulation also uses now=2? But the nodes 1,2,3,4 have been set in the professor's records? 

            So for the students simulation: 
                current=0.
                first: find(1) -> 
                    if timestamp[1]!=2? But we set it to 2 in the professor's records -> then we see next_ptr[1]=2, then we do find(2)= find(next_ptr[2]=3) = find(3)= find(4)=4? 
                    so we return 4? 
                second: find(4+1)=find(5) -> reset to 2, next_ptr[5]=5, return 5.

            So we output 5.

        But the unoccupied icebergs are: 4,5,6,... so the first student should take 4, the second 5 -> output 5.

        Matches.

        Then the last query: L=1, R=5, X_i=10.
        We update: A[0]=1, A[1]=1, A[2]=2, A[3]=4, A[4]=5.

        U_bound = 5+1000=1005.

        Professor's records: 
            j0:1 -> assigned 1 -> next_ptr[1]=find(2)=2 -> but then we set next_ptr[1]=2.
            j1:1 -> find(1)=find(2)=2 -> then set next_ptr[2]=find(3)=3.
            j2:2 -> find(2)=find(3)=3 -> set next_ptr[3]=find(4)=4.
            j3:4 -> find(4)=4 -> set next_ptr[4]=find(5)=5.
            j4:5 -> find(5)=5 -> set next_ptr[5]=find(6)=6.

        Occupied: 1,2,3,4,5 -> unoccupied: 6,7,..., and then 1 is taken? 

        The unoccupied icebergs: 6,7,8,..., then the 10th unoccupied is 6+9=15.

        Students: 
            current=0
            step1: find(1) -> next_ptr[1]=2, then find(2)=3, then find(3)=4, then find(4)=5, then find(5)=6? -> returns 6.
            step2: find(7) -> reset to now=3, next_ptr[7]=7 -> returns 7.
            step3: find(8)=8
            ... until step10: 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15.

        But the first unoccupied is 6? Then the 10th is 15.

        However, we do:

            current = 0
            step1: current = find(1) -> which returns 6? 
            step2: current = find(6+1)=find(7) -> returns 7.
            step3: find(8) -> 8.
            ...
            step10: find(15) -> returns 15.

        So output 15.

   Therefore, we will implement as described.

   Note: we must pass U_bound to the find function.

   Let's code accordingly.

   We set MAX_U = 1001000 (which is 10^6+1000, but note: the maximum U_bound we use is 10^6+1000, and 10^6+1000 = 1001000).

   But note: the first query has len=3, so U_bound=3+1000=1003, and we access indices up to 1003? Then the next query has len=3, U_bound=1003? Then the last query has len=5, U_bound=1005.

   We have a global array of size 1001000+? We define MAX_U = 1001000.

   We also note: we use indices from 1 to U_bound, and we also use 0? We use 0 in the students simulation: we start at 0, then find(0+1).

   We must make sure our arrays next_ptr and timestamp are defined for indices from 0 to MAX_U.

   We set:
        #define MAX_U 1001000

   And then arrays: next_ptr[MAX_U+1] and timestamp[MAX_U+1]? But we also need to cover up to MAX_U? And also beyond? But our find function for x>U_bound returns x without using the array.

   We will run and hope.

   Let's hope that the worst-case total work (5e9) runs in 2 seconds? 

   But 5e9 operations might be 5 seconds in C++. We need to optimize the inner loop.

   We can try to use iterative path compression? Or hope that the compiler optimizes.

   Alternatively, we can avoid the recursion in find? 

   We can do iterative:

        int find(int x, int U) {
            if (x > U) {
                return x;
            }
            int root = x;
            // traverse to the root
            vector<int> path;
            while (root <= U) {
                if (timestamp[root] != now) {
                    break;
                }
                if (next_ptr[root] == root) {
                    break;
                }
                path.push_back(root);
                root = next_ptr[root];
            }
            if (root <= U && timestamp[root] != now) {
                timestamp[root] = now;
                next_ptr[root] = root;
            }
            // Now, root might be > U, then we return root.
            // But we also want to compress the path.
            for (int node : path) {
                next_ptr[node] = root;
            }
            return root;
        }

   But this is not recursive and might be faster? And we avoid stack overflow.

   However, the worst-case length of the path is 1000, so we can do.

   But the total work might be the same.

   We'll implement the recursive with path compression and hope.

   Given the constraints, we hope that the average chain length is short.

   But the worst-case chain length in one find is the length of the consecutive taken segment? which can be 1000? and then the recursion depth is 1000? which might cause stack overflow? 

   We change to iterative.

   Steps for iterative find:

        int find(int x, int U) {
            if (x > U) {
                return x;
            }
            // Check if we need to reset this node
            if (timestamp[x] != now) {
                timestamp[x] = now;
                next_ptr[x] = x;
            }
            // Now, we want to find the root of the set that contains x.
            vector<int> path;
            int cur = x;
            while (cur <= U) {
                if (timestamp[cur] != now) {
                    // This node has not been visited in this query: it is available, so it is the root.
                    break;
                }
                if (next_ptr[cur] == cur) {
                    break;
                }
                path.push_back(cur);
                cur = next_ptr[cur];
            }
            // Now, if cur is within U and not reset, reset it.
            if (cur <= U && timestamp[cur] != now) {
                timestamp[cur] = now;
                next_ptr[cur] = cur;
            }
            // Now, the root is cur.
            // But note: cur might be beyond U? Then we return cur.
            // Compress the path: set all nodes in the path to point to cur.
            for (int node : path) {
                next_ptr[node] = cur;
            }
            return cur;
        }

   But we don't want to use vector because it is slow.

   Alternatively, we can do without storing the entire path? 

        int find(int x, int U) {
            if (x > U) {
                return x;
            }
            if (timestamp[x] != now) {
                timestamp[x] = now;
                next_ptr[x] = x;
                return x;
            }
            int root = x;
            while (root <= U && timestamp[root] == now && next_ptr[root] != root) {
                root = next_ptr[root];
            }
            if (root <= U) {
                if (timestamp[root] != now) {
                    timestamp[root] = now;
                    next_ptr[root] = root;
                } else {
                    while (root <= U && next_ptr[root] != root) {
                        root = next_ptr[root];
                    }
                    if (root <= U && timestamp[root] != now) {
                        timestamp[root] = now;
                        next_ptr[root] = root;
                    }
                }
            }
            // Now compress: we don't have the entire path.
            // We can do: set next_ptr[x] = root, but we don't have the intermediates.
            // We didn't store the path.

        }

   This doesn't do path compression for intermediates.

   Given the time, we will use the iterative method with an array of size 1000 for the path? Because the maximum chain is at most the gap from x to the next available, and we are bounded by U_bound - x <= 1000? 

   Actually, the maximum gap we might walk is 1000? Because we set U_bound = len+1000, and the next available must be within U_bound or beyond. And if we start at x, we will find an available within at most 1000 steps? 

   Why? Because the professor's records have only occupied len icebergs, so in the range [x, x+1000] there is at least one available? 

   But note: it is possible that the entire range [x, x+1000-1] is occupied, then the next available is x+1000? So we walk 1000 steps.

   Therefore, the maximum chain length is 1000.

   We can do:

        int find(int x, int U) {
            if (x > U) {
                return x;
            }
            vector<int> path;
            int current = x;
            while (true) {
                if (current > U) {
                    break;
                }
                if (timestamp[current] != now) {
                    timestamp[current] = now;
                    next_ptr[current] = current;
                    break;
                }
                if (next_ptr[current] == current) {
                    break;
                }
                path.push_back(current);
                current = next_ptr[current];
            }
            // Now, if current<=U and not set? We set it above if it was unvisited.
            // But if it was visited, then we have next_ptr[current] might not be current? Actually, we break at a node that is either beyond U, or unvisited (which we then set), or visited and is a root (next_ptr[current]==current).

            // But in the visited and root case, we break and 'current' is the root.

            // Compress the path: set all nodes in the path to point to 'current'
            for (int node : path) {
                next_ptr[node] = current;
            }
            return current;
        }

   But using a vector might be slow. We can use a fixed-size array because the maximum path length is 1000.

   Or we can do without storing the entire path? We can do iterative path compression in a second pass? We don't care as long as we have a bound of 1000.

   However, the entire simulation for one query: we do for each professor's record one find (which might be 1000 steps) and one union (which is one more find). And the total work per record is 2000? Then for len=10^6, we do 10^6 * 2000 = 2e9 per query, 5000 queries -> 10e12, which is too slow.

   Therefore, we must use the recursive find with path compression that is amortized constant.

   And hope that the average is good.

   Alternatively, the bounded range might help: because the next available is always within 1000 steps, we can do a while loop for the entire chain without storing the path for compression? 

        int find(int x, int U) {
            if (x > U) {
                return x;
            }
            // If the node is not in this query, initialize it.
            if (timestamp[x] != now) {
                timestamp[x] = now;
                next_ptr[x] = x; // initially available
            }
            int root = x;
            // Find the root.
            while (root <= U && next_ptr[root] != root) {
                root = next_ptr[root];
            }
            if (root > U) {
                return root;
            }
            // Make sure the root is initialized.
            if (timestamp[root] != now) {
                timestamp[root] = now;
                next_ptr[root] = root;
            }
            // Path compression: we don't store the path, but we can compress from x to root.
            int temp = x;
            while (temp != root) {
                int next_temp = next_ptr[temp];
                next_ptr[temp] = root;
                temp = next_temp;
            }
            return root;
        }

   This is iterative and does path compression.

   Let's test with a small example.

   But note: this will work if the entire chain is within U. For beyond U, we return immediately.

   We try: 
        next_ptr[3]=4, next_ptr[4]=5, next_ptr[5]=5 (root).
        find(3,U):
            root = 3 -> then next_ptr[3]!=3 -> go to 4.
            at 4: next_ptr[4]!=4 -> go to 5.
            at 5: next_ptr[5]==5 -> root=5.
            then we compress: 
                temp=3, next_temp = next_ptr[3]=4.
                next_ptr[3]=5.
                temp=4, next_temp=next_ptr[4]=5.
                next_ptr[4]=5.
                temp=5, break.
            return 5.

   This is correct.

   We will implement this iterative find with two passes: one to find the root, and one to compress.

   We hope that the length of the chain is at most 1000, so the two passes are O(1000) per find? Then the total work per query is O(len_i * 1000) = 10^6 * 1000 = 1e9 per query, 5000 queries = 5e12, too slow.

   Therefore, we must use the amortized constant time union-find. 

   After careful thought, the union-find with union by rank is not necessary because we are not unioning arbitrary sets, but we are only unioning contiguous intervals? 

   Given the time, we will output the recursive find with path compression and hope that the average is very good.

   Implement recursive:

        int find(int x, int U) {
            if (x > U) {
                return x;
            }
            if (timestamp[x] != now) {
                timestamp[x] = now;
                next_ptr[x] = x;
            }
            if (next_ptr[x] != x) {
                next_ptr[x] = find(next_ptr[x], U);
            }
            return next_ptr[x];
        }

   And hope that the depth of the recursion is not too large. The maximum recursion depth might be 1000, which is acceptable.

   But 1000 recursion depth for 5e9 calls? The overhead of function calls might be heavy.

   We change to iterative using a stack? 

   Given the bound of 1000, we can do:

        int find(int x, int U) {
            if (x > U) {
                return x;
            }
            vector<int> stack;
            int cur = x;
            while (cur <= U) {
                if (timestamp[cur] != now) {
                    timestamp[cur] = now;
                    next_ptr[cur] = cur;
                    break;
                }
                if (next_ptr[cur] == cur) {
                    break;
                }
                stack.push_back(cur);
                cur = next_ptr[cur];
            }
            if (cur > U) {
                // Then the root is cur.
                for (int node : stack) {
                    next_ptr[node] = cur;
                }
                return cur;
            }
            // Now, if within U, we have set it if necessary, and it is a root.
            int root = cur;
            for (int i = stack.size()-1; i>=0; i--) {
                next_ptr[stack[i]] = root;
            }
            return root;
        }

   This is iterative and avoids deep recursion.

   Let's test: 
        next_ptr[3]=4, next_ptr[4]=5, next_ptr[5]=5.
        find(3,U):
            stack: [3]
            then cur=4 -> then stack=[3,4]
            then cur=5: at 5, we break because next_ptr[5]==5.
            then we set next_ptr[4]=5, then next_ptr[3]=5.
            return 5.

   Correct.

   We will implement this iterative find.

   Summary of the code for a type1 query:

        now++;
        len = R-L+1;
        U_bound = len + 1000;
        for j in [L-1, R-1]:
            x = A[j]
            y = find(x, U_bound)
            if y <= U_bound:
                next_ptr[y] = find(y+1, U_bound)   // this marks y as taken by setting next_ptr[y] to the next available
        // Then simulate the students:
        current = 0
        for i in range(X_i):
            current = find(current+1, U_bound)
        output current

   Note: the find function is iterative as described.

   We'll code accordingly.

   Let's hope it's fast enough.

   Note: worst-case total work in one query: 
        For the professor's records: each record does two find calls. 
        The first find(x) might walk a chain of length at most 1000, and then the find(y+1) might walk a chain of length at most 1000? 
        Then per record: 2000 steps? 
        Then for len=10^6, we do 10^6 * 2000 = 2e9 per query? 
        5000 queries -> 10e12, which is too slow.

   But note: the bound on the chain length is not the entire U_bound, but the gap from x to the next available. And the next available is within at most 1000 steps? 

   Why within 1000 steps? Because we are in a bounded range of U_bound = len+1000, and there are only len occupied, so in any interval of length 1000 there is an available? 

   Therefore, the chain length for any find is at most 1000.

   But then the total work per query is 2 * len * 1000 = 2e9 for len=10^6, and 5000 queries would be 10e12, which is 10,000 seconds.

   This is not acceptable.

   We must have a find that is amortized constant per operation.

   The iterative path compression we implemented does:

        In the first find for a chain of length L, we do L steps and then compress the entire chain to point to the root.

        Then the next find for any node in the chain will be O(1).

   Therefore, the total work for the entire query is the sum of the lengths of the chains for the very first time they are visited, plus the number of find operations.

   But note: the only nodes visited are the ones in the chain from the starting value to the next available, and these are distinct per chain. 

   The total number of distinct nodes touched in the entire query is at most the number of occupied nodes plus the nodes in the gaps we skip? And the total is U_bound = len+1000.

   And then the work for all find operations in the query is O(U_bound) because each node is visited at most once in the first pass and then once in the compression pass? 

   Therefore, the total work for the professor's records is O(U_bound) per query.

   Then the total work over all queries is sum_{query} (U_bound) = sum_{query} (len_i + 1000) = (sum of len_i) + 5000*1000.

   In the worst-case, sum of len_i = 5000 * 10^6 = 5e9, and 5000*1000=5e6, so total 5.005e9, which is acceptable in C++ if we can do 5e9 memory accesses in 2 seconds? It might be borderline.

   But note: each find operation for the students: we do X_i=500 steps, and each find in the students part might also walk a chain? But the students part: 
        for i=0 to X_i-1:
            current = find(current+1, U_bound)

        Each find might be O(1) amortized because we may have visited the node before? 

        But the students are not marking the node as taken, so the DSU state does not change.

        And the nodes in the students part might be the ones we haven't visited in the professor's part? 

        For example, the node 1 might not be visited in the professor's part, then the first find(1) in the students will reset it and set next_ptr[1]=1, then return 1.
        Then the next find(2) might be unvisited, so reset and return 2.

        So for an unvisited node, we do O(1) work.

        For a visited node (by the professor's part), we get next_ptr in O(1) because of path compression.

        Therefore, the students part is O(X_i) per query.

   Therefore, the total work per query is O(len_i + 1000 + X_i) = O(len_i+1000) [since X_i<=500].

   Then the worst-case total work over all queries: sum (len_i) + 5000 * 1500 = 5e9 + 7.5e6.

   We will implement accordingly.

   Let's code accordingly.

   Note: we must be cautious to not use recursion to avoid stack overflow.

   We have already made the find iterative.

   Let's hope.
