### Approach
The problem requires counting the number of valid gardens (colorings of an \( N \times N \) grid with each cell being empty, blue, or red) such that there exists a "good" path from the top-left to the bottom-right corner. The path must be monotonic (only moving right or down) and must split the grid into two regions: the top-right region (above the path) containing only empty or blue cells, and the bottom-left region (below the path) containing only empty or red cells.

#### Key Insight
The existence of a good path imposes constraints on the grid:
1. **Above the Path**: Every cell must be either empty or blue (no red cells).
2. **Below the Path**: Every cell must be either empty or red (no blue cells).

The path is a non-decreasing sequence of vertical edges \( c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_N \) where \( c_0 = 0 \), \( c_N = N \), and for each row \( i \) (0 to \( N-1 \)), the vertical edge \( c_{i+1} \) must satisfy constraints derived from the grid:
- \( c_{i+1} \) must be greater than the maximum column index of any blue cell in row \( i \) (if any blue cells exist).
- \( c_{i+1} \) must be less than or equal to the minimum column index of any red cell in row \( i \) (if any red cells exist).

#### Dynamic Programming Solution
We use dynamic programming to count the valid gardens. The state \( dp[i][j] \) represents the number of ways to color the first \( i \) rows such that the vertical edge at the bottom of the \( i \)-th row is at column \( j \). The recurrence involves:
1. **Prefix Sums**: For efficient computation of the sum over previous states.
2. **Row Coloring**: For each row, the number of valid colorings given a vertical edge \( j \) is \( 2^N \) (since each cell in the row can be chosen independently to satisfy the region constraints).

#### Algorithm
1. **Initialization**: \( dp[0] = 1 \) (starting at column 0).
2. **Iterate Over Rows**: For each row \( i \) from 0 to \( N-1 \):
   - Compute prefix sums of the current DP state.
   - Update the next DP state: \( new\_dp[j] = 2^N \times \text{prefix}[j] \), where \( \text{prefix}[j] \) is the sum of \( dp[k] \) for \( 0 \leq k \leq j \).
3. **Result**: The answer is \( dp[N] \), representing the number of valid paths ending at column \( N \).

### Solution Code
```python
MOD = 1000003233

def main():
    import sys
    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    pow_2_n = pow(2, n, MOD)
    for _ in range(n):
        new_dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        prefix = 0
        for j in range(n + 1):
            prefix = (prefix + dp[j]) % MOD
            new_dp[j] = prefix * pow_2_n % MOD
        dp = new_dp
    print(dp[n] % MOD)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: The initial state \( dp[0] = 1 \) sets the starting point at column 0.
2. **Processing Rows**: For each row:
   - **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sum up to column \( j \) accumulates the number of valid paths ending at or before \( j \) from the previous row.
   - **State Update**: The new state for each column \( j \) is computed as the product of the prefix sum (sum of valid paths up to \( j \)) and \( 2^N \) (number of valid colorings for the current row given the vertical edge at \( j \)).
3. **Result Extraction**: After processing all rows, \( dp[n] \) gives the count of valid paths ending at column \( N \), which is the solution modulo \( 10^9 + 3233 \).

This approach efficiently counts the valid gardens by leveraging dynamic programming and prefix sums, ensuring optimal performance even for large \( N \) (up to 2500). The complexity is \( O(N^2) \), which is feasible given the constraints.
