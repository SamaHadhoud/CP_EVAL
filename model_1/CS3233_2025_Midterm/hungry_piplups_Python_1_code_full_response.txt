To solve this problem, we need to efficiently handle two types of queries on an array of integers: updates to the array and queries that determine the position of the X-th Piplup (the X-th smallest unoccupied iceberg) considering only migrations within a specified range of days. The key challenge is to process these queries efficiently given the constraints.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - **Migrations Simulation**: For each day in a query range, a Piplup starts at a specified iceberg. If occupied, it moves to the next unoccupied iceberg. The set of occupied icebergs after processing the range is needed to answer the query.
   - **Queries**: For a given range of days and a number X, find the X-th smallest unoccupied iceberg (where the students will settle).
   - **Updates**: Modify the starting iceberg for a specific day.

2. **Key Insights**:
   - **Bounded Simulation**: The starting icebergs are small (1 to 500), so the occupied positions can be bounded (up to the range length + 1000).
   - **Efficient Occupancy Tracking**: Use a Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union, DSU) data structure with path compression to quickly find the next available iceberg. The DSU is reset for each query using a timestamp-based lazy initialization.
   - **Frequency Handling**: For each query, count frequencies of starting values in the range using Fenwick Trees (Binary Indexed Trees) for efficient range sum queries.

3. **Algorithm Selection**:
   - **Fenwick Trees**: Precompute and maintain frequency counts of starting values (1 to 500) for efficient range sum queries.
   - **DSU with Lazy Initialization**: For each query, simulate migrations by processing frequencies. The DSU helps in quickly finding the next available iceberg. The X-th unoccupied iceberg is then found by traversing the DSU.

4. **Complexity Analysis**:
   - **Precomputation**: Building Fenwick Trees takes O(N log N) time.
   - **Updates**: Each update involves two Fenwick Tree operations (O(log N)).
   - **Queries**: For each query, processing frequencies takes O(500 log N) (for Fenwick Tree queries). The DSU operations take O(α(L)) per migration (where L is the range length), and finding the X-th unoccupied iceberg takes O(X) (X ≤ 500). Total time per query is O(L + 500 log N).

### Solution Code
```python
import sys

MAX_U = 1001000
next_ptr = list(range(MAX_U + 2))
timestamp = [0] * (MAX_U + 2)
now = 0

class FenwTree:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.n = size
        self.tree = [0] * (self.n + 1)

        if l > r:
            return 0
        return self.query(r) - self.query(l - 1)

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**:
   - **Global Arrays**: `next_ptr` and `timestamp` are initialized for the DSU to track the next available iceberg and query timestamps.
   - **Fenwick Trees**: For each starting value (1 to 500), a Fenwick Tree is built to count occurrences in any range efficiently.

2. **Updates**:
   - When updating a day's starting iceberg, the Fenwick Trees for the old and new values are adjusted to reflect the change.

3. **Queries**:
   - **Frequency Calculation**: For the specified range, frequencies of starting values (1 to 500) are obtained using Fenwick Trees.
   - **Migration Simulation**: Using the DSU, each migration is processed to mark occupied icebergs. The DSU's `find` function locates the next available iceberg efficiently.
   - **Finding X-th Unoccupied Iceberg**: The X-th smallest unoccupied iceberg is found by traversing the DSU from 1 upwards, skipping occupied positions.

This approach efficiently handles updates and queries by leveraging Fenwick Trees for frequency counts and a DSU with path compression for quick iceberg occupancy checks, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.
