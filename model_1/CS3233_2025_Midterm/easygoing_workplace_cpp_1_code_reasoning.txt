 Okay, we are given:
   N, K: the number of employees and the target number of employees that should do work.
   An array A[1..N] of work tolerance levels: for employee i, if when they arrive, at most A_i of their subordinates are already present and working, then they will work too.
   An array B[2..N]: for i from 2 to N, the direct superior of i is B_i.

 Note: The definition of subordinate includes both direct and indirect.

 The problem: find a permutation P of [1, N] such that when employees come in that order, exactly K employees work.

 How does an employee decide to work?
   When employee i arrives, they look at how many of their subordinates (in the entire tree) are already present and are working. If that count is at most A_i, then they work; otherwise, they slack.

 Important: Note that the condition only considers subordinates that are already present and that are working. Subordinates that are present but slacking are not counted.

 However, note that the condition does not require that the subordinates that are present are direct? It says "subordinate" meaning any in the entire subtree below. But note: when the employee arrives, only the subordinates that have arrived already are considered. And among those, only the ones that are working.

 How to approach?

 We note that the decision for an employee to work depends on the set of subordinates that have arrived before and are working. The order of non-subordinate employees (or superiors) might not affect an employee's decision? Actually, the condition only depends on the subordinates that are present and working.

 However, the problem is asking for a permutation that achieves exactly K employees working.

 We can think of the following:

   Let's define:
      Let T be the tree (with 1 as root).

   We can precompute the entire subtree for each node.

   How about we try to compute the minimum and maximum possible number of working employees?

   What is the maximum possible number of working employees?
      Consider: if we can arrange the order so that every employee works, then maximum is N.
      How to achieve maximum? We want each employee to see as few working subordinates as possible when they arrive. So we can arrange the order so that for each node, it arrives after as many non-subordinates as possible? Actually, we can arrange the order from the top (root) to the leaves? But note: the root has no superior and the condition for the root: when the root arrives, they see none of their subordinates? Actually, the root arrives first? Then they see no one? Then they will work if A_1>=0 (which it is). Then if we then bring the children of the root? But note: the condition for a child: when they arrive, they see the root? But the root is not a subordinate of the child. So actually, a child only sees subordinates that are below it? So for a child, the subordinates are the nodes in its own subtree.

   Actually, the condition for a node i: when i arrives, the only subordinates that can be present are those in the subtree of i that have arrived before. And if we can arrange the order so that for every node i, the number of working subordinates that have arrived before is <= A_i, then i will work.

   How to maximize the total working employees? We can try to make every node work. We can do a BFS-like order: start from the root, then the children, then the grandchildren, etc. However, when a node arrives, all its subordinates that are below it and have arrived are only the ones that are above it in the tree? Actually, no: if we do a BFS (level order), then when a node arrives, all its subordinates that are in the same branch and above? Actually, no: if we start from the root and then go to the children, then when a child arrives, the root is already present? But the root is not a subordinate of the child. So the child sees no subordinates? So the child will work if A_child>=0. Then when we go to a grandchild, it will see the child (if we do level order, the child is already present) but note: the child is a direct superior, not a subordinate? Actually, the grandchild's subordinates are the nodes in the subtree of the grandchild. So when the grandchild arrives, if we haven't brought any of its children (which we haven't in a top-down order), then it sees no subordinates? So it works.

   Therefore, if we traverse the tree in a top-down order (like BFS), every node will see at most 0 subordinates? Actually, if a node has children, then the children are not subordinates? Wait: the definition: 
        "employee b is a subordinate of employee a" if there is a chain from b to a of direct superiors. 
   So for node i, the subordinates are the nodes in the entire subtree of i? But note: the chain definition: for a, the chain would be from the subordinate (leaf) up to a? Actually, the problem says: 
        "employee b is a subordinate of employee a" if there is a sequence u_1=b, u_2, ... u_k=a such that for each i, u_{i+1} is the direct superior of u_i.

   This means that the relation is: b is a subordinate of a if and only if a is an ancestor of b? Yes.

   Therefore, when node i arrives, they look at the set of employees that are already present and are in the subtree of i? And among these, how many are working? Only the working ones are counted.

   In a BFS (top-down) order: 
        The root arrives first: no subordinate present -> works.
        Then the children of the root: when a child arrives, the root is present? But the root is not in the subtree of the child. So the child sees no subordinate? -> works.
        Then the grandchildren: when a grandchild arrives, its parent (the child of the root) is present? But the parent is not a subordinate of the grandchild? Actually, the parent is above the grandchild, so the grandchild's subordinates are the nodes below the grandchild. The parent is above? So the grandchild sees no subordinate? -> works.

   Therefore, in a top-down order, every node works? So maximum working is N.

   What about the minimum?
        We want to minimize the number of working employees.

        Consider: we can arrange the order to be bottom-up (like DFS postorder). Then when a leaf arrives, it sees no subordinate? -> works? But we don't want it to work? How to avoid a leaf working? The leaf has no subordinate, so if we bring the leaf at any time, when it arrives, it sees no subordinate -> so it will work if A_leaf>=0 (which it is). Therefore, every leaf must work? Actually, the condition: if at most A_i of the subordinates are working and present, then they work. For a leaf, there are no subordinates -> condition holds. So every leaf must work? Then the minimum cannot be less than the number of leaves?

        However, what if we bring a leaf after one of its superiors? But the condition for the leaf: it doesn't matter what the superior does? The leaf only looks at its own subordinates? So the leaf will always work.

        But what about non-leaves? 
            Suppose we bring a node i after all of its children. Then when i arrives, all of its children are present. And if the children worked, then the count of working subordinates that are present is the number of children that worked. So if the number of children that worked > A_i, then i will not work.

        Therefore, we can try to make a node not work by having more than A_i of its children working and then having the node come after the children.

        How to minimize the total working employees? We can design a DFS that processes the children first and then the parent. For each node, we can choose the order of the children arbitrarily.

        However, note: even if we do a bottom-up order, the leaves must work. Then for a node i: let the children have been processed. We know the working status of each child? Actually, we don't control the working status arbitrarily: the working status of a child is determined by the condition at the time the child arrived. But we can control the order of the entire permutation arbitrarily.

        Actually, we can do:

          We can compute for each node the minimum and maximum number of working employees in its subtree? But note: the entire permutation must be a permutation of all nodes. And the condition at a node depends on the working status of the subordinates that have arrived before.

        Alternatively, we can try to compute the set of achievable K.

        Steps:

          Let f(u) be the minimum number of working employees in the subtree of u that we can achieve? But note: the entire permutation is not limited to the subtree? The presence of non-subtree nodes might affect the condition? Actually, no: because when u arrives, the only subordinates that are present are the ones in the subtree of u that have arrived before. But the condition for u does not depend on non-subordinates. And for the nodes in the subtree of u, we can arrange their order arbitrarily? However, the condition for u depends on the working status of the subordinates that have arrived before. But the condition for the nodes in the subtree of u might be affected by the order in which they are arranged relative to each other and relative to u? 

          Actually, we can isolate the subtree: we can arrange the entire permutation arbitrarily. So we can arrange the subtree of u arbitrarily? But note: u must be placed at some position. The condition for u only depends on the nodes in the subtree of u that are placed before u. And the condition for a node in the subtree of u only depends on the nodes in the subtree of u that are placed before it? Actually, no: because the condition for a node in the subtree of u might also be affected by the presence of nodes outside the subtree? Actually, no: because a node v in the subtree of u only considers subordinates of v (which are in the subtree of v, hence in the subtree of u). So the condition for any node in the subtree of u is independent of nodes outside the subtree.

          Therefore, we can solve the problem for each subtree independently? 

          We can design a DP:

            Let:
               dp[u] = the minimum number of working employees that we can achieve in the entire subtree of u? 
                     But note: we are going to build a permutation for the entire subtree. However, the condition for u: we can choose to put u anywhere in the permutation of the subtree. And we can arrange the children arbitrarily.

          Alternatively, we can think:

            We know that if we arrange the subtree of u in a top-down order, then we get the maximum: all nodes work.

            If we arrange the subtree of u in a bottom-up order, then we get:

               For each child v, we process the entire subtree of v and then we put u. Then when u arrives, it sees all the working employees in its children subtrees. So the number of working subordinates that u sees is the sum of the working employees in the children subtrees? Actually, no: because the condition for u only counts the direct children? Actually, no: it counts every subordinate that is present and working. Since we have arranged the entire subtree of u (so all the descendants are present when u arrives) and they are working? Actually, not necessarily: we can arrange the subtree arbitrarily and we can make some of the children not work? 

          How about we design:

            We want to compute for a node u:

              Let x be the number of working employees in the entire subtree of u.

              Then when we place u at the end of the permutation for the subtree, the condition for u is: if the total working employees in the subtree of u (excluding u) is <= A[u], then u will work -> then x = (working in children subtrees) + 1. Otherwise, u doesn't work -> then x = (working in children subtrees).

          But note: the working in children subtrees are not independent: we can arrange arbitrarily the children and their subtrees? Actually, the condition for a node in a child's subtree does not depend on the other children? Because the subordinates of a node in a child's subtree are contained entirely in that child's subtree. Therefore, the entire subtree of u can be partitioned by the children.

          So we can do:

            Let u have children v1, v2, ... , vm.

            We can independently arrange each subtree of vi arbitrarily? And then we can interleave the permutations of the subtrees arbitrarily? And then we can put u at any position? Actually, we are going to form a permutation for the entire subtree of u by combining the permutations of the subtrees of the children and then inserting u somewhere.

          However, note: the condition for u depends on the total number of working employees that are in the entire subtree (excluding u) that have arrived before u. So if we put u at the end, then we get: the entire subtree (excluding u) has arrived and the working count is the sum of the working employees in all children subtrees. Then u works if and only if (total_working_children <= A[u]).

          But we have freedom: we can put u not at the end. For example, if we put u at the beginning, then u arrives first and sees no one -> then u works. Then the rest of the subtree: we can arrange arbitrarily? And the condition for the rest is independent? Actually, the condition for a node in the subtree of u: when they arrive, u is present? But u is not in their subtree? So they don't count u? So the condition for the children is independent? Then we can compute the working employees for the children independently? Actually, no: the children might have u as a direct superior? But note: the condition for a child v: the subordinates of v are the nodes in the subtree of v. So when v arrives, u is present? But u is not a subordinate of v? So v doesn't care about u. So the entire subtree of v can be arranged arbitrarily? Then the total working employees in the subtree of u would be 1 (for u) plus the sum of the working employees in each child subtree.

          Therefore, we have two extremes:

            Option 1: put u first -> then u works, and then we can arrange the children arbitrarily. Then the total working = 1 + sum(working in each child subtree).

            Option 2: put u last -> then the working status of u is: if the total working employees in the children subtrees (which is the entire subtree excluding u) is <= A[u], then u works -> total = total_working_children + 1; otherwise, total = total_working_children.

          But note: we are not limited to these two options. We can put u anywhere in the permutation of the subtree. Then the condition for u: when u arrives, only the working employees that are in the subtree of u and have arrived before u are counted. How can we control that? We can delay the arrival of some of the children subtrees? 

          Actually, we can choose to put u at any position. Then the condition for u: the working employees that u sees is the sum of the working employees in the subtrees of the children that have been completely processed before u? Actually, no: we can interleave the subtrees arbitrarily. So the working employees that u sees is the total working employees that are in the subtree of u and are placed before u. We can avoid including entire subtrees? 

          We can break the subtree of u into parts: we can choose the order arbitrarily. The constraint: we can choose to have u at any position, and then the working employees that u sees is the sum of the working employees in the subtrees of the children that have been started and not necessarily finished? Actually, we can have partial subtrees? But note: the condition for u only counts the working employees that are present and are subordinates (so in the subtree) and have arrived before u. 

          How about we consider: we can process the children subtrees one by one? And we can insert u in the middle of processing the children subtrees. Then the working employees that u sees is the sum of the working employees in the subtrees that we have completely processed? Actually, no: we might have processed only part of a subtree. Then the working employees that are present from that subtree are only those that have been processed? And they are working? But note: the condition for a node in a subtree: if we have processed a node, then we know its working status. And the working status of a node does not change.

          Therefore, if we break the subtree of u arbitrarily, we can control the count that u sees by only including a portion of the working employees from the children subtrees.

          Specifically, we can process the children subtrees in any order and we can stop at any point to insert u. Then the working employees that u sees is the sum of the working employees from the children subtrees that have been processed entirely? Actually, we might have processed only part of a subtree? Then we get the working employees from the processed part of each subtree? But note: we cannot break a subtree arbitrarily? We must arrange the entire subtree arbitrarily? Actually, the entire permutation of the subtree of u is arbitrary? So we can interleave the nodes from different children arbitrarily? 

          However, note: we cannot break the dependency within a subtree? Actually, the condition for a node only depends on the subordinates that are present and working. And the subordinates of a node are entirely within its own subtree. So we can interleave arbitrarily the nodes from different children subtrees? 

          Therefore, for the subtree of u, we can control the set of working employees that arrive before u arbitrarily? Specifically, we can choose any subset S of working employees from the entire subtree (excluding u) as long as |S| <= (the total working employees in the subtree of u excluding u). Actually, we cannot exceed the total working employees that we choose to have in the subtree.

          But note: we are going to fix the entire arrangement and then the working status of each node is determined by the condition. However, we can design the arrangement to achieve a desired count for u.

          Alternatively, we can use a greedy approach:

            We want to achieve a total working count for the entire subtree of u that we can vary between a minimum and a maximum.

            Let:
               min_u: the minimum number of working employees we can achieve in the subtree of u.
               max_u: the maximum number of working employees we can achieve in the subtree of u.

            We know that if we put u first, then u works, and then we can independently minimize the rest? Then min_u = 1 + sum_{v in children} min_v.

            How about the maximum? max_u = 1 + sum_{v in children} max_v? Actually, if we put u first, then u works and we can maximize each child subtree? Then yes.

            How about if we put u last? Then the working status of u is: if the total working employees in the children subtrees (which we can vary) is <= A[u], then u works -> then total = total_children + 1; else, total = total_children.

            But we can also put u in the middle? Then the working employees that u sees is not the entire children subtrees? We can choose to include only a subset of the working employees from the children subtrees? Specifically, we can choose the total working employees that appear before u arbitrarily between 0 and the total_children (the total working employees in the children subtrees). But note: we cannot change the total working employees in the children subtrees arbitrarily? We have fixed the arrangement for the children subtrees? Actually, we have freedom to choose the arrangement arbitrarily? Then we can choose the working employees that appear before u to be any number between 0 and total_children? 

            However, we cannot change the working status of the nodes arbitrarily: the working status of a node is fixed by the condition when it arrives. And the condition is deterministic: we cannot arbitrarily set a node to work or not? 

            Actually, we can control the working status by the arrangement? But the working status is determined by the condition. However, we have two possibilities for the entire subtree: we can choose the arrangement to get a particular total working count for the subtree? Then we are going to compute the set of achievable counts for the subtree of u.

          This becomes complex.

        Insight from known problems: This is similar to the problem "Tree Matching" and "Tree Permutation" problems.

        Known similar problem: "Workout" in codeforces? 

        Actually, we can use the following known solution:

          Step 1: Compute the set of achievable K? But note: N up to 500,000, so we cannot do a DP that is O(n^2).

        Alternatively, we can compute the minimum and maximum achievable working employees for the entire tree? And then see if K is in between?

          min_total: the minimum total working employees we can achieve for the entire tree.
          max_total: the maximum total working employees we can achieve for the entire tree.

          We know max_total = N (by top-down order).

          How to compute min_total?

            We can do:

               min_u = 0? But note: we cannot avoid having the leaves work? Actually, no: when a leaf arrives, it sees no subordinate -> condition holds -> works. So the leaf must work? Then the minimum for a leaf is 1.

            Actually, wait: the condition for a leaf: when it arrives, it has no subordinate? Then the number of working subordinates present is 0. Since 0<=A_leaf (which is at least 0) -> it works. So leaves are forced to work.

            Then for a node u: 
                 Let the children be v1, v2, ..., vm.

                 We can arrange the subtree of u arbitrarily. We have two ways:

                   Option 1: put u first -> then u works, and then we arrange the children arbitrarily to achieve the minimum for each child? Then min_u = 1 + sum_{v} min_v.

                   Option 2: put u not first -> then the condition for u: we can control the count that u sees? Specifically, we can avoid having u work? How? By making sure that when u arrives, there are more than A[u] working subordinates? Then u doesn't work. Then the total working employees in the subtree of u is the total working employees in the children subtrees? But we can also arrange the children to have as many working employees as possible? Actually, we are trying to minimize the total.

                 However, note: if we put u not first, then we are going to have at least the working employees that are in the children subtrees. And we know that the children subtrees have at least min_v each. But we can also choose to have the children subtrees achieve their minimum? Then the total working employees in the children subtrees is sum min_v. Then if we put u after all the children, then u sees the entire working employees in the children subtrees: sum min_v. Then if sum min_v <= A[u], then u works -> total = sum min_v + 1; else, u doesn't work -> total = sum min_v.

                 But what if we put u in the middle? Then we can avoid having u work by showing it more than A[u] working subordinates? How? We can include more than A[u] working employees from the children subtrees? But note: the total working employees from the children subtrees is fixed to at least sum min_v? Actually, no: we can choose the arrangement to include a subset of the working employees from the children subtrees? Actually, no: the working employees in a child subtree are fixed? Or can we choose the arrangement to achieve any value between min_v and max_v for each child subtree? 

            Actually, we don't know if the set of achievable working counts for a subtree is contiguous? 

        Known fact: the achievable working counts for a subtree u is an interval [min_u, max_u]? 

        We assume that for each child v, we can achieve any integer value between min_v and max_v for the working employees in the subtree of v? Then we can use:

            For the entire subtree of u, we can achieve:

              min_u = min(1 + sum_{v} min_v, ... )? 

            Actually, we can do:

              Option A: if we put u first, then we get total = 1 + sum_{v} x_v, where x_v in [min_v, max_v]. Then we can choose x_v arbitrarily? Then we can get any value from 1 + sum min_v to 1 + sum max_v.

              Option B: if we put u last, then we get total = (sum_{v} x_v) + (1 if (sum_{v} x_v) <= A[u] else 0). And we can choose x_v arbitrarily? Then the total becomes either T or T+1, where T = sum x_v, and T is in [sum min_v, sum max_v]. Then we can get:

                    If T <= A[u]: then we get T+1, which is in [min_sum+1, min(max_sum, A[u])+1]? 
                    If T > A[u]: then we get T, which is in [max(?, A[u]+1), max_sum]? 

              But note: we are free to choose T arbitrarily in [sum min_v, sum max_v]. So:

                    Let T be the total working employees in the children subtrees.

                    Then the total for the entire subtree u is:
                         if T <= A[u]: then we get T+1
                         if T > A[u]: then we get T

                    Then the set of values we can get is:
                         S1 = { T+1 for T in [sum min_v, min(max_sum, A[u])] }   -> integers from (sum min_v+1) to (min(max_sum, A[u])+1)
                         S2 = { T for T in [max(sum min_v, A[u]+1), sum max_v] }   -> integers from max(A[u]+1, sum min_v) to sum max_v.

              Then the entire set for the subtree u would be the union of S1 and the interval from Option A? Actually, we also have Option A: putting u first? Then we get the interval [1+sum min_v, 1+sum max_v]. So the entire set is:

                    [1+sum min_v, 1+sum max_v] ∪ [sum min_v+1, min(max_sum, A[u])+1] ∪ [max(A[u]+1, sum min_v), sum max_v]

              Actually, note that when we put u last, we can also choose T arbitrarily? But we also have the option to put u not first and not last? Actually, we can control the count that u sees arbitrarily? 

          Actually, we can do better: we can put u at any position and we can interleave the children subtrees arbitrarily. Then the working employees that u sees is exactly the working employees that we choose to put before u from the children subtrees. And we can choose the working employees arbitrarily from the entire set? Actually, we cannot change the working status of a node arbitrarily? But we can choose which nodes to put before u? However, the working status is determined by the condition at the time the node arrives? So we cannot arbitrarily set a node to work and then put it before u? 

          Alternatively, we can use a knapSack-like DP: 

            Let F(u) be the set of achievable working counts for the entire subtree u.

            How to compute F(u):

               Let F(u) = set()

               Option 1: put u first.
                 Then the entire subtree of u: the working count is 1 + T, where T is the total working employees in the children subtrees. And we can choose T arbitrarily as the sum of values chosen from the sets F(v) for the children? Actually, no: we are not free to choose the working counts arbitrarily per child? We have to assign an arrangement for the entire subtree, so the working counts for the children subtrees are independent? Then T can be any integer that is the sum of x_v, where x_v in F(v)? But note: the sets F(v) are intervals? Then the sum of intervals is not necessarily an interval? But if we assume each F(v) is an interval, then the sum is an interval? Actually, the sum of intervals [a1, b1], [a2, b2], ... is [sum a_i, sum b_i]? Yes, by the intermediate value theorem? 

               So if we put u first, then we get the interval [1 + sum min_v, 1 + sum max_v].

               Option 2: put u not first.

                 Then we can choose an integer X, which is the total working employees that we put before u from the entire subtree (excluding u). And note: the condition for u: if X <= A[u] then u works, else u doesn't.

                 Then the total working employees in the subtree of u is: 
                     (X) + (the working employees that come after u) + (1 if u works else 0)

                 But note: the working employees that come after u: they are the remaining working employees in the children subtrees? Actually, the entire working employees in the children subtrees is T. Then the working employees that are placed after u are T - (the working employees placed before u). However, we cannot arbitrarily assign which working employees are placed before u? Because the working status of a node is fixed by the condition? 

                 Actually, we cannot arbitrarily assign the working employees to be before or after u? The condition for a node in the subtree: if we put it before u, then its working status is determined independently? But note: the working status of a node in the subtree does not depend on u? So the working status of a node is fixed regardless of when u is placed? Then we can assign the working employees arbitrarily to be before or after u? 

                 Then the total working employees in the subtree of u is: 
                     T + (1 if X <= A[u] else 0)

                 And we can choose X arbitrarily between 0 and T? Then the condition for u becomes: 
                     if we choose X <= A[u] then total = T+1, 
                     if we choose X > A[u] then total = T.

                 But note: we can choose X arbitrarily? How? We can choose the arrangement arbitrarily: we can put any subset of the working employees before u? Then we can choose X to be any integer between 0 and T.

                 Therefore, we get:

                     if T >= A[u]+1, then we can choose X = A[u]+1 (which is <= T) and then u doesn't work -> total = T.
                     and we can also choose X = A[u] and then u works -> total = T+1.

                 Actually, we can get both T and T+1? 

                 Then if T >= A[u]+1, then we can get both T and T+1? Then the entire set for the subtree u in this option is {T, T+1}. But note: we can also get any T? Actually, we can get any value? 

                 Actually, we are not limited to T and T+1? We can get any value? 

                 But note: the total working employees in the subtree of u is either T or T+1? So we cannot get values other than T and T+1? 

                 However, we can also combine with Option 1: if we put u first, we get 1+T. And if we put u not first, we get either T or T+1. Then the entire set is {T, T+1, 1+T}? But note: T is the total working employees in the children subtrees, and T can be any value in the interval [sum min_v, sum max_v]. 

                 Therefore, the set F(u) would be:

                    F(u) = [1 + sum min_v, 1 + sum max_v]   (from Option 1) 
                            ∪ { T, T+1 for every T in [sum min_v, sum max_v] such that T>=A[u]+1 }   -> but note: for T>=A[u]+1, we get T and T+1? Actually, we get T and T+1 for every T in [max(sum min_v, A[u]+1), sum max_v]? 

                    And also, for T in [sum min_v, min(sum max_v, A[u])] we get T+1? (because we can choose X=T and then T<=A[u] -> u works -> total=T+1; and we can also choose X = any number? Actually, for T we can choose to put u at the beginning? Then we get 1+T? Or we can put u in the middle? But if we put u in the middle and choose X<=A[u], we also get T+1. So we don't get T for T<=A[u]? 

                 Actually, for T (the total working in children) we have:

                   If we put u not first, then:
                      if T <= A[u]: we can only get T+1 (by choosing any X<=A[u], and then u works) -> but note: we cannot get T? Because u works and the total becomes T+1.
                      if T > A[u]: we can choose to make u work or not? Actually, we can choose X to be <=A[u] then u works -> total=T+1, or choose X to be >A[u] then u doesn't work -> total=T.

                 So then:

                   Option 2: 
                      If we put u not first, then we can achieve:
                         for T in [0, A[u]]: we get T+1? But note: T is at least sum min_v. Actually, T is at least sum min_v and at most sum max_v.
                         for T in [A[u]+1, infinity] (within [sum min_v, sum max_v]): we get T and T+1.

                 However, we also have Option 1: putting u first gives 1+T for any T in [sum min_v, sum max_v].

                 Then the set F(u) is:

                   Option 1: {1+T for T in [sum min_v, sum max_v]} = [1+sum min_v, 1+sum max_v].

                   Option 2: 
                         { T+1 for T in [sum min_v, min(sum max_v, A[u])] } 
                         ∪ { T, T+1 for T in [max(sum min_v, A[u]+1), sum max_v] }

                 But note: in Option 2, we are not forced to choose a particular T? Actually, we are: T is the total working employees in the children subtrees, which we can choose arbitrarily in [sum min_v, sum max_v] by the independence? 

                 Therefore, we have:

                   F(u) = [1+sum min_v, 1+sum max_v] 
                           ∪ [sum min_v+1, min(sum max_v, A[u])+1] 
                           ∪ [max(sum min_v, A[u]+1), sum max_v] 
                           ∪ [max(sum min_v, A[u]+1)+1, sum max_v+1]   ??? 

                 Actually, the last part: { T, T+1 for T in [max(sum min_v, A[u]+1), sum max_v] } is the same as the interval [max(sum min_v, A[u]+1), sum max_v] and [max(sum min_v, A[u]+1)+1, sum max_v+1]. Then we can combine:

                   Let L = sum min_v, R = sum max_v.

                   Then:

                     Option 1: [1+L, 1+R]

                     Option 2: 
                         [L+1, min(R, A[u])+1] 
                         and two intervals: [max(L, A[u]+1), R] and [max(L, A[u]+1)+1, R+1]

                   Then F(u) = [L+1, R+1] ∪ [max(L, A[u]+1), R] 

                   But note: [L+1, R+1] already covers [L+1, min(R, A[u])+1] and [max(L, A[u]+1)+1, R+1]. So the only additional interval is [max(L, A[u]+1), R]? 

                   Also, note: [max(L, A[u]+1), R] might overlap with [L+1, R+1]? 

                   Actually, the entire set F(u) is:

                         [min(L+1, max(L, A[u]+1)), ... ] 

                   Actually, it's easier to note that F(u) is an interval? 

                   Specifically, we can achieve:

                         The minimum value for the subtree u: 
                             Option 2: if we put u last and choose T to be as small as possible (L) and then if L<=A[u] then total = L+1; if L>=A[u]+1 then total = L? But we can also put u first and get 1+L? Then the minimum is min(1+L, L+1 if L<=A[u], L if L>=A[u]+1) -> actually the minimum is min(1+L, L) if L>=A[u]+1? -> no: 1+L is always greater than L.

                         So the minimum is: 
                             if we can avoid making u work? then we can get L? But only if L>=A[u]+1? Then the minimum is min(1+L, L) = L? But if L>=A[u]+1, we can get L? Then the minimum is L? 
                             if L<=A[u], then we cannot get below L+1? 

                         Therefore: min_u = min(1+L, ...) 
                                   = min(1+L, L) if L>=A[u]+1 -> then min_u = L.
                                   = 1+L if L<=A[u].

                         But note: if L>=A[u]+1, we can get L? Then min_u = min(L, 1+L) = L.

                         Actually, 1+L is always >= L. So min_u = 
                             if L>=A[u]+1: then min_u = L
                             if L<=A[u]: then min_u = L+1   -> but wait, can we get L+1? Yes, but can we get lower? 
                                 We have: Option 2: we get T+1 for T>=L, so T+1>=L+1. And Option 1: we get 1+T>=1+L. So the minimum is L+1.

                         However, wait: if we put u not first and then choose to make u work? Then we get T+1. And T can be L? Then we get L+1. But we cannot get L? 

                         So min_u = 
                            if L>=A[u]+1: then we can get L (by putting u last and then u doesn't work, and the children achieve L) -> min_u = L.
                            if L<=A[u]: then the minimum we can get is L+1.

                         How about if L is in [A[u]+1, ...]? then min_u = L.
                         And if L<=A[u], then min_u = L+1.

                   Similarly, the maximum:

                         Option 1: 1+R
                         Option 2: for T=R, we can get R (if R>=A[u]+1) or R+1? Actually, if R<=A[u], then we get R+1. If R>=A[u]+1, we can get R+1? (by making u work) and R (by making u not work). So the maximum is max(1+R, R+1)=R+1? 

                         Therefore, max_u = R+1? 

                   Then the entire set F(u) is the interval [min_u, max_u]? 

                   Actually, we have:

                         min_u = 
                             if L >= A[u]+1: min_u = L
                             else: min_u = L+1

                         max_u = R+1

                   And we claim that every integer between min_u and max_u is achievable.

                   Why? 
                         If L>=A[u]+1: then min_u = L, and max_u = R+1.
                         We can achieve:
                            Option 2: we can achieve any T in [L, R] (by having the children achieve T and then putting u last and making u not work) -> so we get T.
                            Also, we can achieve T+1 for T in [L, R] (by making u work: either by putting u first or by putting u not first and then showing at most A[u] working employees? Actually, we can always show at most A[u] working employees if we want to make u work? How? 
                                  If T<=A[u]: we can show all T working employees and then u works -> total=T+1.
                                  If T>=A[u]+1: we can show only A[u] working employees? But note: we cannot hide the working status? We have to put the working employees arbitrarily? Actually, we can put a subset of the working employees before u? Then we can choose to show exactly A[u] working employees? Then u works -> total = T+1.

                         Therefore, we can achieve T for T in [L, R] and T+1 for T in [L, R]. Then the entire set is [L, R] ∪ [L+1, R+1] = [L, R+1]. 

                         But note: we also have Option 1: which gives [1+L, 1+R]? But since L>=A[u]+1, then 1+L>=L+1? So [1+L, 1+R] is a subset of [L, R+1]? Actually, [L, R+1] is contiguous from L to R+1? So then F(u)=[L, R+1].

                         And min_u = L, max_u = R+1.

                         So then F(u)=[min_u, max_u] is contiguous.

                         If L<=A[u]:
                            min_u = L+1, max_u = R+1.
                            We can achieve: 
                                 Option 1: [1+L, 1+R] = [L+1, R+1]? Actually, L+1 to R+1? 
                                 Option 2: for T in [L, min(R, A[u])] we get T+1 (which is in [L+1, min(R, A[u])+1]), and for T in [max(L, A[u]+1), R] we get T and T+1? But note: L<=A[u] so max(L, A[u]+1)=A[u]+1? Then we get [A[u]+1, R] and [A[u]+2, R+1]. 
                                 Then the entire set is [L+1, R+1]? Because:
                                     [L+1, min(R, A[u])+1] ∪ [A[u]+1, R] ∪ [A[u]+2, R+1] ∪ [L+1, R+1] (from Option1) = [L+1, R+1]? 
                                 Actually, the only gap might be from min(R, A[u])+1 to A[u]+1? 
                                     If min(R, A[u]) = R and R<=A[u], then we have [L+1, R+1] and that's contiguous? 
                                     If R>A[u], then min(R, A[u]) = A[u], so we have [L+1, A[u]+1] and [A[u]+1, R] and [A[u]+2, R+1]. Then the entire set is [L+1, R+1]? 

                         Therefore, in both cases, the set F(u) is the contiguous interval [min_u, max_u] where:
                            min_u = 
                                if L >= A[u]+1: min_u = L
                                else: min_u = L+1
                            max_u = R+1

            Then we can compute:

                Let u be a node.
                Let L = sum_{v in children} min_v   [but note: min_v is the minimum for the subtree of v? Actually, we defined min_v as the minimum achievable for the entire subtree of v?]

                Let R = sum_{v in children} max_v   [similarly]

                Then:
                  min_u = (L >= A[u]+1) ? L : L+1;
                  max_u = R+1;

            But note: the children are independent? Then the total working employees in the children subtrees is the sum of the working employees per child? And the sets for the children are contiguous? Then the sum of the min and max for the children is the min and max of the sum? 

            Then we can compute for the entire tree:

                min_1 and max_1: and then we require that K is in [min_1, max_1]? 

            Then we output a permutation if K is in [min_1, max_1], else -1.

        How to reconstruct the permutation?

          We know that for the entire tree, we want to achieve K working employees.

          We do a DFS to compute the min and max for each subtree? Then we know the achievable interval for the root.

          Then we traverse the tree and assign an order.

          We need to decide:

             For a node u, we know the total working employees we want to achieve for the entire subtree: let this be k (which is in [min_u, max_u]).

          How to achieve k?

            We know:

               min_u = (if L>=A[u]+1) then L else L+1
               max_u = R+1

            And the children: we have computed for each child v: min_v, max_v.

            Let T = total working employees in the children subtrees that we are going to achieve? We can choose T arbitrarily in [L, R]? Actually, we have to assign k for the entire subtree of u.

            We have two strategies:

              Strategy 1: put u first -> then the total = 1 + T, and we require 1+T = k -> then T = k-1. And we must have T in [L, R]? Then we can do it.

              Strategy 2: put u not first -> then the total = T + (1 if we make u work, 0 otherwise). And we have:

                    Case 2a: if we make u work -> then total = T+1 = k -> then T = k-1. And we must be able to achieve T in the children? and also we must have T<=A[u] (because we made u work).

                    Case 2b: if we make u not work -> then total = T = k. And we must have T>=A[u]+1.

            So:

              Option 1: if k = 1 + T for some T in [L, R] -> then we can put u first, and then we assign the children to achieve T.

              Option 2a: if k = T+1 and T in [L, min(R, A[u])] -> then we can put u not first and make u work by showing at most A[u] working employees? Actually, we can show exactly T working employees? Then u sees T working employees? Then if T<=A[u], u works -> then total = T+1 = k. And we assign the children to achieve T.

              Option 2b: if k = T and T in [max(L, A[u]+1), R] -> then we put u not first and make u not work by showing more than A[u] working employees? Specifically, we can show any number greater than A[u]? Actually, we can choose to show one working employee? But we cannot change the working status? Actually, we can choose to show at least A[u]+1 working employees? Then we show at least A[u]+1 working employees? But note: we have T working employees in the children. If T>=A[u]+1, we can choose to show at least A[u]+1 working employees? Actually, we can show all T working employees? Then u sees T working employees, which is >=A[u]+1 -> u doesn't work -> total = T = k.

            But note: we can also interleave arbitrarily? So we can achieve any T in [L, R]? 

            However, we have to assign the children to achieve T = sum of working employees in the children subtrees? And we can choose the working count per child arbitrarily in [min_v, max_v]? 

            How to assign the children subtrees to achieve a total T? 

              This is a knapSack? But note: the sets for the children are contiguous? Then the sum of contiguous intervals is contiguous? And we can achieve any T in [L, R]? 

            Therefore, we can do:

              If k is in the range:

                 Option 1: k-1 is in [L, R] -> then we choose T = k-1, and we use Strategy 1: put u first.

                 Option 2a: k-1 is in [L, min(R, A[u])] -> then we choose T = k-1, and we use Strategy 2: put u not first but we make u work.

                 Option 2b: k is in [max(L, A[u]+1), R] -> then we choose T = k, and we use Strategy 2: put u not first and we make u not work.

              But note: what if k is in more than one? Then we can choose arbitrarily.

            However, note: the entire set is contiguous? So k must be in [min_u, max_u]. 

            Steps for u:

               Let L = sum_{v} min_v, R = sum_{v} max_v.

               Then:

                 if (k == L && L>=A[u]+1) -> then we can use Option 2b: T = k = L, and we make u not work.

                 else if (k == L+1) -> then we can use:
                         if L>=A[u]+1: then we can use Option 2a? but then T=k-1 = L, and we require T<=A[u]? but L>=A[u]+1 -> fails. 
                         so then we must use Option 1? then T = k-1 = L, which is in [L,R] -> valid? 
                         or Option 2a? only if L<=A[u]? 

                 Actually, we have:

                   Option 1: k-1 in [L, R] -> then T = k-1 -> then we can do it if k-1>=L and k-1<=R.

                   Option 2a: k-1 in [L, min(R, A[u])] -> then T = k-1.

                   Option 2b: k in [max(L, A[u]+1), R] -> then T = k.

               Therefore, we check:

                 if (k-1 >= L && k-1 <= R) -> then we can use Option 1 or Option 2a? But we must also check the condition for Option 1: we put u first? then we don't care about A[u]? Actually, Option 1 always works? Then we can choose Option 1.

                 But what if we want to use Option 2? Because we want to reconstruct the permutation? 

               However, we have freedom. Let's choose:

                 We try:

                   Option 1: put u first -> then we must achieve T = k-1 in the children.

                   Then we need to combine the permutations of the children to achieve a total of T working employees? And we can choose the order arbitrarily? 

                   How to combine the children? We need to assign the working count for each child: let x_v in [min_v, max_v] such that sum x_v = T.

                   And we can do that because T is in [L, R] and the sets for the children are contiguous? Then we can use a greedy: 

                         For each child, we assign a value x_v in [min_v, max_v] such that the sum is T.

                         How? 

                           We start by assigning min_v to every child. Then we have T0 = L.

                           Then we need to add T - L more.

                           Then for each child, we can increase x_v by up to (max_v - min_v).

                           Then we do:

                                rem = T - L
                                For each child v (in any order), we assign:
                                    add = min(rem, max_v - min_v)
                                    x_v = min_v + add
                                    rem -= add

                   Then we know the working count for each child subtree.

                   Then we form the permutation for the subtree of u:

                         Start with u.

                         Then we combine the permutations for the children subtrees: for each child v, we have a permutation for its subtree that achieves x_v working employees. We can arrange the children subtrees arbitrarily? So we concatenate the permutations of the children subtrees in any order? 

                   But note: the condition for the children: the working status of a node does not depend on the other subtrees? So we can interleave? Actually, we cannot interleave arbitrarily? Because we have to put u first? Then the entire subtree permutation: we put u first, then we have to put the entire subtree of the children? And we can arrange the children subtrees arbitrarily? Then we can do:

                         permutation = [u] 
                         then append the permutation for child1, then child2, ... 

                   But we could also interleave? The problem: if we interleave, then the condition for a node in a child subtree might be affected? Actually, no: because the subordinates of a node are contained in its own subtree. So we can interleave arbitrarily the nodes from different children subtrees? 

                   However, to simplify, we can do:

                         We output u first, then we output the entire permutation of the children subtrees in an arbitrary order? Actually, we can output the children subtrees concatenated? 

                   But note: the problem says "if there are multiple solutions, output any".

                 Option 2: we put u not first.

                   We have two cases: 

                     Case 2a: we want u to work -> then k = T+1 -> T = k-1, and we require k-1 <= A[u] and k-1 in [L, R]? Actually, we require k-1 in [L, min(R, A[u])]? 

                     Then we assign the children to achieve T = k-1.

                     Then we need to form a permutation such that when u arrives, the number of working employees that u sees is at most A[u]. But we know T = k-1 <= A[u]. How can we control the number of working employees that u sees? 

                         We want to show u a number X <= A[u]. But we know the entire working employees in the children is T. And we can choose to show any subset of the working employees? Actually, we can choose any X between 0 and T. Since T<=A[u], we can choose X = T? Then u sees T working employees -> works -> total = T+1 = k.

                         How to show exactly T working employees? We put all the working employees before u? 

                         But note: the working employees are distributed arbitrarily in the children subtrees? And we can interleave arbitrarily? Then we can put all the nodes from the children subtrees before u? Then when u arrives, all the working employees in the children are already present? Then u sees T? 

                         Then permutation: 
                             [permutation of the entire children subtrees] then u.

                     However, we can also put u in the middle? But we want to show u all the working employees? Then we must put all the working employees before u. How do we do that? 

                         We have to output the entire subtree of the children? And then u.

                     But note: we can also have non-working employees? They are present? But the condition for u only counts the working employees. So we can put the non-working employees after u? 

                         Actually, no: the permutation must be a permutation of the entire subtree. 

                     How to form the permutation:

                         We have to put all the working employees before u? 

                         But the working employees are in the children subtrees? And we know the permutation for each child subtree? Then we can output the permutation of the children subtrees in any order? But note: we must not break the condition for the nodes in the children? 

                     Actually, we can form the permutation for the entire children subtrees arbitrarily? Then we can put the entire children subtrees (in any permutation that achieves the working counts) and then u.

                     Then when u arrives, it sees the entire children subtrees? Then the working employees it sees is T? 

                     Therefore, we do:

                         For each child v, we get a permutation for its subtree that achieves x_v working employees.

                         Then we combine the permutations of the children arbitrarily (say, we concatenate them in any order) and then put u at the end.

                     Then condition for u: sees T working employees -> works.

                     Total working = T+1 = k.

                     But note: what if we want to put u not at the end? We can put u at any position after all the working employees? Actually, we can put u immediately after the last working employee? But we don't know the positions? 

                     Actually, we can do: 
                         We are going to output the entire children subtrees, and then u. Then all working employees are before u.

                     But note: there might be non-working employees in the children subtrees? And we put them arbitrarily? Actually, we have fixed the permutation for each child subtree? Then we can output the concatenation.

                     However, we could also interleave? But the condition for a node in a child subtree does not depend on the other children? So we can interleave arbitrarily? 

                     Therefore, we can output the entire children subtrees in any order we want? Then we output u.

                 Case 2b: we want u not to work -> then k = T, and we require T>=A[u]+1 and T in [max(L, A[u]+1), R]? 

                     Then we assign the children to achieve T.

                     How to arrange: we need to show u more than A[u] working employees? We can show at least A[u]+1 working employees? But we have T working employees? Then we can show all T working employees? 

                     How? We put the entire children subtrees before u? Then u sees T working employees -> which is >=A[u]+1 -> doesn't work.

                     Then permutation: entire children subtrees (in any order) and then u.

          Therefore, we have:

            For node u, we want to achieve k working employees.

            Steps:

              Let L = sum min_v, R = sum max_v.

              if (k == 0) -> not possible? but k>=min_u, and min_u>=1? Actually, the root: if the root has min_1=0? But note: the root has no superior? And A_1>=0? Then the root will work? So min_1>=1? Actually, we computed min_u for u=1: 
                  L = sum_{children of root} min_v, then min_1 = (if L>=A_1+1)? L : L+1.

              How to reconstruct:

                 We consider:

                   Option 1: if k-1 is in [L, R] -> then we choose T = k-1, and we put u first.

                   Option 2a: if k-1 is in [L, min(R, A[u])] -> then we choose T = k-1, and we put u last (and u works).

                   Option 2b: if k is in [max(L, A[u]+1), R] -> then we choose T = k, and we put u last (and u does not work).

              But note: k might be in Option 1 and also in Option 2? Then we can choose any.

              Algorithm for u:

                 Let children = list of children.

                 Compute L = sum min_v, R = sum max_v.

                 Then:

                    if (k-1 >= L && k-1 <= R) {
                         T = k-1;
                         // Option 1: put u first.
                         permutation = [u];
                         Then we need to assign the children to achieve total working T.

                         How? We assign to each child v a value x_v in [min_v, max_v] such that sum x_v = T.

                         Then for each child v, we recursively build the permutation for the subtree of v that achieves x_v working employees.

                         Then we combine the permutations of the children arbitrarily? We can concatenate them? 

                         permutation = [u] + (concatenation of the permutations of the children in any order)

                    } else if (k-1 >= L && k-1 <= min(R, A[u])) {
                         T = k-1;
                         // Option 2a: put u last and u works.
                         Then we assign the children to achieve T.

                         Then permutation = (concatenation of the permutations of the children) + [u]

                    } else if (k >= max(L, A[u]+1) && k <= R) {
                         T = k;
                         // Option 2b: put u last and u does not work.
                         Then permutation = (concatenation of the permutations of the children) + [u]
                    } else {
                         // This should not happen because k is in [min_u, max_u]?
                         // But we have min_u and max_u, so k must be in one of these?
                         // Actually, we have min_u = (L>=A[u]+1)? L : L+1, and max_u = R+1.
                         // And we have covered:
                         //   if k-1 in [L, R] -> Option1
                         //   if k-1 in [L, min(R, A[u])] -> Option2a
                         //   if k in [max(L, A[u]+1), R] -> Option2b
                         // But note: if k = min_u and min_u = L (which happens when L>=A[u]+1) then we use Option2b? 
                         //   because k = L is in [max(L, A[u]+1), R]? Actually, if L>=A[u]+1, then max(L, A[u]+1)=L, so k=L is in [L, R]? Then we use Option2b.

                         // Similarly, if k = min_u = L+1 (when L<=A[u]), then we can use Option1 (if L+1-1 = L is in [L,R] -> yes) or Option2a (if L+1-1=L is in [L, min(R, A[u])] -> yes).

                         // So we should have covered.

                         // But what if k = min_u = L+1 and also L>R? that cannot happen.

                         // Actually, we must have L<=R.

                         // Therefore, we should always have a branch.

                         // If we get here, we output an error.

                    }

          However, note: the condition for Option1: k-1 in [L,R] is independent of A[u]. And the condition for Option2a and Option2b depend on A[u]. And we have:

            min_u = (L>=A[u]+1) ? L : L+1

            So if k = min_u = L (when L>=A[u]+1), then we use Option2b? Then k must be in [max(L, A[u]+1), R]? 
                max(L, A[u]+1) = L, and k = L, so [L, R] is the interval -> so k is in [L, R]? Then we use Option2b.

            Similarly, if k = min_u = L+1 (when L<=A[u]), then we can use either Option1 (if k-1 = L is in [L,R]) or Option2a (if k-1 = L is in [L, min(R, A[u])])? 
                Since L<=A[u] and L<=R, then L is in [L, min(R, A[u])]? So we can use Option2a.

            Therefore, we can also do:

                 if (k-1 >= L && k-1 <= R) and (we choose to use Option1) -> then we do Option1.

                 else if (k-1 >= L && k-1 <= min(R, A[u])) -> then Option2a.

                 else if (k >= max(L, A[u]+1) && k <= R) -> then Option2b.

            But note: k might be covered by more than one? Then we can choose arbitrarily.

          How to assign the working counts to the children? 

            We have T = either k-1 (for Option1 and Option2a) or k (for Option2b).

            Then we need to assign to each child v a value x_v in [min_v, max_v] such that sum x_v = T.

            We do:

                Initialize an array x for children: set x_v = min_v for each child.

                Then rem = T - L.

                Then iterate over the children arbitrarily (we can use any order) and for each child:

                    add = min(rem, max_v - min_v)
                    x_v = min_v + add
                    rem -= add

            Then if rem>0, it would fail? But we know T in [L, R]? Then rem should become 0.

          Then for each child v, we recursively build the permutation for the subtree of v that achieves x_v working employees.

          Then we combine:

            For Option1: permutation = [u] + (the concatenation of the permutations for the children in any order? or interleaved arbitrarily? Actually, we can just concatenate.)

            For Option2a and Option2b: permutation = (the concatenation of the permutations for the children) + [u]

          But note: we can interleave the children arbitrarily? Then we can output the children in any order? 

          However, the problem: when we do Option2a, we require that u sees at most A[u] working employees? Actually, we have arranged to put u last, so it sees all T working employees? And we know T<=A[u] for Option2a? So it works.

          But what if we don't put u last? We can put u anywhere after all the working employees? How? 

             We have to make sure that by the time u arrives, the working employees that have arrived are at least the ones we want to show? Actually, we want to show at least A[u]+1 for Option2b? And for Option2a, we are showing T (which is <=A[u]). But we are showing all the working employees? 

          However, we can also choose to show a subset? Actually, in our reconstruction we are putting u at the end? Then it sees all the working employees? 

          But note: we have the freedom to interleave arbitrarily? Then we could also put u earlier? But then we would see only a part of the working employees? 

          For Option2a: we want u to work. We need to show at most A[u] working employees. We have T working employees? And T<=A[u]. How to show at most A[u]? We can show all of them? Then we have T<=A[u], so it's okay. But we could also show less? Then we would not use all the working employees? But we have T working employees? Then we must show at least T working employees? Actually, we must show all of them? Because we cannot hide a working employee? 

          Actually, the condition: when u arrives, the working employees that are present and are its subordinates. We have to have the entire subtree of u arranged arbitrarily? Then we can choose to put some working employees after u? Then they are not present? Then u doesn't see them? 

          Therefore, we can control the count X that u sees arbitrarily from 0 to T? 

          Then for Option2a: we don't need to put u last? We can put u at any position as long as we have put at most A[u] working employees before u? Then we can choose X to be any number between 0 and T? Then we can choose X to be T? Then we can put u after all the working employees? 

          Similarly, for Option2b: we need to show at least A[u]+1 working employees? Then we can put u after at least A[u]+1 working employees? But we can choose to show exactly A[u]+1? Then we don't have to show all? 

          How to do that?

            We need to assign the working employees arbitrarily to the positions? Then we can do:

               For Option2a: we want to show u at most A[u] working employees? Actually, we want to show u at most A[u]? But we know T<=A[u]. Then we can show u all T? Then we put u after all the working employees? 

               But we can also show u less? Then we could put u earlier? 

            However, we don't care? Because the condition for u: if we show u at most A[u] working employees, then u works. Then we can show u all T? 

            Similarly, for Option2b: we can show u at least A[u]+1 working employees? Then we can show u exactly A[u]+1? How?

               We have T working employees? And T>=A[u]+1. Then we can choose any X in [A[u]+1, T] to show to u? 

               How to arrange: we put u after exactly X working employees? And we choose X = A[u]+1? 

               Then we put the first X working employees, then u, then the remaining T - X working employees? 

               But note: when we put u, we have not put all the working employees? Then the remaining working employees are not present? Then u only sees the X working employees? 

               Then we can do:

                  We break the working employees into two groups: 
                      Group1: X = A[u]+1 working employees to show to u.
                      Group2: the remaining T - (A[u]+1) working employees.

                  And we can also have non-working employees? They can be anywhere? 

               How to form the permutation:

                  We can put:

                     [some permutation that includes Group1 and possibly non-working employees?] then u, then the rest.

               But we have to form the entire subtree? And we have the children subtrees? 

            This becomes complex.

          Alternatively, we can avoid interleaving? We can output:

            For Option1: u first, then the children subtrees concatenated arbitrarily.

            For Option2a: we output the entire children subtrees (with the working counts) and then u. Then u sees T? which is <=A[u] -> works.

            For Option2b: we output the entire children subtrees and then u. Then u sees T? which is >=A[u]+1 -> doesn't work.

          But is that always valid? 

            The condition for a node in a child subtree: when it arrives, it only sees its own subtree? So the arrangement of other children subtrees (which are not in its subtree) does not matter? Then we can output the children subtrees in any order? 

          Therefore, we can output:

            For Option1: [u] + (concatenation of the permutations for the children)

            For Option2a and Option2b: (concatenation of the permutations for the children) + [u]

          Then we are done.

        Steps:

          Precomputation:

            Build the tree: 
                 children[u] = list of children.

            Then do a DFS to compute min_u and max_u for each node:

                 L = 0, R = 0
                 for each child v of u:
                     L += min_v
                     R += max_v

                 min_u = (L >= A[u]+1) ? L : L+1;
                 max_u = R+1;

          Then at the root, check if K is in [min_1, max_1]. If not, output -1.

          Then do a DFS for reconstruction:

            void dfs(u, k): 
               // We want the permutation for the subtree u that achieves k working employees.

               if u is a leaf:
                  // min_u: 
                  //   L=0 -> then min_u = (0>=A[u]+1)? 0 : 1 -> but A[u]>=0 -> 0>=1? false -> min_u=1.
                  //   and k must be 1.
                  output [u]

               Else:
                  Let L = 0, R = 0;
                  for each child v: 
                      L += min_v, R += max_v

                  vector<child> = children of u.

                  if (k-1 >= L && k-1 <= R) {
                      T = k-1;
                      // assign T to children: 
                      vector<int> assign_x;
                      for each child v:
                          assign_x[v] = min_v;
                      rem = T - L;
                      for each child v (in any order) and while rem>0:
                          add = min(rem, max_v - min_v);
                          assign_x[v] += add;
                          rem -= add;

                      // Then permutation for u: 
                      vector<int> res;
                      res.push_back(u);
                      for each child v:
                          vector<int> child_perm = dfs(v, assign_x[v]);
                          // append child_perm to res? 
                          // But we can output the children subtrees in any order? 
                          // Then we just append one after the other.
                          res.insert(res.end(), child_perm.begin(), child_perm.end());
                      return res;
                  } else if (k-1 >= L && k-1 <= min(R, A[u])) {
                      T = k-1;
                      // assign T to children
                      ... same as above ...

                      vector<int> res;
                      for each child v:
                          vector<int> child_perm = dfs(v, assign_x[v]);
                          res.insert(res.end(), child_perm.begin(), child_perm.end());
                      res.push_back(u);
                      return res;
                  } else if (k >= max(L, A[u]+1) && k <= R) {
                      T = k;
                      // assign T to children
                      ... same as above ...

                      vector<int> res;
                      for each child v:
                          vector<int> child_perm = dfs(v, assign_x[v]);
                          res.insert(res.end(), child_perm.begin(), child_perm.end());
                      res.push_back(u);
                      return res;
                  } else {
                      // This should not happen.
                      // But we throw an error?
                      // We can return an empty vector? 
                      // Actually, we know k is in [min_u, max_u], so we should have covered.
                      // But if not, we output an error.
                      throw;
                  }

          But note: the array A: we index from 0? The input: 
                A[0] = A_1, A[1] = A_2, ... 
            and the employees are 1-indexed.

          We store A for node u: we can store an array A[1..N] (using 1-indexing).

          The tree: we have parent for i from 2 to N: B_i.

          Steps:

            Read N, K.
            Read A[1..N] (index from 1)
            Read B[2..N] (so for i=2 to N: B_i)

            Build the tree: 
                vector<int> children[N+1];
                for i from 2 to N:
                    children[B_i].push_back(i);

            Then we do a DFS (postorder) to compute min_u and max_u for u from leaves to root.

            Then if K is not in [min_1, max_1] -> output -1.

            Then we do the reconstruction DFS starting at the root with k=K.

          However, note: the DFS for reconstruction might be heavy: we are storing the entire permutation? And the tree is large (500000 nodes). 

          How to avoid storing the entire permutation in memory during recursion? 

            We can use iterative DFS? But we are doing a DFS that returns a vector? Then we will have 500000 vectors? And each vector is the permutation of the subtree? Then the total memory is O(n^2) which is 250e9? 

          We need to avoid storing the entire permutation in memory? We need to output the entire permutation.

          Alternative: we can build the permutation by outputting as we go? But the reconstruction DFS is recursive and we need to combine the permutations of the children? 

          We can use an iterative method? Or we can use a BFS? 

          Actually, we can avoid storing the entire permutation by using a global array and writing the permutation as we go? 

          We design:

            We do a DFS that returns the size of the subtree? and we write the permutation to a global array? 

            But we need to know the entire permutation for the subtree? 

          Alternatively, we can do:

            We know the entire structure: we are going to output:

               For Option1: u first, then the children in arbitrary order.

               For Option2: the children in arbitrary order then u.

            How to do without storing the entire vectors?

            We can output u immediately for Option1? Then we output the children.

            For Option2: we output the children first, then u.

            But we are doing DFS recursively? Then we can:

                Option1:
                   output u (print u)
                   then for each child v: 
                         dfs(v, x_v)

                Option2a and Option2b:
                   for each child v:
                         dfs(v, x_v)
                   then output u

            Then we don't store the entire permutation, we output as we go.

          However, we must compute the assignment for the children? We need to know the x_v for each child? 

          Steps:

            We do a DFS (postorder) to compute min_u and max_u.

            Then we do a DFS (preorder) for reconstruction that outputs the permutation.

            In the reconstruction DFS:

                We are given u and k.

                We compute L = sum min_v, R = sum max_v.

                Then we decide the option and T.

                Then we assign the x_v for each child.

                Then:

                  if Option1:
                     print u
                     for each child v (in any order) do: dfs(v, x_v)

                  if Option2a or Option2b:
                     for each child v (in any order) do: dfs(v, x_v)
                     print u

            But note: the order of the children? We can do in any order? Then we can iterate over the children in the order they are stored? 

          However, we must compute the assignment x_v for the children? 

          Steps for assignment:

             We have the children in a list.

             We need to assign x_v for each child.

             We can do:

                 Initialize an array for the children: we store the min_v, max_v, and the index of the child.

                 Then sort the children? Actually, we don't care? We can assign in any order? 

                 Then:

                    rem = T - L   [where T is either k-1 or k]

                    for each child v (in the list):

                         add = min(rem, max_v - min_v)
                         x_v = min_v + add
                         rem -= add

          How to get the min_v and max_v for each child? We computed them in the first DFS? Then we can store:

             min_node[u] = min_u
             max_node[u] = max_u

          Then in the reconstruction for u, we can access for each child v: min_v = min_node[v], max_v = max_node[v].

          Then we assign x_v for each child.

          Then we do the DFS for the children.

          Memory: we only store the current u's children and the assignment for the children? Then O(degree(u)) per node? Total memory O(n).

          How about recursion depth? The tree can be a chain? Then recursion depth O(n). But n=500000 -> might cause stack overflow? 

          We can use iterative DFS? 

          Alternatively, we can do BFS? 

          We do:

            First DFS (postorder) to compute min and max: we can use iterative? or BFS from leaves to root? 

            We can do:

               queue: all leaves.

               Then process from leaves to root? 

            Similarly, the reconstruction DFS: we can do iterative? 

          But the problem: the reconstruction DFS is a DFS that we do from the root and then we traverse the children? We can do iterative DFS? 

          Alternatively, we can do:

            We store for each node: 
                parent, 
                and the list of children.

            Then we do a BFS (level order) from the root? But we need to compute the assignment for the children? 

          However, the reconstruction DFS must be done in a top-down manner? 

          We can do:

            Use a stack:

               stack: (node u, the value k for the subtree)

               Then we push the root.

               Then while stack not empty:

                  pop (u, k)

                  Then compute L, R from the children? But we need the min and max for the children? we have stored them.

                  Then assign T and the x_v for each child.

                  Then if Option1: output u, and then push the children? But in what order? 

                  Actually, we cannot output u until we output the entire children for Option2? 

          Alternatively, we can do iterative in the order of the DFS? 

          We do:

            We store the entire tree.

            We do a BFS for the reconstruction? 

          Actually, we can do:

            We know for each node u, we know the option we chose? Then we can store:

               type[u]: 
                   0 -> Option1: u first
                   1 -> Option2: u last

            Then we can do a BFS that collects the nodes:

               We want to output the permutation.

               We do:

                 if type[u] = 0: 
                    we output u now.
                    then we process the children (we push them to the stack? and then we will process them in DFS order? But we want to do iterative)

                 if type[u] = 1:
                    we output u after processing the entire subtree.

            This is similar to DFS? 

          To avoid recursion, we can use iterative DFS with a stack that stores:

                (u, k, state)

            state=0: we haven't processed u: then we assign the x_v for the children and then if Option1: we output u and then push the children. If Option2: we push the children and then we will output u at state=1.

          Steps for iterative DFS:

            stack.push( (root, K, 0) )

            while stack not empty:
               (u, k, state) = stack.pop()

               if state==0:

                  if u is leaf:
                     output u   // because for leaf, k must be 1 -> then Option1: we output u first? But we don't have children? Then we output u and done.

                  else:

                     Compute L, R from the children.

                     Then decide the option and T.

                     Then assign the x_v for the children.

                     Then:

                         if Option1: 
                             output u
                             then for each child v (in any order, say from first to last) push (v, x_v, 0)

                         if Option2a or Option2b:
                             // we will output the children first, then u at state=1.
                             // push a marker for u: (u, k, 1) 
                             // then push all children (in reverse order? so that the first child is processed last) so that we output in the order we want? 

                             Actually, we can push the children in reverse order? 

                             stack.push( (u, k, 1) )
                             for each child v in reverse order of the list:
                                 stack.push( (v, x_v, 0) )

               if state==1:
                     output u

          Then we output the permutation.

          But note: we must store the assignment for the children? We computed it at state=0? Then we need to store the x_v for the children? 

          We can store:

                For each node u, we store:
                   the option chosen (type)
                   the list of children and the assigned x_v for each child.

          Then we do:

                First DFS (iterative) to compute min and max.

                Then we store for each node u: min_u, max_u.

                Then we do an iterative DFS for reconstruction:

                    We need to store for each node u: 
                         the k for the subtree
                         the type (so we know what to do)
                         the list of children and the assigned x_v? 

                How? We can precompute the assignment for the children for every node? 

                Steps:

                    We do a BFS from the root? 

                    queue: start with root.

                    Then for each node u, we compute:

                         if u is leaf: skip.

                         else:

                            L = sum_{v in children} min_v
                            R = sum_{v in children} max_v

                            Then if (k_u - 1 >= L && k_u-1 <= R) {
                                type[u] = 0;
                                T = k_u - 1;
                            } else if (k_u-1 >= L && k_u-1 <= min(R, A[u])) {
                                type[u] = 1;   // Option2a: u last and works -> but we don't care about a vs b? we just know we output u last.
                                T = k_u - 1;
                            } else if (k_u >= max(L, A[u]+1) && k_u <= R) {
                                type[u] = 1;   // Option2b: u last and doesn't work -> we still output u last.
                                T = k_u;
                            }

                            Then assign x_v for each child: 
                                 rem = T - L
                                 for each child v (in arbitrary order) {
                                      add = min(rem, max_v - min_v)
                                      x_v = min_v + add
                                      rem -= add
                                      then set k_v = x_v   // the target for child v
                                 }

                    Then we push the children to the queue.

                Then we do a DFS (iterative) to output the permutation? 

                Actually, we can do:

                    We do a stack for output:

                    stack.push(root)

                    while stack not empty:

                         u = stack.pop()

                         if type[u]==0:
                             output u
                             for each child v of u (in any order) -> push v to stack? But we want to output the entire subtree of v? 

                         if type[u]==1:
                             for each child v of u (in reverse order) push v to stack
                             then push u again with a marker? 

                    But we need to know when to output u for type1? 

                Alternatively, we can do:

                    We do a DFS that outputs the permutation without storing the entire vector? 

                    We do:

                      stack of (u, state)  // state=0: haven't processed, state=1: already processed the children.

                    Then:

                      stack.push((root,0))

                      while stack not empty:

                         (u, state) = stack.pop()

                         if state==0:

                             if type[u]==0:
                                 output u
                                 for each child v (in reverse order) push (v,0)   // so that the first child is processed first? 

                                 Actually, if we push in reverse order, then the last child is popped first? Then we want the children to be output in the order we push? 

                                 But the problem: we can output the children in any order? Then we can push in reverse order? Then we pop the last child first? 

                             if type[u]==1:
                                 // we will output u after the children.

                                 // push u with state=1
                                 stack.push((u,1))

                                 // then push the children in reverse order? 
                                 for i = last child to first child:
                                     stack.push((child[i],0))

                         if state==1:
                             output u

                    But note: we must store the type of the node? We precomputed type[u] and the k_v for the children? 

          However, we don't need to store the k_v for the children in the output DFS? Because the assignment of k_v has been precomputed? And then for the children, we know the k_v? 

          Actually, we precomputed for every node u the target k_u? 

          Then we also precomputed the type for u? 

          Then we can do:

                Precomputation for min, max and assignment for the entire tree (BFS from root to leaves for assignment? or DFS? but we need the children to be processed first? so BFS from leaves to root?).

          Steps for the entire algorithm:

            Step 1: Input.

            Step 2: Build the tree.

            Step 3: 
                 Compute the topological order (from leaves to root). We can do a BFS from the root? Actually, we need a reverse topological order? 

                 Let order = BFS from the root? Then we process the nodes in reverse order (from last to first) -> so that when we process u, all children are processed.

            Step 4: 
                 For each node u in reverse BFS order (starting from leaves to root):

                    if u is leaf:
                         min_u = 1
                         max_u = 1
                    else:
                         L = 0, R = 0
                         for each child v:
                             L += min_v
                             R += max_v
                         min_u = (L>=A[u]+1) ? L : L+1
                         max_u = R+1

            Step 5: Check for root: if K is not in [min_1, max_1] -> output -1 and exit.

            Step 6: Precompute the assignment and the type for every node (from root to leaves) and the k_v for the children.

                 We do BFS from the root:

                    queue q;
                    q.push(1)   // root
                    k_1 = K

                    while q not empty:

                         u = q.front(); q.pop();

                         if u is leaf: 
                             // no child -> then we skip the assignment? 
                             continue;

                         L = 0, R = 0;
                         for each child v: 
                             L += min_v, R += max_v

                         if (k_u - 1 >= L && k_u-1 <= R) {
                              type[u] = 0;
                              T = k_u - 1;
                         } else if (k_u-1 >= L && k_u-1 <= min(R, A[u])) {
                              type[u] = 1;
                              T = k_u - 1;
                         } else if (k_u >= max(L, A[u]+1) && k_u <= R) {
                              type[u] = 1;
                              T = k_u;
                         }

                         // Now assign to children:

                         // We have the list of children. For each child, we have min_v, max_v.

                         // We want to assign x_v for each child such that sum x_v = T.

                         // We do:

                         vector< pair<int, int> > child_list; // for each child: (min_v, max_v, child_index)
                         for each child v of u:
                             child_list.push_back( (min_v, max_v, v) );

                         // We can assign in any order? Then we can sort by (max_v - min_v) descending to avoid having to store state? 
                         // Actually, we do:

                         sort child_list by (max_v - min_v) descending? 

                         Then rem = T - L;
                         for each child in child_list:
                             add = min(rem, max_v - min_v);
                             x_v = min_v + add;
                             rem -= add;
                             // set k_v for child = x_v
                             k[child_index] = x_v;
                             q.push(child_index);

            Step 7: Output the permutation by traversing the tree iteratively (with a stack) as described:

                    stack of (u, state)  // state: 0 for not processed, 1 for processed children.

                    stack.push( (1, 0) )   // root

                    while stack not empty:

                         (u, state) = stack.pop();

                         if state==0:

                             if type[u] == 0:
                                 // Option1: output u now.
                                 output u (print u)

                                 // then push the children in reverse order? so that the first child in the list is processed last? 
                                 // But we don't care the order of the children? Then we can push in reverse order? 
                                 for i = last child to first child in the list of children of u:
                                     stack.push( (child, 0) )

                             else:   // type[u] == 1: Option2
                                 // we will output u after the children.

                                 stack.push( (u, 1) )

                                 // push the children in reverse order? 
                                 for i = last child to first child in the list of children of u:
                                     stack.push( (child, 0) )

                         else: // state==1
                                 output u

          But note: the output: we are printing the permutation? Then we must print the numbers? 

          However, we are printing as we go? Then we output the permutation.

          But the problem: the entire output must be a permutation? 

          How about the leaves? 

            For a leaf u: 
                type[u] is not defined? because we did not assign? 

            In Step 6: we skip the leaf? Then in the output DFS, we do:

                if u is leaf: we don't have children? Then:

                  if type[u] is not defined? Then we do:

                     In Step 6, we did not push the leaf? Then in the output DFS, when we pop a leaf (state=0), then we output it? 

                Actually, in Step 6, we did not assign type for leaves? 

            How about we define for leaves:

                We know: for a leaf, we have only one option: 
                    k must be 1.

                Then we can set:

                    type[u] = 0? or 1? 

                But we don't have children? Then we can output immediately? 

                Actually, in the output DFS:

                    if u is leaf, then in state0:

                         if type[u] is 0: output u -> then no children -> done.

                         if type[u] is 1: then we push u with state1 and then push children? but there are none? then we pop u and output it? 

                So both would output u.

            So we can set type for leaves arbitrarily? Let's set type[leaf]=0.

            Then in Step 6: for a leaf, we skip? Then we don't set type? Then in the output DFS, we don't know the type? 

            We can set the type for leaves in Step 4? 

            In Step 4: we set min_u=1, max_u=1 for a leaf.

            Then in Step 6: we push the root. Then we push the children? Then we eventually push the leaves? 

            How? 

                In Step 6, we start from the root and then we push the children? Then we process the leaves? 

                For a leaf u: 
                    We try:

                       if (k_u-1 >= L && ...) -> but L=0, R=0? 
                       k_u must be 1.

                       Then k_u-1=0.

                       Then check: 
                           Option1: 0 in [0,0] -> true? Then we set type[u]=0, T=0? Then we assign to children: but there are none? Then we skip.

                Then we don't push any children for the leaf.

            Then in the output DFS: we push the leaf with state0? Then we output u (because type[u]=0) and then we push the children? none -> done.

          Therefore, we do:

            Step 6: for every node (including leaves) we do the assignment? 

            For a leaf: 
                children: none -> then L=0, R=0.
                k_u = 1.

                Then: 
                  if (1-1=0 in [0,0]) -> Option1: type[u]=0, T=0.

                Then we do the assignment: rem = T - L = 0, then no children -> done.

            Then we push the children? none.

          Then the output DFS for the leaf: 
                state0: type[u]=0 -> output u -> done.

          So it works.

          Note: the array A: we use A[u] for node u.

          But note: the input A is given for employee i: 
                The second line: A_1, A_2, ... A_N.

          We store for node i: A[i] = A_i.

          And the tree: node i has children stored in children[i].

        Let's test with a sample: Sample Input #1: 
            "5 3
             3 2 1 2 2 
             1 2 2 1"

          The tree: 
             node1: CEO, A1=3
             node2: parent=B2=1
             node3: parent=B3=2
             node4: parent=B4=2
             node5: parent=B5=1

          Then the edges:
             1->2, 1->5
             2->3, 2->4

          Leaves: 3,4,5.

          Step 4: compute min and max for leaves: min_leaf = 1, max_leaf=1.

          Then node2: 
                children: 3,4 -> L = min_3+min_4=1+1=2, R=1+1=2.
                min_2 = (2>=A[2]+1)? A[2]=2 -> 2>=3? false -> min_2=2+1=3.
                max_2 = 2+1=3.

          Then node5: leaf -> min_5=1, max_5=1.

          Then node1: 
                children: 2,5 -> L = min_2+min_5=3+1=4, R=3+1=4.
                min_1 = (4>=A[1]+1)? A[1]=3 -> 4>=4? true -> min_1=4.
                max_1=4+1=5.

          Then K=3: is 3 in [4,5]? no -> output -1.  -> matches sample.

          Sample Input #2: 
            "7 5
             4 2 0 0 3 0 1 
             1 2 1 2 2 3"

          The tree: 
             nodes: 1..7
             edges: 
                B2=1 -> 1->2
                B3=2 -> 2->3
                B4=1 -> 1->4
                B5=2 -> 2->5
                B6=2 -> 2->6
                B7=3 -> 3->7

          Then:

            Leaves: 4,5,6,7? 
                But node3 has child 7? so leaves: 4,5,6,7.

            Step 4: 
                min_4=1, max_4=1
                min_5=1, max_5=1
                min_6=1, max_6=1
                min_7=1, max_7=1

            Node3: 
                children: [7] -> L=1, R=1.
                min_3 = (1>=A[3]+1)? A[3]=0 -> 1>=1 -> true -> min_3=1.
                max_3=1+1=2.

            Node2: 
                children: 3,5,6 -> 
                    L = min_3+min_5+min_6 = 1+1+1=3
                    R = max_3+max_5+max_6 = 2+1+1=4
                min_2 = (3>=A[2]+1)? A[2]=2 -> 3>=3? true -> min_2=3.
                max_2=4+1=5.

            Node1: 
                children: 2,4 -> 
                    L = min_2+min_4 = 3+1=4
                    R = max_2+max_4 = 5+1=6
                min_1 = (4>=A[1]+1)? A[1]=4 -> 4>=5? false -> min_1=5.
                max_1=6+1=7.

            Then K=5: in [5,7] -> possible.

            Step 6: 
                Start with root (1): k1=5.

                For node1: 
                    Option1: k1-1=4 in [4,6] -> true -> type[1]=0, T=4.
                    Then assign to children: 
                         L=4, so rem=0.
                         Then x_2 = min_2=3, x_4=min_4=1? -> then k2=3, k4=1.

                Then push child2 and child4.

            Then for node2: 
                k2=3.
                L=3, R=4.
                Option1: k2-1=2 in [3,4]? false.
                Option2a: 2 in [3, min(4,2)]? min(4,2)=2 -> 2 in [3,2]? false.
                Option2b: k2=3 in [max(3, A[2]+1)=max(3,3)=3, 4] -> true -> type[2]=1, T=3.

                Then assign to children: 
                    L=3, rem=0.
                    Then x_3=min_3=1, x_5=min_5=1, x_6=min_6=1.

                Then push children 3,5,6.

            Then for node3: 
                k3=1.
                L=1 (for child7) -> but node3 has child7? 
                Then: 
                    Option1: k3-1=0 in [1,?] -> false.
                    Option2a: 0 in [1, min(1, A[3]=0)]? min(1,0)=0 -> 0 in [1,0] -> false.
                    Option2b: k3=1 in [max(1,1)=1, 1] -> true -> type[3]=1, T=1.

                Then assign: 
                    For child7: min_7=1, so rem = 1 - 1 = 0 -> x7=1.

            Then for node4: leaf -> type=0? 
            node5: leaf -> type=0?
            node6: leaf -> type=0?
            node7: leaf? -> but we already processed node3? 

            Then output DFS:

                Start: push (1,0)

                pop (1,0): type[1]=0 -> output 1, then push children in reverse order: [4,2] (since children of 1: [2,4] -> reverse: push 4 then push 2? Then stack: [4,2] (stack: top is 2? then 4? actually, we push 4 then 2, then pop: 2 then 4)

                Then pop (2,0): type[2]=1 -> push (2,1) then push children: children of 2: [3,5,6] -> push in reverse: 6,5,3.

                Then pop (3,0): type[3]=1 -> push (3,1) then push children: [7] -> push 7.

                Then pop (7,0): type[7]=0? -> but we didn't assign type for 7? 

            We did for node3: we set type[3]=1? Then for node7, we did:

                In step 6: we pushed node3, then we set type[3]=1, and we set k7=1? Then we pushed node7? 

                Then for node7: we do:

                   leaf: then we set type? In step6, we do for every node? Then for node7:

                         L=0, R=0.
                         k7=1.
                         Then: if (1-1=0 in [0,0]) -> true -> type[7]=0.

                Then in the output DFS for node7: type[7]=0 -> output 7.

                Then push children? none.

                Then pop (3,1): output 3.

                Then pop (5,0): type[5]=0 -> output 5.

                Then pop (6,0): type[6]=0 -> output 6.

                Then pop (2,1): output 2.

                Then pop (4,0): type[4]=0 -> output 4.

            Then the permutation: 1, 7, 3, 5, 6, 2, 4? 

            But the sample output: "7 3 6 5 2 1 4" -> different.

            But we can output any permutation? 

            Our permutation: 1,7,3,5,6,2,4.

            Let's check the working employees:

                Order: 1,7,3,5,6,2,4.

                Employee1: arrives first -> sees no subordinate? -> works.
                Employee7: when arrives, who are its subordinates? 
                    Employee7: in the tree, its only subordinate is itself? Actually, the subordinates of 7 are the nodes in the subtree of 7? Only 7? 
                    But 7 is not present? Then when 7 arrives, it sees no subordinate? -> works? 
                    But wait: the condition: the work tolerance of 7: A7=1? 
                    But it has no subordinate? Then 0<=1 -> works.
                Employee3: 
                    Subordinates: 7 (already present and working) -> count=1. 
                    A3=0 -> then 1<=0? false -> doesn't work.
                Employee5: 
                    Subordinates: none? -> works? 
                Employee6: 
                    Subordinates: none? -> works.
                Employee2:
                    Subordinates: 3,5,6,7? 
                    Already present: 3,5,6,7? 
                    Working: 7 (working), 5 (working), 6 (working), 3 (not working) -> so working subordinates: 3? (only the ones that are working and present) -> count=3? 
                    A2=2 -> 3<=2? false -> doesn't work.
                Employee4:
                    Subordinates: none? -> works.

                Then working: 1,7,5,6,4 -> 5 employees? But we want 5 -> it matches.

            But the sample output: "7 3 6 5 2 1 4"

            Let's check:

                7: arrives first -> no subordinate? works? 
                3: arrives second: subordinates? only 7? present? yes, and working? count=1 -> A3=0 -> 1>0 -> doesn't work.
                6: no subordinate? works.
                5: no subordinate? works.
                2: subordinates: 3,5,6,7? 
                     present: 3,6,5,7? 
                     working: 7,6,5 -> count=3 -> A2=2 -> 3>2 -> doesn't work.
                1: subordinates: all? present: 7,3,6,5,2? 
                     working: 7,6,5 -> count=3 -> A1=4 -> 3<=4 -> works.
                4: no subordinate? works.

                Working: 7,6,5,1,4 -> 5.

            So both are valid.

          Therefore, we can output our permutation.

          Implementation:

            We must be cautious about the indices: we use 1-indexing.

            Steps:

                #include <iostream>
                #include <vector>
                #include <queue>

                    vector<int> A(N+1);
                    for (int i=1; i<=N; i++) {
                        cin >> A[i];
                    }
                    vector<vector<int>> children(N+1);
                    for (int i=2; i<=N; i++) {

                        cin >> p;
                        children[p].push_back(i);
                    }

                    // We do a BFS from root? Actually, we need reverse topological order: we can use a queue that starts from the root? Then we process children only when all children are processed? -> we need the out-degree? 

                    // Alternatively, we do a DFS from the root? But the tree is big? We do iterative DFS? 

                    // We use a stack for DFS? 

                    vector<int> order; // from root to leaves? but we want leaves first? 
                    stack<int> st;
                    st.push(1);
                    vector<int> parent(N+1, 0);
                    // We don't need parent? 
                    // We want to process a node after all its children are processed? Then we do a postorder traversal.

                }

          Note: we used long long for L, R, T? because the sum might be up to 500000 * 500000? worst-case chain? 
                Actually, worst-case: the min_node for the root is about N? Then the children: the root has one child? Then L for the root = min_node of the child = about N-1? Then the root: L = N-1? Then the root's min_node = (N-1>=A[1]+1)? ... 
                But the sum for the root: the children of the root: each child's subtree has min_node = O(size of subtree). Then worst-case the root has many children? the entire tree? Then the sum L for the root is the sum of min_node for each child, and the min_node for a child is the size of the subtree? Then worst-case the root has two children: one of size 1, and one of size N-2? Then L = 1 + (min_node for the big child) and the min_node for the big child is at least the size of the subtree? 

                Actually, the min_node for a subtree: worst-case, the entire tree? the root of the subtree: min_node = size of the subtree? (if we have a chain? then min_node for a chain: 
                    leaf: 1
                    parent: min_node = (1>=A[u]+1)? ... 
                But A[u] is at least 0? 

                How to compute min_node for a chain? 

                    Leaf: min=1.
                    Parent of leaf: 
                         L = 1
                         min = (1>=A[u]+1) ? 1 : 2.
                    Then if A[u]>=0, then 1>=A[u]+1? only if A[u]<=0? 
                    So if A[u] is 0, then min = 1? 
                    if A[u] is 1, then 1>=2? false -> min=2.

                Then the root of a chain of n nodes: min_node = n? 

                Then the entire tree: the root: L = min_node for each child? and the children are chains? then L = O(n). Then we don't need long long? because n<=500000? 

                But worst-case: the root has 500000 children? each child is a leaf? then L = 500000.

                Then we can use int? 

                But k_val[u] is at most 500000? 

                However, we do: R = sum max_node for children? for the root: if each child is a leaf, then max_node[child]=1, then R=500000? 

                Then max_node for the root = R+1 = 500001? 

                Then we can use int? 

                But the assignment: T = k_val[u] - 1? for the root: k_val[1]=K (<=500000) then T = K-1? 

                Then we do: rem = T - L, which is at most 500000? 

                So we can use int? 

                But the problem: the min_node for a child might be large? 

                Actually, the maximum min_node for a node is at most the size of the subtree? 

                Then the total L for the root is at most the total number of nodes? which is N.

                Similarly, max_node for a node is at most (size of subtree) + ...? 

                Actually, our recurrence: 
                    max_node[u] = R+1, where R = sum_{v} max_node[v].

                Then worst-case: the entire tree: 
                    max_node[leaf] = 1.
                    for a node u with k children: 
                         max_node[u] = (sum_{v} max_node[v]) + 1.

                Then the maximum max_node for the root is the number of nodes? 

                Actually, it is the total number of nodes in the subtree? 

                Then for the entire tree: max_node[1] = N.

                Then R for the root = sum of max_node for the children? which is the total number of nodes in the children subtrees? = N-1? Then max_node[1]= (N-1)+1 = N.

                Then we can use int? 

                But note: we have L and R: the sum of the min_node and max_node for the children? for a node u, the sum is at most the total number of nodes? which is <=500000? 

          Therefore, we can use int.

          However, we used long long in the code? It's safe.

        Let me change to long long only for the sums? and the rest int? 

        But k_val: we stored as long long? But k_val is at most N? which is 500000? so int is enough.

        But we did:

            long long L = 0, R = 0;
            for (int v : children[u]) {
                L += min_node[v];   // min_node[v] is int
                R += max_node[v];   // max_node[v] is int
            }

        The maximum L or R: the entire tree: for the root, L = N-1? So int is enough.

        But for a node that has many children? the sum might be large? but the entire tree has N nodes, so the sum over all children of a node is at most N.

        So we can use int.

        Let me change back to int for L, R, T, and k_val? 

        But note: in the condition:

            if (k_val[u]-1 >= L && k_val[u]-1 <= R)

        k_val[u] is an int, and L and R are int.

        So we do:

            int L = 0, R = 0;

        But note: the condition for the leaf: we did long long? then we change.

        We do:

            for the leaf: 
                if (k_val[u]-1 >=0 && k_val[u]-1<=0)   -> k_val[u] is int.

        So we change to int.

        However, the assignment: 

            rem = T - L;   // T and L are int.

        Then we do:

            long long rem = T - L;   // but T and L are int? then rem is int? 

        We can do:

            int rem = T - L;

        But T and L are int? and T>=L? then rem>=0.

        Then we do:

            for each child: 
                int add = min(rem, max_node[v]-min_node[v]);   // which is at most 500000? 

        Then we store k_val[v] = min_node[v] + add; // which is in [min_node[v], max_node[v]]

        So we can do.

        But note: the problem constraints: N up to 500000, so the maximum min_node or max_node is at most 500000? Then the sum L for the root is at most 500000? So int is safe.

        Let me use int.

        Code:

            // Change to int for L, R, T, rem.

        However, in the condition for Option2a: 

            k_val[u]-1 <= min(R, (long long)A[u])

        We changed to:

            k_val[u]-1 <= min(R, A[u])

        But A[u] is int, R is int.

        So it's okay.

        Let me run the sample Input #2? 

        But we already computed by hand? and it worked.

        Now we output the permutation: 

            For the sample Input #2, we got: 1,7,3,5,6,2,4.

        But the sample output is 7 3 6 5 2 1 4.

        But both are valid.

        We output: 1 7 3 5 6 2 4.

        The problem: the sample output is one of the solutions? 

        So we are done.

        However, we must be cautious: the assignment for the children: we sorted by (max_node[v]-min_node[v]) descending? 

        Why? To avoid having a big gap? 

        Actually, we want to assign the extra 'rem' as much as possible to the children that have the largest (max-min)? 

        This is a greedy: we assign as much as possible to the child that has the largest slack? 

        This ensures that we can assign the entire rem? 

        This is correct.

        We'll submit the code.

        Note: the sample Input #1: we output -1.

        Let me test with a small chain.

        Chain of 1 node: 
            N=1, K=?
            min_1: leaf -> min_1=1, max_1=1.
            Then if K=1: 
                Step 6: 
                   u=1: 
                      children: none -> then we do the leaf branch: 
                         if (1-1=0 in [0,0]) -> true -> type[1]=0.
                Then output: 
                    output_stack: (1,0) -> pop: state0, type0 -> output 1, and then push children? none.

                Then output: 1.

        Then the permutation: 1.

        Condition: employee1: arrives first -> works? -> total=1 -> matches.

        If K=0: then not in [1,1] -> output -1.

        So it works.

        Code: 

          We assume the entire tree is stored in children[1..N].

          We do:

            // Step 4: compute min_node and max_node for each node.

            // We do a DFS for postorder? 

          We use iterative DFS for postorder? 

          But note: the tree is a tree? so we can do:

            stack for DFS: 

          We'll do iterative DFS for postorder as above.

          We hope it runs in O(n).

        Let me write the code accordingly.

        Note: the children of a node: we stored as a vector? and we iterate over them.

        We'll run on the constraints: n=500000? 

        The BFS for assignment: each node we do a sort of the children? The degree of the node: worst-case the root has 500000 children? Then sorting O(degree*log(degree))? worst-case 500000*log(500000) per node? But the root is the only one with 500000 children? Then total O(n log n)? 

        Then the entire algorithm is O(n log n)? 

        This is acceptable for n=500000? 

        In C++ it should run in 1 second.

        Let me code accordingly.

        One more note: the array for children: we stored as a vector? 

        We'll write the code accordingly.

        We'll submit.

        Note: we must be cautious for the leaf branch in Step 6: we set type[u] and then we do continue? and we don't push any child? 

        For leaf: we don't push any child? 

        Then the BFS for the children stops.

        Correct.

        Let me write the code.

        We'll test with the sample Input #2.

        Due to the complexity, we output the code.

        Note: the problem says the memory limit is 1024 MB? We are storing vectors for the tree, and several arrays of size n, and the stack for DFS? Then total memory O(n)? 

        We'll write the code.

        IMPORTANT: we must not output anything extra.

        Code:

          We use: 
            #include <iostream>
            #include <vector>
            #include <queue>
            #include <stack>
            #include <algorithm>
            #include <cctype>
            using namespace std;

          And then the main function.

        Let me write.
