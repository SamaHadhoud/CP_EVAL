We are given two trees on the same set of N vertices. We can perform operations that consist of:
  - Removing an existing edge and then adding a new edge to reconnect the tree (so the graph remains a tree after the operation).

We wish to find the minimum number of operations required to transform the first tree into the second.

Observation:
Each operation changes one edge. However, note that we are allowed to remove any edge and then add any edge (as long as the graph remains a tree). Therefore, one operation can change one edge to another.

But note: the operations must maintain the tree structure. We cannot create cycles or disconnect the tree.

We can think of the problem as: we start with tree T1 and we want to end with tree T2. We are allowed to swap one edge for another in each operation, but the graph must remain a tree at each step.

Alternatively, we can note that the set of edges in T1 and T2 might have some edges in common. The edges that are in both trees do not need to be changed. For the edges that are not in common, we have to fix them.

However, one operation might fix more than one edge? Actually, one operation removes one edge and adds one edge. Therefore, if we remove an edge that is not in T2 and add an edge that is in T2, we are effectively fixing one missing edge and one extra edge.

But note: the operations are sequential. We can also consider that we are allowed to remove an edge that we don't want and then add an edge that we do want. However, sometimes one operation can fix two edges: the removal of an edge that is not in the target and the addition of an edge that is in the target.

But how many operations are required? Let E1 be the set of edges in the first tree and E2 the set of edges in the second tree.

We know that the first tree has edges E1 and the second has edges E2. The edges that we want to remove are those in E1 \ E2, and the edges we want to add are those in E2 \ E1.

Let k = |E1 \ E2| = |E2 \ E1|. Then, if we can do one operation that removes one bad edge and adds one good edge, then we need k operations? But note: we cannot necessarily remove any bad edge arbitrarily and then add any good edge arbitrarily because the graph must remain connected.

However, there is a known result: the minimum number of operations required to transform one tree into another is exactly k (the number of edges that are in the first tree but not in the second, which is the same as the number of edges in the second tree but not in the first). But we have to be cautious: sometimes we cannot do k operations arbitrarily? Actually, we can always do k operations: remove one edge from E1\E2 and then add one edge from E2\E1. But the problem is that after removing an edge, we have two components. We must add an edge that connects the two components. However, the edge we add might not be the one we want arbitrarily? Actually, we are allowed to add any edge that reconnects the tree. But we are required to end up with exactly E2.

Therefore, we can consider that the problem reduces to k. However, the sample input:

Sample Input #1:
4
Edges of T1: [ (1,2), (2,3), (3,4) ]
Edges of T2: [ (3,1), (4,1), (2,4) ]

Here, T1 has edges: { (1,2), (2,3), (3,4) }
T2 has edges: { (3,1), (4,1), (2,4) }

The common edges: none? So k = 3. Then the answer would be 3? And the sample output is 3.

But why is the answer 3? Because we have to change all three edges.

However, what if we have common edges? Then k would be less. But note: the problem asks for the minimum number of operations.

But wait: is it always k? Consider:

Operation 1: Remove an edge from E1\E2 and add an edge from E2\E1. Then the new tree has one less bad edge and one more good edge. Then we require k operations.

But we must ensure that at each step we can actually add an edge that is in E2\E1 and that is suitable for reconnecting the two components? Actually, we are not forced to add an edge that is in E2\E1? However, we want to end with T2, so we must eventually add all edges in E2\E1. Also, we are allowed to add any edge as long as it reconnects the tree. But note: if we add an edge that is not in E2, then we might have to remove it later? That would be inefficient.

Therefore, the key is: we can always plan the operations so that we only add edges that are in E2. Similarly, we remove edges that are not in E2.

But the problem: when we remove an edge, we break the tree into two components. Then we must add an edge that connects the two components. However, the target tree T2 has a specific set of edges. In T2, there is exactly one edge that connects the two components? Actually, no: because T2 is a tree, the edge that we are going to add from E2\E1 that will eventually be present must connect the two components? Not necessarily: we might have multiple candidate edges in E2\E1 that connect the two components. But we are free to choose any? Actually, we are free to choose any edge that reconnects the two components? And we want to add one that is in E2\E1? Why not? Because we need that edge in the final tree.

But note: it might be that the edge we want to add from E2\E1 is not available because it doesn't connect the two components? Then we cannot add it? Actually, we can only add an edge that connects the two components. Therefore, we must choose an edge from E2\E1 that does connect the two components? But wait: the final tree T2 is connected, so in T2 the two components must be connected by exactly one edge? Actually, in the final tree, the two components are connected by an edge that is in E2. However, at the moment we break the tree, the two components are defined arbitrarily? And the target tree T2 might have an edge that connects the two components? Actually, in the target tree, the entire tree is connected and the edge set E2 must contain at least one edge that goes between the two components? But note: the two components we get from breaking the current tree are arbitrary. However, the target tree T2 is fixed. The edge that we are going to add must be an edge that is in E2 and that is missing (so in E2\E1) and that connects the two components? But is that always true?

Actually, consider: after we remove an edge (u, v), we get two components: one containing u and the other containing v. In the target tree T2, there must be a unique path from u to v. Since T2 is a tree, the unique path must use an edge that connects the two components? Actually, the entire path from u to v in T2 goes from the u-component to the v-component at exactly one edge. Therefore, there is at least one edge in E2 that goes between the two components. Moreover, we are free to choose any edge that reconnects the two components? But note: we are required to end up with T2. However, we don't have to add the exact edge that is in T2 at this step? Actually, we can add any edge that reconnects the two components? But then we might add an edge that is not in E2? That would be bad because then we have an edge that we don't want. Therefore, we must add an edge that is in E2 (so that we don't have to remove it later). 

But note: we are allowed to do several operations. However, we can only add one edge per operation. Therefore, we should add an edge that is in E2 and that is missing (so in E2\E1). And such an edge must exist? Because T2 is connected, there must be at least one edge in E2 that goes between the two components? Actually, yes: because in T2, u and v are connected, and the unique path from u to v in T2 must cross the cut (the two components) at least once? Actually, exactly once: because the graph is a tree, so the path goes through exactly one edge that crosses the cut.

Therefore, at each operation, we can remove an edge that is in E1\E2 (a bad edge) and then add an edge from E2\E1 that is between the two components (which must exist). Then after k operations, we have replaced all the bad edges.

Therefore, the answer is k = |E1\E2|.

But wait: what if we remove an edge that is in E1\E2, and then add an edge from E2\E1 that is between the two components. Then we have reduced the number of bad edges by one? Actually, we remove one bad edge (so bad edges decrease by one) and we add one good edge (so the good edges increase by one). Therefore, the set of edges that are not in E2 (the bad edges) decreases by one? Actually, the set of edges that are in E1 but not in E2: we remove one of them. And we add an edge that is in E2 but not in E1: so we are increasing the set of edges that are in E2 but not in E1? But note: the edge we added is now in the tree. However, we started with E1, and we removed an edge from E1\E2 and added an edge from E2\E1. Then the new set of edges is: (E1 without that one edge) union {the new edge}. Then the symmetric difference decreases by 2? Because we removed one that was only in E1 and we added one that was only in E2. So the symmetric difference is reduced by 2. Therefore, after one operation, k becomes k-2? 

Wait, that contradicts. Actually, the symmetric difference is |E1 Δ E2| = |E1\E2| + |E2\E1|. Initially, let a = |E1\E2| and b = |E2\E1|. Note that a = b? Actually, because both trees have exactly n-1 edges, so the symmetric difference must be even? Actually, |E1| = |E2| = n-1. Then |E1\E2| = |E2\E1|? Because |E1| = |E1 ∩ E2| + |E1\E2|, |E2| = |E1 ∩ E2| + |E2\E1|, so |E1\E2| = |E2\E1|. Therefore, k = |E1\E2| = |E2\E1|, and the symmetric difference is 2k.

After one operation: we remove an edge from E1\E2 and add an edge from E2\E1. Then:
  - The set E1\E2 loses one element: becomes k-1.
  - The set E2\E1 loses one element (because we added one that was missing, so now it's in the tree) but wait: we added an edge that was in E2\E1, so now that edge is in the current tree. Then the set of edges that are in the current tree but not in E2: we have removed one bad edge and added a good edge. Therefore, the edges that are in the current tree but not in E2: we had k such edges (from E1\E2) and we removed one, so now k-1. The edges that are in E2 but not in the current tree: we had k, and we added one, so now k-1. Therefore, the symmetric difference becomes 2*(k-1). So we reduced k by 1? Actually, we reduced the count of |E_current \ E2| and |E2 \ E_current| each by 1? But note: the edge we removed was in E1\E2: so it was in E_current \ E2. The edge we added was in E2\E1: so it was in E2 \ E_current. Therefore, after the operation, that removed edge is gone (so E_current\E2 loses one) and the added edge is now in E_current and in E2? So it is no longer in E2\E_current. Therefore, both sets decrease by one. So the symmetric difference decreases by 2, and k (the common value for the two sets) decreases by 1.

Therefore, we start with k and we require k operations? Because after each operation k becomes k-1, so we do k operations to get k=0.

Thus, the answer is k = |E1\E2|.

But the sample: k=3, so 3 operations.

Therefore, we only need to compute k = |E1\E2|.

But note: n can be up to 10^5. We cannot compute set difference by storing all edges and then doing set operations because the edges are undirected and might be stored in either order.

We need to check: if an edge (u, v) in the first tree is present in the second tree? How? We can store the edges of the second tree in a set (or a hash set) but we have to normalize the edges: store as (min(u,v), max(u,v)).

But then the memory is about 10^5 edges, which is acceptable.

Steps:

1. Read n.
2. Read the first tree: n-1 edges.
   - Store each edge as (min(u,v), max(u,v)) in a set? Actually, we can store in a set S1 and also we can store the edges of the first tree in a list for building the tree? But for the common edge check, we only need the set representation.

Alternatively, we can:

  - Build a set for the edges of the second tree (with normalized edges: (min, max)).
  - Then, for each edge in the first tree, check if its normalized form is in that set.

  Then k = number of edges in the first tree that are not in the second tree.

But note: the problem does not guarantee that the edges in the input are normalized? So we must normalize when storing.

Therefore:

  set_edges2 = set()
  for the second tree's n-1 edges:
      read u, v
      store as (min(u,v), max(u,v)) in set_edges2.

  k = 0
  for each edge in the first tree:
      let a = min(u,v), b = max(u,v)
      if (a, b) not in set_edges2:
          k += 1

  Then output k.

But wait: the sample input:

First tree edges: 
  1-2 -> (1,2)
  2-3 -> (2,3)
  3-4 -> (3,4)

Second tree edges:
  3-1 -> (1,3)
  4-1 -> (1,4)
  2-4 -> (2,4)

Now, for the first tree:
  (1,2): not in second? second has (1,3), (1,4), (2,4) -> not present.
  (2,3): not present? (2,3) is not in the second set -> not present.
  (3,4): not present? (3,4) is not in the second set -> not present.

So k=3.

Therefore, the answer is 3.

But let me test with a common edge.

Sample 2:

Input:
3
1 2
2 3
1 2
1 3

First tree: edges (1,2), (2,3) -> normalized: (1,2), (2,3) -> but (2,3) is (2,3)
Second tree: edges (1,2), (1,3) -> normalized: (1,2), (1,3)

Then the common edge is (1,2). So the first tree has one edge (2,3) that is not in the second, and the second tree has one edge (1,3) that is not in the first. Then k = 1.

Therefore, the answer is 1.

But what if we do the operation: remove (2,3) -> then the two components: [1,2] and [3]. Then we need to add an edge that connects [1,2] and [3]. We can add (1,3) which is the target edge. Then we end with edges: (1,2) and (1,3) -> which is the target. So one operation.

Therefore, the algorithm holds.

However, note: the above reasoning is standard for the "tree edit distance" by edge operations. This problem is known to be solvable by counting the edges that are in the first tree but not in the second.

But wait: I recall that in some problems (like CodeForces) there is a problem that asks for the same thing and the answer is |E1\E2|. However, I also remember that sometimes the answer is k = (n-1) - |common_edges|, which is the same as |E1\E2|.

Therefore, the solution is to compute the number of edges in the first tree that are not in the second tree.

But note: the edges are undirected and the representation (min, max) is safe.

Complexity: O(n log n) which is acceptable for n <= 10^5.

Let me code the idea in pseudocode:

  n = int(input())
  edges1 = []
  for i in range(n-1):
      u, v = map(int, input().split())
      edges1.append((min(u, v), max(u, v)))

  edges2 = set()
  for i in range(n-1):
      u, v = map(int, input().split())
      edges2.add((min(u, v), max(u, v)))

  k = 0
  for edge in edges1:
      if edge not in edges2:
          k += 1

  print(k)

But wait, the sample input has:

  4
  1 2
  2 3
  3 4
  then the second tree:
  3 1
  4 1
  2 4

This gives k=3.

However, the problem statement says that the second tree starts from the (N+1)-th line to the (2N-1)-th line. So we read 3 more edges.

But note: the first tree is the next n-1 lines, and then the second tree is the next n-1 lines.

Therefore, the code above is correct.

But wait: what if the same edge is given in different order? Our normalization (min, max) takes care of that.

Therefore, we have:

  Read n
  Read the first tree: n-1 edges, normalize each and store in a list (or we can just iterate without storing the list? we only need to count the non-common ones).
  Read the second tree: n-1 edges, store normalized in a set.

  Then for each edge in the first tree (which we read and normalized) we check if it is in the set.

  Count the ones that are not.

  Print the count.

However, we do not need to store the entire first tree in a list? We can just:

  count = 0
  for i in range(n-1):
      u, v = map(int, input().split())
      edge = (min(u,v), max(u,v))
      if edge not in edges2_set:
          count += 1

But then we must have the edges2_set built.

But note: we read the second tree after the first? Actually, no: the input order is:

  first line: n
  next n-1 lines: first tree
  next n-1 lines: second tree.

So we have to read the first tree first? Actually, we can read the first tree and then the second.

But the problem: we need the second tree to build the set first? Actually, we can read the first tree edges and then the second tree edges? But we don't need to store the first tree edges beyond the counting? We can:

  Step 1: read n.
  Step 2: read the first tree and store each normalized edge in a list? Or we can simply not store and just build the set for the second tree? Actually, we cannot check until we have the second tree set.

So:

  n = int(input().strip())

  # Read first tree: we don't need to store the edges beyond the normalization for checking? Actually, we can build a set for the first tree? But then we don't need to? Because we are going to count the edges that are not in the second set.

  But we can do:

      edges1 = []
      for i in range(n-1):
          u, v = map(int, input().split())
          edges1.append( (min(u,v), max(u,v)) )

      edges2_set = set()
      for i in range(n-1):
          u, v = map(int, input().split())
          edges2_set.add( (min(u,v), max(u,v)) )

      k = 0
      for edge in edges1:
          if edge not in edges2_set:
              k += 1

      print(k)

But this is O(n) for the loop and O(1) for each set lookup? So overall O(n log n) because of the set? Actually, set lookup is O(1) average? But worst-case O(n) if there are many collisions? However, we can use a hash set and n is 10^5, which is acceptable.

But worst-case the set might have 10^5 elements. The set in Python uses a hash table and should be O(1) per lookup. So overall O(n).

But note: worst-case n=10^5, so 10^5 lookups and building a set of 10^5: total O(n) which is acceptable.

Therefore, the solution is straightforward.

However, there is an alternative without sets? We can use a union-find or something? But that would be more complicated and we are only counting the common edges.

But the above is simple.

But wait: is there a possibility that the same edge appears twice? The input says: the edges of a tree, so no duplicate.

Therefore, the solution is:

  n = int(input().strip())
  edges1 = [tuple(sorted(map(int, input().split()))) for _ in range(n-1)]
  edges2 = set(tuple(sorted(map(int, input().split()))) for _ in range(n-1))

  count = 0
  for edge in edges1:
      if edge not in edges2:
          count += 1

  print(count)

But note: sorting the tuple for each edge? We can do (min, max) without sorting? Actually, we can do:

  u, v = map(int, input().split())
  edge = (u, v) if u < v else (v, u)

But same effect.

But the set for edges2: we build by normalizing each edge.

However, we must be cautious: the set lookup for a normalized edge: we built edges2 with normalized edges, and we are checking normalized edges from edges1. So it's consistent.

But what about performance? Building the set for edges2: n-1 edges, each normalized: O(n). Then iterating over edges1: O(n). Each set lookup is O(1). Total O(n).

But worst-case n=10^5: building a set of 10^5 elements is acceptable in Python? The problem says memory 1024 MB, so yes.

Therefore, we can code accordingly.

But wait: the sample output is 3 for the sample input.

However, I recall that in some problems the answer is not simply the symmetric difference? Actually, I remember a problem: you can do one operation that removes one edge and adds one edge, so the number of operations is the number of edges that are in the first tree and not in the second. But why then is the sample 3? Because all edges are different.

But what if we have:

  n=2
  first tree: (1,2)
  second tree: (1,2) -> then k=0, so 0 operations.

Another: 
  n=2
  first tree: (1,2)
  second tree: (2,1) -> but normalized to (1,2) -> so k=0.

Another:
  n=3
  first tree: (1,2), (2,3)
  second tree: (1,2), (1,3) -> k=1.

Therefore, the answer is indeed k.

But I recall that in some problems the answer is (k+1)//2? But that is for a different operation? Actually, no: the operation defined here is: remove one edge and add one edge to reconnect. This operation reduces k by 1? Because we remove one bad edge and add one good edge? Then the total operations is k.

But why then the problem is non‐trivial? Actually, the non‐trivial part is that we have to realize that we can always add a good edge that is in the target tree and that reconnects the two components. Therefore, the plan is always feasible.

Therefore, the solution is to output k = the number of edges in the first tree that are not in the second tree.

But note: the problem states that the trees are connected and have n-1 edges.

Therefore, we are done.

But wait: the problem "Tree" in CodeForces: "A. Tree" (I don't remember the exact code) but there is a problem that uses exactly this idea.

So we write the code accordingly.

However, to be safe, let me check with a known example:

Example: 
  n=3
  T1: (1,2), (1,3)
  T2: (1,2), (2,3)

Then the common edge is (1,2). The edges in T1 that are not in T2: (1,3). So k=1.

Operation: remove (1,3) -> then we have two components: [1,2] and [3]. Then we add (2,3). Then we get T2. So one operation.

Therefore, k=1 -> output 1.

Another: 
  n=4
  T1: (1,2), (2,3), (3,4)
  T2: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)   -> [a star]

Common edge: (1,2) is in both? Actually, no: in T2 we have (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). Then the common edge is (1,2). Then k for T1: 
  (1,2) -> common -> skip.
  (2,3) -> not in T2 -> k=1
  (3,4) -> not in T2 -> k=2

But wait: the normalized representation: 
  T1: (1,2), (2,3), (3,4)
  T2: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)

Then the edges in T1 not in T2: (2,3) and (3,4). So k=2.

But how many operations?

Operation 1: remove (3,4). Then we break the tree into two components: [1,2,3] and [4]. Then we can add (1,4) (which is in T2). Now the tree becomes: (1,2), (2,3), (1,4). 

Now, the edges we have: 
  (1,2): common -> good.
  (2,3): not in T2? T2 has (1,3) and (1,4). So (2,3) is not in T2 -> bad.
  (1,4): good.

Then we have one bad edge: (2,3).

Operation 2: remove (2,3). Then we break the tree: [1,2] and [3,4] (because we have (1,4) so 4 is connected to 1, and 3 is isolated? Actually, after removing (2,3), the tree becomes two components: one with [1,2,4] and [3]. Then we add (1,3). Then we have (1,2), (1,4), (1,3) -> which is T2.

Therefore, 2 operations.

So the answer is 2.

Therefore, the algorithm: k=2 -> output 2.

So the solution is indeed k.

Therefore, we output k.

So the code:

  n = int(input().strip())
  edges1 = []
  for i in range(n-1):
      data = input().split()
      if not data: continue
      u = int(data[0]); v = int(data[1])
      if u > v:
          u, v = v, u
      edges1.append((u, v))

  edges2_set = set()
  for i in range(n-1):
      data = input().split()
      if not data: continue
      u = int(data[0]); v = int(data[1])
      if u > v:
          u, v = v, u
      edges2_set.add((u, v))

  count = 0
  for edge in edges1:
      if edge not in edges2_set:
          count += 1

  print(count)

But note: the problem constraints: n up to 10^5, so we have to be efficient.

In Python, building a set of 10^5 tuples of two integers: each tuple is 28 bytes? And the set: about 100000 * (overhead) -> in practice, the memory should be acceptable (1024 MB).

Therefore, we write the code accordingly.

However, the problem says memory limit 1024 MB, and 10^5 edges: the set will take about 10^5 * (size of tuple) which is about 10^5 * (2 * 28) for the tuple? Actually, the tuple of two integers is 28*2? But actually, the tuple itself has a fixed overhead and then two pointers? In Python, a tuple of two integers might be 28 bytes (for the tuple object) plus the integers themselves? But integers are stored as objects? Actually, small integers are interned, but the tuple of two integers: the memory might be about 28 (tuple) + 2 * 24 (for the integer objects) -> but wait: small integers are cached and the integers themselves are not duplicated? Actually, the memory for the set: the set uses a hash table. The set of 10^5 elements might take about 10^5 * (about 1.5 * (size of an entry))? The entry is a reference to the tuple. The tuple is 28 bytes? And then the set also has the hash table buckets.

But 1024 MB is 10^6 KB? Actually, 1024 MB = 1024 * 1024 KB = 1048576 KB -> 1024 MB = 1024 * 1024 * 1024 bytes = 1073741824 bytes.

10^5 elements: if each element in the set (the bucket structure) takes about 24 bytes? Then 10^5 * 24 = 2.4e6 bytes -> 2.4 MB. Then the tuples: 10^5 * (say 28 bytes) = 2.8e6 bytes. So total under 10 MB. Therefore, it is acceptable.

Therefore, we output the count.

But wait: what if the input has duplicate edges? The problem states: the edges of a tree, so no duplicates. And the edges are undirected and the two vertices are distinct.

Therefore, we are safe.

Let me run the sample input:

  n=4
  edges1 = [ (1,2), (2,3), (3,4) ] -> normalized: (1,2), (2,3), (3,4)
  edges2 = [ (3,1), (4,1), (2,4) ] -> normalized: (1,3), (1,4), (2,4)

  Then:
      (1,2) not in edges2? -> True -> count=1
      (2,3) not in edges2? -> True -> count=2
      (3,4) not in edges2? -> True -> count=3

  Output 3.

Therefore, it matches.

Final code in Python:

Note: we must be cautious for large input: use sys.stdin if necessary? But the problem says 1.0s for n=10^5. In Python, 10^5 iterations is acceptable.

So:

  import sys

  data = sys.stdin.read().split()
  if not data: 
      print(0)
      exit(0)

  n = int(data[0])
  index = 1
  edges1 = []
  for i in range(n-1):
      u = int(data[index]); v = int(data[index+1]); index += 2
      if u > v:
          u, v = v, u
      edges1.append((u, v))

  edges2_set = set()
  for i in range(n-1):
      u = int(data[index]); v = int(data[index+1]); index += 2
      if u > v:
          u, v = v, u
      edges2_set.add((u, v))

  count = 0
  for edge in edges1:
      if edge not in edges2_set:
          count += 1

  print(count)

But we can also read without sys.stdin:

  n = int(input().strip())
  edges1 = []
  for i in range(n-1):
      u, v = map(int, input().split())
      if u > v:
          u, v = v, u
      edges1.append((u, v))

  edges2_set = set()
  for i in range(n-1):
      u, v = map(int, input().split())
      if u > v:
          u, v = v, u
      edges2_set.add((u, v))

  count = 0
  for edge in edges1:
      if edge not in edges2_set:
          count += 1

  print(count)

This should work.

But note: the problem input has 2n-2 lines. The first n-1 for the first tree, then next n-1 for the second tree.

We are reading exactly that.

Therefore, we output the count.

But wait: I just thought: what if the second tree has an edge that is the same as the first tree but in a different representation? We normalized so it doesn't matter.

So we are done.

However, to be thorough, we note that the problem is well-known and the solution is standard.

Therefore, the answer is the number of edges in the first tree that are not present in the second tree.

Let me write the editorial accordingly.

Editorial:

## Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: We are given two trees on the same set of n vertices. The goal is to transform the first tree into the second tree using the minimum number of operations. Each operation consists of removing an edge and adding another edge to maintain the tree structure (connected and acyclic).

2. **Key Insight**: Each operation allows us to replace one edge in the current tree with another edge. Notice that the edges present in both trees do not require any operation. The edges that are only in the first tree (and not in the second) must be removed, and the edges that are only in the second tree (and not in the first) must be added. 

3. **Observation**: Since each operation removes one edge and adds one edge, and we can always choose to remove an edge that is not in the second tree and add an edge that is in the second tree (and that reconnects the tree appropriately), each operation can fix one edge (i.e., remove one unwanted edge and add one desired edge). Therefore, the number of operations required is exactly the number of edges in the first tree that are not in the second tree.

4. **Algorithm Selection**: 
   - Read the number of vertices, `n`.
   - Read the edges of the first tree and store each edge in normalized form (i.e., as a tuple `(min(u, v), max(u, v))`).
   - Read the edges of the second tree and store each normalized edge in a set for efficient lookups.
   - Count the number of edges in the first tree that are not present in the second tree (using the normalized representation and the set for the second tree).
   - Output this count.

5. **Complexity Analysis**: 
   - **Time Complexity**: O(n) for reading the input and O(n) for the lookups. The set operations (insertion and lookup) are O(1) on average. Therefore, the total time complexity is O(n).
   - **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the edges of the second tree in a set and the edges of the first tree in a list.

## Solution Code
```python
import sys

def main():
    data = sys.stdin.read().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    edges1 = []
    index = 1
    for i in range(n - 1):
        u = int(data[index])
        v = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        if u > v:
            u, v = v, u
        edges1.append((u, v))
    
    edges2_set = set()
    for i in range(n - 1):
        u = int(data[index])
        v = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        if u > v:
            u, v = v, u
        edges2_set.add((u, v))
    
    count = 0
    for edge in edges1:
        if edge not in edges2_set:
            count += 1
            
    print(count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first value is `n`, the number of vertices.
2. **First Tree Edges**: The next `n-1` lines (edges of the first tree) are read and each edge is normalized (so that the smaller vertex comes first in the tuple) and stored in a list.
3. **Second Tree Edges**: The subsequent `n-1` lines (edges of the second tree) are read, normalized, and stored in a set for O(1) membership checks.
4. **Counting Mismatched Edges**: For each edge in the first tree, we check if it exists in the second tree (using the set). If it does not, we increment our count.
5. **Output Result**: The count, representing the number of edges in the first tree that are not in the second tree, is printed. This count is the minimum number of operations required to transform the first tree into the second tree, as each operation can remove one such edge and replace it with a missing edge from the second tree.

This approach efficiently leverages set operations to determine the edge difference between the two trees, leading to an optimal solution.
