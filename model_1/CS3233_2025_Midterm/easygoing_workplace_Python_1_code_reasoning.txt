 Okay, we are given:
   N, K: number of employees and target number of employees that do work.
   A: list of A_i (work tolerance levels) for employees 1 to N.
   B: list of N-1 integers, for i=2 to N, the direct superior of employee i is B_i.

 The problem: 
   When an employee i arrives, he will do work only if at that moment at most A_i of his subordinates have already arrived and are doing work? 
   But note: the condition is: when employee i arrives, he sees the subordinates that have already arrived and are doing work. However, note that:
      - The condition is about the subordinates that are present (so arrived already) and that are actually working (so not slacking).

   However, note: a subordinate that has arrived might be slacking? But the condition for a subordinate to be working is that when that subordinate arrived, 
   at most A_j of his own subordinates were present and working. So the state (working or not) of each employee is determined at his arrival and then fixed.

   The problem is: we want an order of arrival such that exactly K employees are working.

 How do we think?
   Let's define:
     - The subtree of an employee: including the employee and all his subordinates.

   The key observation: The condition for an employee i to work is: at the moment of his arrival, at most A_i of his subordinates (that have arrived so far) are working.

   But note: if a subordinate of i has arrived but is not working, then that subordinate doesn't count toward the limit.

   Therefore, the working condition for i: when i arrives, let w be the number of his direct or indirect subordinates that have arrived and are working. Then if w <= A_i, i works.

   However, note: the condition only counts the subordinates that are working. So if a subordinate j of i arrived and is not working (because when j arrived, too many of j's subordinates were working), then j doesn't count.

   How to approach?

   Alternate approach: we note that the working status of each employee is determined by the order of arrival. However, the problem is asking for an order that achieves exactly K employees working.

   We can consider the following:

   Step 1: Precompute the children of each employee and build the tree.

   Step 2: We note that the CEO (employee 1) must work? Not necessarily: if the CEO arrives and at that time there are already more than A_1 of his subordinates (that are working) then the CEO might not work. But note: the CEO arrives at some time, and at that time, the subordinates that have arrived are the ones that came earlier. However, the CEO has no superior so his condition is independent? 

   However, the problem is complex because the state of the subordinates (working or not) affects the condition for the superior.

   Insight: We can use a DFS and then determine the minimum and maximum possible number of employees that can work? 

   Actually, we can try to compute the minimum and maximum possible working employees in the entire company. Then if K is not in [min_work, max_work], output -1.

   How to compute the min and max? 

   We can do a DFS from the leaves to the root. For each node, we can compute:

     Let f(u) = the minimum number of employees that must work in the subtree of u? 
        But note: actually we can have a range? 

   Alternatively, we can note:

     For a node u, when u arrives, the condition is: the number of working subordinates of u that have arrived before u must be <= A_u. However, note that after u arrives, more subordinates might arrive, but they don't affect u's condition.

   Therefore, the condition for u only depends on the set of subordinates that have arrived before u and that are working. 

   How can we control the working status? 

   Actually, we can consider that we can choose the order arbitrarily. Therefore, we can try to maximize or minimize the number of working employees in the entire tree.

   Let's define:

     Let dp_min[u] = minimum possible number of working employees in the subtree of u?
     Let dp_max[u] = maximum possible number of working employees in the subtree of u?

   How to compute?

     For a leaf u: 
        When u arrives, he has no subordinate (so 0 working subordinates). Then if A_u >= 0 (which it always is) then u works? 
        Actually, condition: 0 <= A_u -> so u works. 
        But wait: if A_u is 0? then 0<=0 -> works. So leaf always works? 
        However, what if A_u is negative? but A_i is in [0, N-1] so we don't have negatives.

        Therefore, for a leaf: min and max are both 1.

     For an internal node u:

        The condition: when u arrives, the number of working subordinates of u that have arrived before u must be <= A_u.

        However, note: after u arrives, more subordinates might come, but they don't affect u.

        So the condition only depends on the working subordinates that are already present at u's arrival.

        How we can arrange the order? We can choose the order arbitrarily. Therefore:

          To maximize the total working employees in u's subtree:

            We want u to work if possible. How to maximize the chance that u works? We can try to minimize the number of working subordinates that are present when u arrives. But note: we also want to maximize the total working employees.

            Actually, we can do:

              Let the children of u be v1, v2, ..., vm.

              We can choose an order that minimizes the count of working subordinates that appear before u? 

              However, we can also choose to have u not work? 

          So we have two possibilities for u: working or not.

          Case 1: u works.
            Then we require that the number of working subordinates that arrive before u is at most A_u.

            How to maximize the total? 
              We can have u work only if we can arrange the children so that at most A_u of the working children in the entire subtree appear before u? 

            Actually, note: the condition is only about the subordinates that have arrived before u. And we can choose the order arbitrarily. So we can postpone the arrival of as many working subordinates as we want until after u arrives. Therefore, we can always avoid having more than A_u working subordinates present at u's arrival? 

            However, we cannot change the working status of the children arbitrarily. The working status of a child v is fixed by the order of the employees in the subtree of v.

            Actually, we can control the order arbitrarily, so we can choose to have the working children of u arrive after u, except for at most A_u of them? 

            Therefore, if we let the total working employees in the subtree of u be x (if u works) then:

              We can have at most A_u of u's children's subtree working employees appearing before u. The rest must appear after u (which is allowed because after u arrives, they don't affect u).

            So condition: we must be able to choose at most A_u working employees from the entire set of working employees in the children's subtrees to be before u? 

            But note: we are not forced to have all the working employees from the children's subtrees? Actually, we have control over the entire order. So we can interweave arbitrarily.

            Therefore, for u to work, we must have:

              The total working employees in the children's subtrees must be at least ...? Actually, we can always arrange the order so that no more than min(A_u, total_working_children) working children are present at u's arrival? 

            But wait: we are not limited by the total_working_children? We can choose to put at most A_u of the working children (from all children subtrees) before u. This is always possible? 

            Therefore, u can work if and only if we want it to work? Actually, regardless of the children, we can arrange the order so that at most A_u working subordinates are present at u's arrival? 

            However, what if the total working employees in the children is greater than A_u? We can still put only A_u of them before u and the rest after? 

            Therefore, if we choose to have u work, then the total working employees in u's subtree is 1 (for u) plus the total working employees from all children.

            But wait: what if we want to minimize the total? Then we might avoid having some children work? 

          Actually, the above reasoning for maximizing the total: we can have u work as long as we can arrange the children's working employees so that at most A_u are before u. And that is always possible by putting u early enough? 

          However, note: we can also choose to have u not work. Then we don't have the constraint on the children? 

          But the condition for u not working: if when u arrives, there are more than A_u working subordinates already present? 

          How can we force u not to work? We can put more than A_u working subordinates before u. And that is always possible if the total working subordinates (from children) is greater than A_u? 

          But if the total working subordinates is less than or equal to A_u, then we cannot force u not to work? because even if we put all working subordinates before u, the count is <= A_u, so u would work.

          Therefore, for a node u:

            The maximum total working employees in u's subtree is:
               1 + (sum of max_work of all children)   [if we can have u work? and we can always have u work? because we can always arrange the order to have at most min(A_u, total_working_children) before u?]

            But note: we can have u work only if we can arrange the order so that at most A_u working subordinates are present at u's arrival. And that is always possible by putting u before all but at most A_u working subordinates? 

            However, what if we want to maximize the total? Then we want u to work and we want as many children as possible to work. So max_work[u] = 1 + (sum_{v in children} max_work[v])

            But wait: what if the sum of max_work[v] is very large? We can still have u work because we can postpone the arrival of the extra working subordinates until after u.

            Therefore: max_work[u] = 1 + sum( max_work[v] for all children v )

            Now, what is the minimum?

            We can avoid having u work? But if we do, then we don't get the +1. However, we must also consider: if we force u not to work, we have to make sure that at u's arrival, there are at least A_u+1 working subordinates? 

            But note: if we want to minimize the total, we would also try to minimize the working employees in the children? Actually, we have two choices:

              Option 1: u works. Then the total is 1 + (min_work? or max_work? we are minimizing the total) -> actually we are minimizing the entire subtree.

                But note: we can also choose to minimize the children? So we can set the children to have their minimum? 

                However, the condition for u to work: we must arrange that at most A_u working subordinates are present when u arrives. But if we use the minimum configuration for the children, the total working subordinates in the children is T (the minimum). Then we can arrange the order so that at most min(A_u, T) working subordinates are present? So condition: we can have u work? and the total becomes 1 + T.

              Option 2: u does not work. Then we require that at u's arrival, at least A_u+1 working subordinates are present? 

                How to minimize the total? Then we want to have exactly A_u+1 working subordinates in the children? Actually, we can have more? but we are minimizing the total.

                We need at least A_u+1 working subordinates in the entire children? But we can arrange the order so that at least A_u+1 working subordinates are present at u's arrival? 

                How? We can put u after at least A_u+1 working subordinates? 

                But note: we are minimizing the total. We want the minimal total working employees in the subtree of u.

                Therefore, we can set the children to have at least A_u+1 working employees? and we can set the rest to be minimized? 

                Actually, we don't have to make all children have their minimal? We can choose for each child: we want the minimal total working employees in the entire subtree of u such that the total working employees in the children is at least A_u+1? 

                So: min_work[u] = min {
                        1 + T_min,   # if u works: then we use the minimal configuration for the children (T_min = sum(min_work[v] for children v))
                        T'           # if u does not work: then we need at least A_u+1 working employees in the children, and we want the minimal total working employees in the entire subtree? but note: we can also choose to have more than the minimal in the children? 

                }

                How to compute T'? 

                  We need the children to have at least A_u+1 working employees? and we want to minimize the total working employees in the entire subtree (which is just the working employees in the children, since u doesn't work).

                  Therefore, we want to choose a configuration for the children such that the total working employees is at least A_u+1, and we minimize that total.

                  But note: we can independently choose the configuration for each child? Actually, for each child v, we have two numbers: min_work[v] and max_work[v]. And we can choose any number in the range [min_work[v], max_work[v]] for the working employees in the subtree of v.

                  How to minimize the total working employees in the children while achieving at least A_u+1?

                  This is a knapsack-like problem? But note: the constraints are large (N up to 500000). However, we can use a greedy? 

                Alternatively, note: we can start by assuming we take the minimal for every child. Then the total is T_min = sum(min_work[v]). Then we need to "upgrade" some children: for a child v, if we set it to a value x (from min_work[v] to max_work[v]), the additional working employees we get is (x - min_work[v]). We want to achieve at least A_u+1 working employees in the children, and we want the minimal total.

                Therefore, we want the smallest total such that the total working employees in the children is at least A_u+1. And for each child, we can choose any value in [min_work[v], max_work[v]]. 

                This is a classic "minimal total with constraint" and we can use greedy: we start with all min_work, and then we choose the children that give the smallest increase per unit? Actually, we can only set a child to a fixed value? 

                But note: we can set a child to any integer in [min_work[v], max_work[v]]. So for a child, we can add up to (max_work[v] - min_work[v]) working employees. And we can add as little as 1 at a time? 

                Actually, we can do: we need to cover a deficit of D = max(0, A_u+1 - T_min). Then we need to choose a set of upgrades (each child can be upgraded arbitrarily in its range) such that the total upgrade is at least D, and the total working employees (which is T_min + upgrade) is minimized? Actually, we want to minimize the total working employees? 

                However, note: we are free to choose the upgrades arbitrarily. And we can add as little as we want to each child? 

                Then the minimal total we can achieve for the children is T_min + D? as long as the total possible upgrade (sum (max_work[v]-min_work[v])) >= D.

                Why? Because we can add exactly D by distributing the D over the children arbitrarily (since we can add at least one to each child without exceeding the max? and we can add fractional? but we need integers). 

                Actually, we can only add integer amounts. But since we are free to distribute D arbitrarily as long as for child v we add at most (max_work[v]-min_work[v]), the minimal total working employees is T_min + D, provided that the total capacity (sum (max_work[v]-min_work[v]) ) >= D.

                But what if the total capacity is less than D? Then we cannot achieve A_u+1? 

                Therefore, for the case that u does not work, we require:

                  T_min + (total capacity) >= A_u+1   ?

                Actually, no: we can only get up to T_min + (total capacity) working employees. So if T_min + (total capacity) < A_u+1, then we cannot achieve at least A_u+1? so this option is not available.

            Therefore:

              Option 1: u works -> total = 1 + T_min (if we choose the minimal for the children) -> but wait, we don't have to choose the minimal for the children? We are minimizing the entire subtree. We can choose the minimal configuration for the children arbitrarily? 

              Actually, when u works, we can choose the children to be in any configuration? and we are minimizing the total. So we would choose the minimal configuration for the children. Then the total is 1 + T_min.

              Option 2: u does not work -> then we require that the children provide at least A_u+1 working employees. The minimal total working employees we can get from the children is:

                  T = max(A_u+1, T_min)   ??? 

                Actually, we can do:

                  Let D = max(0, A_u+1 - T_min)
                  Then we require that D <= (sum_{v}(max_work[v]-min_work[v]))? 

                  Then the minimal total for the children is T_min + D = max(T_min, A_u+1)

                  However, is that achievable? Yes, because we can add D (if D>0) by increasing the working employees in the children by exactly D without exceeding the max_work for any child? 

                  But note: we might not be able to add one unit at a time arbitrarily? Actually, we can choose any integer value for each child in [min_work[v], max_work[v]]. And the sum of the minimal is T_min, and the total capacity is S = sum(max_work[v]-min_work[v]). Then we can achieve any integer between T_min and T_min+S. So if A_u+1 is in [T_min, T_min+S], then we can achieve exactly A_u+1? 

                  But we don't need exactly A_u+1, we need at least A_u+1. The minimal total that is at least A_u+1 is max(T_min, A_u+1). And since we can achieve every integer in [T_min, T_min+S], if A_u+1 <= T_min+S then we can achieve max(T_min, A_u+1) = A_u+1 (if A_u+1>=T_min) or T_min (if A_u+1<=T_min) -> but if A_u+1<=T_min, then we already have at least A_u+1? so we don't need to upgrade.

                  Therefore, the minimal total working employees in the children is max(T_min, A_u+1). 

                  But note: we don't have to stop at A_u+1? we can have more? but we want to minimize the total. So we set the children to have exactly max(T_min, A_u+1) working employees? 

                  However, we can achieve exactly max(T_min, A_u+1) as long as max(T_min, A_u+1) <= T_min + S? which is always true? because if A_u+1 <= T_min, then we use T_min. If A_u+1 > T_min, then we require A_u+1 <= T_min+S? if not, then we cannot achieve at least A_u+1? so this option is not available.

            Therefore, for u:

              min_work[u] = min( 1 + T_min, X ) 
                where X = (if T_min + S >= A_u+1) then max(T_min, A_u+1) else INF)

            However, note: if we cannot achieve the condition for u not to work (i.e., T_min+S < A_u+1), then we don't have the option X? so we only have the option 1+T_min.

          But wait: what if we choose a configuration for the children that is not minimal? We might have a configuration that is in between? 

          Actually, we have considered that for the non-working case we want the minimal total working employees that satisfies the constraint (at least A_u+1). And we argued that the minimal total is max(T_min, A_u+1) provided that A_u+1 <= T_min+S. Otherwise, the constraint is not satisfiable.

     However, note: in the working case, we don't have to use the minimal configuration for the children? We are minimizing the entire subtree. So we would choose the minimal configuration for the children to get 1+T_min.

     Therefore, the recurrence for min_work[u] is:

        Let T_min = sum_{v in children} min_work[v]
        Let S = sum_{v in children} (max_work[v] - min_work[v])

        Then:
          option1 = 1 + T_min   [u works, and we set the children to minimal]
          option2 = 
             if T_min + S >= A_u+1: 
                 X = max(T_min, A_u+1)
             else:
                 X = INF   (meaning impossible for u to not work)

        Then min_work[u] = min(option1, option2)

     Similarly, for max_work[u]?

        We argued: max_work[u] = 1 + T_max, where T_max = sum_{v in children} max_work[v]

        Why? Because we can have u work by putting u before all but at most A_u of the working employees? and we can have all the children at their maximum? 

        However, what if we don't want to have u work? Then we can have the children at their maximum? and then the total is T_max? 

        But then the total working employees in the subtree of u can be as large as max(1+T_max, T_max) = 1+T_max? Actually, no: if we have the children at maximum (T_max) and then u does not work, then the total is T_max. But if u works, we get 1+T_max.

        Therefore, the maximum is 1+T_max? 

        However, we can also choose to have u not work and then we get T_max? which is less than 1+T_max.

        So the maximum is 1+T_max.

        But wait: if we have u work, we get 1+T_max. So that is the maximum.

        Therefore: max_work[u] = 1 + T_max, where T_max = sum_{v in children} max_work[v]

     However, is that always true? 

        Consider: we want to maximize the total. Then we want u to work? because that gives one more. And then we want the children to have as many working employees as possible? and we can arrange the order so that at most A_u working subordinates are present at u's arrival? because we can put u very early (so that only a few working subordinates are present) and then after u arrives, we can have the rest? 

        Therefore, yes.

     Therefore, we can compute:

        min_work[u] = min( 1 + T_min, 
                           (if T_min + S >= A_u+1 then max(T_min, A_u+1) else INF) )

        max_work[u] = 1 + T_max, where T_max = sum_{v in children} max_work[v]

     Then we do a DFS from the leaves to the root.

     At the root, we have min_work[1] and max_work[1]. Then if K is not in [min_work[1], max_work[1]], output -1.

     But note: we are not done: we must also output the permutation.

     How to reconstruct the permutation that gives exactly K working employees?

        We know that at the root, we have two possibilities: either the CEO works or not? 

        Then we traverse the tree and assign a value for each node: the number of working employees in its subtree? 

        Then we need to assign for each child a number in [min_work[v], max_work[v]] such that:

          If the root works: then the total working employees in the children must be K_root - 1, and we must be able to arrange the order so that at most A_1 of the children's working employees are before the root? -> but we can arrange arbitrarily? so we only care about the total? 

          However, wait: the condition for the root: when the root arrives, the working subordinates that have arrived must be <= A_1. But we can arrange the order arbitrarily? so we can put the root at a position such that at most A_1 of the working employees from the entire children are present? 

          Therefore, as long as the total working employees in the children is T, we can always arrange the order so that at most min(A_1, T) are present at the root's arrival? so the root will work? and we need T = K_root - 1.

        But what if the root does not work? Then we require that the total working employees in the children is at least A_1+1? and we want the entire tree to have K_root = T (since the root doesn't work). 

        Then we must assign to the children a total T = K_root that is at least A_1+1 and in the range [min_work_children_total, max_work_children_total]? and also we must have the minimal configuration for the children? 

        However, we have already computed for each node u: 

          min_work[u] and max_work[u]

          and we also know the formula: 

            min_work[u] = min( 1 + T_min, X )   [where X = max(T_min, A_u+1) if T_min+S>=A_u+1, else INF]

            max_work[u] = 1 + T_max

        Now, to reconstruct:

          We do a DFS from the root. For node u, we know the target k_u: the number of working employees in the subtree of u.

          Then:

            Possibility 1: u works -> then k_u = 1 + (sum of working employees in the children). 
                Then we set for the children: the total must be k_u - 1.

            Possibility 2: u does not work -> then k_u = (the total working employees in the children) and we require k_u >= A_u+1 and also k_u must be in the range [T_min, T_min+S] (where T_min = sum(min_work[v]) and S = sum(max_work[v]-min_work[v])).

          How to decide which one? 

            We know k_u. Then:

              If k_u is in the range [min_work[u], max_work[u]]? and we have two possibilities.

            Actually, we can check:

              Option1: if u works, then we require that the children sum to k_u-1, and k_u-1 must be in [T_min, T_max] (where T_min = sum(min_work[v]), T_max = sum(max_work[v])).

              Option2: if u does not work, then we require k_u = k (the total for the children) and k_u must be at least A_u+1 and also k_u in [T_min, T_min+S] (which is the same as [T_min, T_max] because T_min+S = T_max). And also we must have k_u>=A_u+1.

          Therefore, we can check both possibilities? 

          Steps for u:

            Let T_min = sum(min_work[v] for v in children)
            Let T_max = sum(max_work[v] for v in children)

            Possibility1: if u works -> then we require k_u-1 is in [T_min, T_max] and also k_u-1 <= A_u? 
                Wait: the condition for u to work: when u arrives, the working subordinates present must be at most A_u. But note: we can arrange the order arbitrarily so that at most min(k_u-1, A_u) are present? Actually, we can have at most min(k_u-1, A_u) present? 

                However, the condition is: we can arrange the order so that at most A_u working subordinates are present at u's arrival? and we can always do that by putting u early enough? even if k_u-1 is greater than A_u? 

                How? We put u at a position such that only A_u of the working subordinates in the children have arrived? the rest come after. Then u sees A_u and works. 

                Therefore, the condition for u to work is independent of k_u-1? we can always do it? 

                So for the working case, we only require that k_u-1 is in [T_min, T_max].

            Possibility2: if u does not work -> then we require k_u (the total for the children) is in [max(T_min, A_u+1), T_max]? 

          Then:

            if (u can work and k_u-1 is in [T_min, T_max]): 
                then set u to work, and the children must sum to k_u-1.

            else if (u can not work and k_u is in [max(T_min, A_u+1), T_max]): 
                then set u to not work, and the children must sum to k_u.

            else: impossible? 

          But note: we computed min_work[u] and max_work[u] and we know k_u must be in [min_work[u], max_work[u]]. So one of these must hold? 

          However, note: min_work[u] is defined as the minimum of the two options. So if k_u is in the range, one of the two must be chosen.

          Then we traverse the children: we have a total T = (k_u-1) if u works, or T = k_u if u does not work.

          Now, how to assign the T to the children? 

            We need to assign to each child v a value x_v in [min_work[v], max_work[v]] such that sum(x_v) = T.

            This is a classic "exact distribution" in a range. We can do:

              Let L = T_min = sum(min_work[v])
              Let R = T_max = sum(max_work[v])

              Then we know T is in [L, R]. How to assign?

                We can start with the minimal assignment: x_v = min_work[v] for all v.

                Then we need to add D = T - L.

                Then we traverse the children and for each child, we can add up to (max_work[v]-min_work[v]). We add as much as we can (greedily) until D is exhausted? 

                Actually, we can add arbitrarily? we can choose any integer for each child as long as we don't exceed max_work[v]. So we can do:

                  For each child v, we set:

                     add_v = min(D, max_work[v]-min_work[v])
                     x_v = min_work[v] + add_v
                     D -= add_v

                Then if D becomes 0, we are done.

          But note: we know T - L <= R - L = sum(max_work[v]-min_work[v]), so this will work.

          Then for each child v, we set the target for its subtree: k_v = x_v.

        Finally, we need to output the permutation. How?

          We know for each node u:

            - Whether it works or not? Actually, we know the working status: if u works, then we have a constraint: when u arrives, at most A_u of its working subordinates must have arrived? 

          How to generate the arrival order? 

            We can do a DFS that outputs the order? 

            Actually, we can do:

              We know the entire tree and the working status of each node? 

              But note: the working status is determined by the condition at arrival. And we have the targets for the subtrees.

          How to arrange the order? 

            We have the following:

              For a node u, if u works, then we must have at most A_u of the working employees in the entire subtree of u (excluding u) present when u arrives.

            How to achieve that? 

              We can break the subtree of u:

                Let F be the set of working employees in the subtree of u (including u).

                We know that when u arrives, we can have at most A_u working employees (from the children) that are already present.

                Then we can do:

                  Step 1: Output u? but we are going to output the entire subtree. Actually, we are building a permutation of all employees.

                  Alternatively, we can do a DFS that outputs the nodes in the order of arrival. 

                  We can use a recursive procedure:

                    For a node u, and we know the target k_u for the entire subtree.

                    We also know:

                      - Whether u works: then the children must have total T = k_u-1, and we have distributed T to the children: each child v has target k_v.

                    Now, we want to output an order for the entire subtree of u.

                    The constraint: if u works, then at the time u arrives, at most A_u of the working employees in the children must have arrived.

                    How to do?

                      We can output u at a position such that we have not exceeded A_u working employees from the children. 

                      Actually, we can do:

                         First, output the working employees from the children that we want to appear before u? but we are limited to at most A_u? 

                         Then output u.

                         Then output the rest.

                    But note: we also have non-working employees? and they don't count. So we can output any non-working employee arbitrarily? 

                    However, the non-working employees: when they arrive, they don't count toward the condition of u? 

                    Therefore, we can:

                      Step 1: Output all the non-working employees in the subtree of u? 

                      But wait: the condition for u: only working employees that are subordinates count. And non-working employees are subordinates? but they are not working, so they don't count.

                      Therefore, we can output any non-working employee at any time? 

                    How about:

                      We break the subtree of u into:

                         W: the working employees (including u? if u works, then u is working, but note: u hasn't arrived when we are considering the children) -> actually, the working employees in the children.

                         N: the non-working employees.

                    Then we can:

                      - Output all non-working employees arbitrarily? 
                      - But we must be careful: the condition for a non-working employee? Actually, we have already determined the working status for every employee? so we can ignore the condition for non-working employees? because we know they will not work? 

                    However, the condition for a non-working employee j: at the time j arrives, if he sees more than A_j working subordinates, then he doesn't work. But we have set j to be non-working? so we must ensure that at the time j arrives, there are more than A_j working subordinates? 

                    But note: we have set j to be non-working? so we must arrange the order so that at the time j arrives, at least A_j+1 working subordinates have arrived? 

                    Therefore, we cannot arbitrarily put non-working employees? 

          This becomes very complex.

      Alternative approach: 

          We have the entire tree and the working status for every node? Then we can do:

            We traverse the tree in a DFS order? but we must control the arrival of working subordinates for each node.

          Insight: 

            For a node u that works: we must have at most A_u working subordinates arriving before u.

            For a node u that does not work: we must have at least A_u+1 working subordinates arriving before u.

          How to build the permutation? 

            We can use a DFS that, for a node u, does:

              We know the list of children and their subtrees. And we know the working status of u and the working status of each child? Actually, we don't know the working status of each child? we only know the total working employees in each child's subtree? 

          Actually, we have computed the target for each child? we know k_v for each child v (the total working employees in the subtree of v). And we know the working status of u? 

          But note: the working status of the children themselves is determined? 

          How about we do:

            We know for each child v: we have a subtree and we know the entire set of working employees in that subtree. And we know the condition for u: 

              if u works: at u's arrival, at most A_u working employees (from the entire set of working employees in the children) have arrived.

              if u does not work: at u's arrival, at least A_u+1 working employees have arrived.

          How to interleave the children? 

            We can break the children into two sets:

              Set A: children that have at least one working employee? 

            But note: the condition is about the working employees (anywhere in the subtree) that are present? 

          Actually, we can consider: 

            For a child v, the entire subtree of v can be arranged arbitrarily? and we know the working status of every node in that subtree? 

            However, we want to control the number of working employees that appear before u.

            We can do:

              For each child v, we can choose to output some of the working employees in the subtree of v? but we don't have control over the internal order? 

          Actually, we can recursively build the order for each subtree. Then we merge the orders.

          We are going to design a recursive function:

            def dfs(u, k_u): 
               returns a permutation of the nodes in the subtree of u that achieves k_u working employees.

          Steps:

            Precomputation for u:

              We have the children and for each child v, we know min_work[v], max_work[v] and we have distributed k_v.

            Then:

              We decide if u works or not: 

                if u works: 
                   total_children_work = k_u - 1
                else:
                   total_children_work = k_u

              Then we assign to each child v a value k_v in [min_work[v], max_work[v]] such that the sum is total_children_work.

              Then we want to build the order for the entire subtree.

            How to combine?

              We will combine the orders of the children and then insert u at a specific position.

              Condition for u:

                Let W = the set of working employees in the entire children (which we know: total_children_work).

                However, we don't have the list of working employees? but we can compute the condition by the children.

              For u:

                if u works: we require that at the time u arrives, at most A_u working employees (from the entire children) have arrived.

                if u does not work: we require at least A_u+1.

            How to achieve? 

              We can output the children's orders in an interleaved way? 

              But note: we can choose the order arbitrarily? so we can decide the order of the children and the insertion of u.

              We can do:

                We break the children's subtrees: each subtree v has a set of working employees. 

                We can output a prefix of working employees (from the entire children) of length at most A_u (if u works) or at least A_u+1 (if u does not work).

                However, we cannot break the subtree arbitrarily? the subtree must be output as a contiguous block? 

              Actually, no: we can interleave arbitrarily the nodes from different subtrees.

            How about:

              Step 1: We will generate the entire list for the subtree of u by merging the children's orders arbitrarily? 

              But we must also insert u at a specific position.

            Alternatively, we can do:

              We can output u at a time when the number of working employees that have arrived is exactly a value we choose? 

              However, we can control the exposure of working employees by releasing them one by one.

            We can use a greedy:

              We want to output the entire subtree of u (without u) and then insert u at a position that satisfies the condition? 

              But we can insert u anywhere? 

              Let F = the total working employees in the children.

              Then if we put u at position i (meaning that the first i employees are from the children, then u), then the condition is:

                 if u works: the number of working employees in the first i positions must be <= A_u.
                 if u does not work: the number of working employees in the first i positions must be >= A_u+1.

              But note: we can arrange the children arbitrarily? so we can choose the first i positions to have as many working employees as we want? but we cannot change the working status? 

              Actually, we can choose which working employees to put in the prefix? 

              How? We can choose the order arbitrarily? so we can put up to F working employees in the prefix? and we can also put as few as 0? 

              Therefore, the condition for u works:

                 We can choose an i such that the prefix (the first i) has at most A_u working employees? and then we put u at position i+1.

                 But note: we can always choose the prefix to have min(F, A_u) working employees? Actually, we can choose the prefix to have any number between 0 and F? 

                 Therefore, we can always satisfy the condition for u to work: by putting u at a position such that the prefix has at most A_u working employees? and we can choose the prefix to have at most A_u? 

                 How? We put at most A_u working employees in the prefix? and the rest after u.

              Similarly, for u not working: we can put at least A_u+1 working employees in the prefix? and then u at the next position.

            But wait: we also have non-working employees? and we can put non-working employees arbitrarily? 

            Actually, we can put non-working employees anywhere? they don't count? 

            Therefore, we can:

              We want to put u at a position such that the number of working employees in the prefix is:

                 if u works: at most A_u -> we can choose the prefix to have exactly min(F, A_u) working employees? 

                 if u does not work: at least A_u+1 -> we can choose the prefix to have exactly min(F, A_u+1) or more? 

              However, note: we can put non-working employees in the prefix arbitrarily? and they do not count. So the only constraint is that we must have at least A_u+1 working employees in the prefix? we can do that only if F >= A_u+1? which we have because in the non-working case we required k_u (which is F) >= A_u+1.

            Therefore, the plan:

              We want to generate an order for the entire subtree of u (without u) that is a permutation of all nodes in the subtree except u? and then we insert u at a position such that the prefix has:

                 if u works: exactly min(F, A_u) working employees? -> but wait: we can have any number from 0 to F? so we can choose to have exactly min(F, A_u) in the prefix? 

                 However, we don't need exactly min(F, A_u): we only require at most A_u? so we can choose to have any number <= min(F, A_u). Actually, we can choose to have exactly min(F, A_u) in the prefix? 

              But note: we can also put fewer? but then we could put more working employees in the prefix? but why would we? 

              Actually, we can do:

                 We will output:

                    Part 1: a set of working employees? we choose min(F, A_u) working employees (if u works) or A_u+1 working employees (if u does not work) to be in the prefix.

                    Part 2: u

                    Part 3: the rest.

              How to choose which working employees to put in the prefix? 

                 We can choose any min(F, A_u) working employees? 

              But note: the working employees are in different subtrees? and we must output the entire subtree? 

              Actually, we are going to build the entire subtree order recursively? 

            Proposed method for combining:

              We have the children: each child v has a subtree that we can generate an order for? and we know that the order for the subtree of v is an arbitrary permutation? 

              We can break the subtree of v into two parts:

                 We want to extract a prefix of the subtree of v that contains a given number of working employees? 

              However, we cannot break the recursive generation arbitrarily? 

          Alternative: we use a greedy interleaving. We will simulate the release of working employees.

          Steps for u:

            We are going to generate the order for the entire subtree of u.

            We have a list of children, each child v has a target k_v and we have generated an order for the subtree of v? 

            We also know that we can break the subtree of v arbitrarily: we can take a prefix of the order for v that contains any number of working employees from 0 to k_v? 

            Actually, no: the order for the subtree of v is fixed? we cannot break it arbitrarily? 

          Therefore, we need to design the recursive function so that we can extract a prefix of the subtree of v that has a given number of working employees? 

          How? 

            We can use a technique: for a subtree, we output the working employees as late as possible? or as early as possible? 

          Actually, we can design two orders:

             One that minimizes the number of working employees in the prefix for any length? 
             One that maximizes.

          But we don't need both? we need to be able to extract a prefix of the subtree of v that contains a given number of working employees? 

          How about we do:

            For the entire subtree of v, we can generate an order that has the property that the working employees appear as late as possible? then the prefix of any length has the minimal possible working employees.

            Or as early as possible.

          However, we can also use a more flexible method:

            We can generate the order for a subtree arbitrarily? but we also precompute the positions of the working employees? 

          Given the complexity and constraints (N up to 500000), we need an efficient method.

      Insight: we can use a DFS that outputs the entire subtree as a list? but that would be O(n^2) in time and memory.

      Instead, we can use a DSU-like merging of lists? but the constraints are large.

      Alternatively, we can avoid building the list explicitly? 

      We note: the condition for u only cares about the cumulative count of working employees in the entire subtree of the children.

      We can do:

        Let the entire set of nodes in the subtree of u (excluding u) be the union of the children's subtrees.

        We want to assign an arrival time to each node? 

        The constraint: 

          For u: 
            if u works: the number of working employees that arrive before u must be <= A_u.
            if u does not work: >= A_u+1.

          And for any other node v in the subtree, the condition: 
            when v arrives, the number of working employees that are subordinates of v and have arrived so far must be <= A_v (if v works) or > A_v (if v does not work).

        How to satisfy all?

      Given the complexity, note: the sample input 1: 
        "5 3
         3 2 1 2 2 
         1 2 2 1"

        Output: -1

      How do our min_work and max_work compute for sample input 1?

        Build tree:

          Employee 1: children [2,5]? 
          Employee 2: children [3,4]
          Employee 3: leaf
          Employee 4: leaf
          Employee 5: leaf

        A = [3,2,1,2,2]  (index0: employee1, ...)

        Leaves: 3,4,5 -> min_work = max_work = 1.

        Employee 2: 
          T_min = min_work[3] + min_work[4] = 1+1 = 2
          S = (max_work[3]-min_work[3]) + (max_work[4]-min_work[4]) = 0+0=0
          Then:
            option1: 1 + T_min = 3
            option2: if T_min+S >= A_2+1 -> 2+0 >= 2+1? 2>=3? false -> so not available.
          So min_work[2]=3
          max_work[2]=1 + (max_work[3]+max_work[4]) = 1+2 = 3

        Employee 5: leaf -> min_work[5]=1, max_work[5]=1.

        Employee 1:
          T_min = min_work[2] + min_work[5] = 3+1 = 4
          S = (3-3) + (1-1) = 0
          Then:
            option1: 1 + T_min = 5
            option2: T_min+S>= A_1+1? 4+0>=3+1 -> 4>=4 -> true -> X = max(4,4)=4
          So min_work[1] = min(5,4)=4
          max_work[1] = 1 + (max_work[2]+max_work[5]) = 1+ (3+1)=5

        Then K=3 is not in [4,5]? so we output -1.

        But the sample output is -1.

      Therefore, our min_work and max_work computation is correct.

      Now, we must generate the permutation for the second sample.

        Input: 
          7 5
          4 2 0 0 3 0 1 
          1 2 1 2 2 3 

        Build tree:

          Employee 1: children: 2, 3? 
          Employee 2: children: 4,5,6? 
          Employee 3: no child? 
          Employee 4: no child?
          Employee 5: child: 7?
          Employee 6: no child?
          Employee 7: no child?

        But the input: B2=1, B3=2, B4=1, B5=2, B6=2, B7=3 -> wait, employee 7: B7=3? but employee 3 is the direct superior? 

        Correction: the input: 
          B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7: 
            B2=1 (for employee2)
            B3=2 (for employee3) -> wait, the problem says: for i from 2 to N: B_i
            So for employee2: B2=1 -> parent=1
            employee3: B3=2 -> parent=2? 
            employee4: B4=1 -> parent=1
            employee5: B5=2 -> parent=2
            employee6: B6=2 -> parent=2
            employee7: B7=3 -> parent=3

        So tree:

          1: children: 2,4
          2: children: 3,5,6
          3: children: 7
          4: leaf
          5: leaf? -> no, because 7 has parent 3, so 3 has child 7.
          6: leaf
          7: leaf

        Actually, employee5: no child? 
        But the input: B7=3 -> so employee7 has parent 3.

        Now, compute min_work and max_work:

          Leaves: 4,5,6,7: min_work=1, max_work=1.

          Employee 3: 
             children: [7]
             T_min = 1, S=0.
             min_work[3] = min(1+1, if 1+0>=0+1? 1>=1 -> true then X = max(1,1)=1) -> min(2,1)=1.
             max_work[3] = 1+1 = 2.

          Employee 2: 
             children: [3,5,6] -> min_work: [1,1,1] -> T_min=3, S = (2-1)+(1-1)+(1-1)=1+0+0=1.
             min_work[2] = min(1+3, if 3+1>=2+1? 4>=3 -> true -> X = max(3,3)=3) = min(4,3)=3.
             max_work[2] = 1 + (2+1+1)=5.

          Employee 1:
             children: [2,4] -> min_work: [3,1] -> T_min=4, S=(5-3)+(1-1)=2+0=2.
             min_work[1] = min(1+4, if 4+2>=4+1? 6>=5 -> true -> X = max(4,5)=5) = min(5,5)=5.
             max_work[1] = 1 + (5+1)=7.

          Then K=5 is in [5,7]. So we can achieve.

          Now, we reconstruct the targets:

            Root (employee1) has k1=5.

            Possibilities:

              Option1: works -> then children total = 4.
              Option2: does not work -> then children total =5, and must be>=5 (since A_1+1=5) and we have T_min=4 and T_max=6 (for the children: 2 and 4: min_work[2]=3, min_work[4]=1, max_work[2]=5, max_work[4]=1, so T_min=4, T_max=6). And 5 is in [4,6] and >=5 -> valid.

            How to choose? 

              We try to choose the one that is easier? 

            Actually, we can check both:

              Option1: u (1) works -> then the children must sum to 4.

                 How to distribute 4 to the children [2,4]? 
                    x2 in [3,5], x4 in [1,1] -> so x4 must be 1.
                    then x2 = 3.

              Option2: u does not work -> then children must sum to 5.
                    x2 in [3,5], x4=1 -> so x2=4? (since 3+1=4, then we need 5, so x2=4) -> but 4 is in [3,5]? yes.

            How to decide? 

              We can choose either? 

            But note: the sample output is: 7 3 6 5 2 1 4

            In this output, employee1 is at the 6th position -> then when 1 arrives, the number of working subordinates that have arrived? 

            How many working employees are in the children? 

              We need to know the working status of every employee? 

            How does the sample output work? 

              Order: 7,3,6,5,2,1,4

              We determine working status:

                employee7: arrives first -> has no subordinate? -> works? (0<=A_7=1) -> works.
                employee3: arrives second? 
                   subordinates: employee7? has arrived? and is working -> count=1. A_3=0? -> 1>0 -> does not work.
                employee6: arrives third? 
                   has no subordinate? -> works? -> count=0<=A_6=0? -> works? (0<=0) -> works.
                employee5: arrives fourth? 
                   no subordinate? -> works? -> 0<=A_5=3 -> works.
                employee2: arrives fifth?
                   subordinates: employee3,5,6,7? 
                      but only those that have arrived and are working: 
                         employee3: arrived but not working -> doesn't count.
                         employee5: arrived and working -> count=1
                         employee6: arrived and working -> count=2
                         employee7: arrived and working? but employee7 is in the subtree of 3? and 3 is a child of 2? 
                         However, the condition: only direct and indirect subordinates? and at the time of 2, who has arrived? 7,3,6,5.

                   The working ones: 7 (subordinate of 3, but 3 is not working, but 7 is a subordinate of 2? because 2->3->7? so 7 is a subordinate of 2? 
                   How many working employees that are subordinates of 2 have arrived? 
                         employee5: works -> direct? 
                         employee6: works -> direct?
                         employee7: works? but is under 3? and 3 is a child of 2? -> so yes.

                   Therefore, count = 3? 
                   Then condition: 3<=A_2=2? -> no, so employee2 does not work.

                employee1: arrives sixth?
                   subordinates: all others? 
                         working: 7,6,5 -> count=3? 
                   condition: 3<=A_1=4? -> works.

                employee4: arrives last? 
                   no subordinate? -> works? -> condition: 0<=A_4=0 -> works.

                Total working: 7,6,5,1,4 -> 5.

            Now, in this scenario, the root (1) works? so in our reconstruction we would have chosen option1 for the root? then the children must have total 4 working employees.

            But here, the children of 1 are 2 and 4? 
               4: works -> 1
               2: does not work? but the subtree of 2: 
                 employees: 2,3,5,6,7 -> working: 5,6,7? -> 3? 
               total working in children of 1: 1 (from 4) + 3 (from 2) = 4 -> matches.

            So we choose for the root: option1 (works) and the children total=4.

            Then for child 2: we assign k2=3? 
               Then in the subtree of 2: 
                 Possibilities for 2: 
                    T_min = min_work[3]+min_work[5]+min_work[6] = 1+1+1=3? 
                    S = (2-1)+(1-1)+(1-1)=1
                    min_work[2]=3, max_work[2]=5.

                 k2=3.

                 Possibilities:
                    works: then children total = 2? 
                    not works: then children total=3, and must be>=3 (A_2+1=3) -> and 3 in [3, 3+1]? and 3>=3 -> valid.

                 How to distribute for the children of 2: 
                    If works: then children total=2? 
                         But the children: [3,5,6] -> each has min_work=1? so minimal sum=3, cannot be 2 -> not possible.
                    So must be not work: then children total=3.

                 Then for each child: 
                    3: k3 in [1,2] -> we choose?
                    5: k5=1 (leaf)
                    6: k6=1 (leaf)

                 How to distribute 3? 
                    k3 + k5 + k6 = 3 -> k3=1? then 1+1+1=3.

                 So k3=1.

            Then for employee3: 
                 k3=1.
                 Possibilities:
                    works: then children total=0? 
                    not works: then children total=1, and must be>=1 (A_3+1=1) -> valid.

                 But if we choose works: then children total=0? 
                    But the child 7 must have k7=1? so we cannot have 0? 
                 So must be not work: then children total=1.

                 Then for child 7: k7=1 (leaf).

            Now, we generate the order:

              We start from the root.

              Root 1: works, so we need to put at most A_1=4 working employees before 1? actually, we can put up to 4, but we have total working employees in the children=4? we can put them all after 1? but then at 1's arrival, 0 working subordinates? but then 1 works. However, we also have to include 1 itself.

              The sample output: 7,3,6,5,2,1,4

              How to build:

                For node 1: 
                  We have two children: 2 and 4? but also the entire subtree? 

                Actually, we have the entire tree. 

              How to build the order for the children of 1? 

                We need to generate the order for the entire subtree of 1 without 1? 

                The working employees in the children: 4,5,6,7 and also 4? 

                We need to satisfy the conditions for every node.

                For node 1: we can put at most 4 working employees before 1? but we have 4 working employees in the children? and we also have non-working employees: 2,3? 

                We want to have 1 appear at a position such that the number of working employees that are subordinates of 1 and have arrived is at most 4? which is always true? 

                But note: we can put 1 at the very end? then the prefix would have all 4 working employees? which is <=4 -> works.

                However, we also have to consider the conditions for the other nodes.

                The sample output put 1 at position 6.

              How to build the order for the children? 

                We have two children: 2 and 4? but 4 is a leaf? and 2 has a big subtree.

                Actually, the subtree of 1: includes 1,2,3,4,5,6,7.

              We break the subtree of 1: we know the working status of every node? 
                 working: 1,4,5,6,7 -> but 1 is the root and we are building the order without 1? 
                 non-working: 2,3.

              Now, we need to arrange the other nodes such that:

                 For node 2: we require that at its arrival, at least 3 working employees (that are subordinates) are present? 
                    But the only working employees that are subordinates of 2 are: 3? no, wait: 2's subordinates: 3,5,6,7. Working: 5,6,7? 
                 So at 2's arrival, we need at least 3 working employees (from {5,6,7}) present? 

                 How can we achieve that? 
                    We must have 5,6,7 arrived before 2.

                 Similarly, for node 3: 
                    Condition: non-working, so we require at least 1 working employee (that is subordinate) present at 3's arrival? 
                    The subordinates of 3: 7? 
                    So we require 7 to arrive before 3.

              Therefore, constraints:

                7 must arrive before 3? 
                5,6,7 must arrive before 2.

              The sample order: 7,3,6,5,2,1,4

                7 arrives first -> satisfies the condition for 3 (7 is before 3) and for 2 (7 is before 2).
                3 arrives second: condition -> at the time, 7 has arrived and is working? so count=1>=1 -> works? no, 3 is non-working? and condition: at least 1 working subordinate? yes -> so condition satisfied.

                6 arrives: works? 
                5 arrives: works?
                2 arrives: at that time, working subordinates: 7,6,5 -> count=3 -> condition: 3>2 (A_2=2) -> so 2 does not work -> condition satisfied.

                1 arrives: working subordinates: 7,6,5 -> count=3<=4 -> works.
                4 arrives: works.

              How to generate such an order? 

                We can do a DFS from the root downward? and for each node, we have the constraints from the children.

                We can use a BFS? 

                Alternatively, we can use a topological sort? 

                But note: we have constraints only for non-working nodes: they require that a certain number of working employees in their subtree have arrived before them.

                Specifically, for a non-working node u, we require that at least A_u+1 working employees that are in the subtree of u have arrived before u.

                For a working node u, we require that at most A_u working employees in the subtree of u have arrived before u.

                How to schedule? 

                  We can schedule a node u only after we have scheduled at least A_u+1 working employees in its subtree (if u is non-working) or we can schedule u at any time as long as we don't have more than A_u working employees in its subtree scheduled (if u is working).

                But the constraints are: the working employees in the subtree of u might depend on u's descendants.

                We can do a topological sort from leaves upward? 

                  We want to start from the leaves and move upward.

                We can use a priority queue? 

                However, we have to also consider the condition for non-working nodes: they require a minimum number of working employees to be scheduled before them.

                We can do:

                  We maintain:

                    available: a set of nodes that have no unscheduled children? 

                  But note: the condition is not about the children being scheduled? but about the working employees in the entire subtree.

                We can precompute the entire set of working employees in the subtree of u? 

                And then for a non-working node u, we require that at least A_u+1 of them are scheduled before we can schedule u.

                For a working node u, we can schedule u at any time? but we must ensure that at the time we schedule u, the number of scheduled working employees in the subtree of u is at most A_u.

                But note: after scheduling u, we can schedule more working employees in the subtree? but they come after, so they don't affect u.

                Therefore, for a working node u, we can schedule u as long as the number of working employees in the subtree that have been scheduled so far is at most A_u.

                And once we schedule u, then we have one more working employee? 

                How to do? 

                  We can use a DFS that collects the entire subtree? 

                  Given the constraints, we need an efficient method.

          Given the complexity, and since N is up to 500000, we need a linear or near-linear method.

      However, note: the reconstruction of the permutation is known to be possible by the min_work and max_work computation? and the distribution to children. 

      We can generate the permutation as follows:

        We will use a DFS that returns a list of events? but that would be O(n^2) in memory.

      Alternatively, we can output the permutation iteratively.

      Insight: we can schedule the nodes in increasing order of the depth? or in a specific order.

      Proposed method:

        We will use a queue (or a stack) and schedule nodes that are ready: 

          A node u is ready if and only if:

             For the entire subtree of u, we have scheduled enough working employees to satisfy the condition for u? 

          Specifically:

             If u is working: then we can schedule u at any time as long as the number of working employees in the subtree of u that have been scheduled is at most A_u. But note: we haven't scheduled any working employee in the subtree of u? because we haven't scheduled any child's subtree? 

          This seems not trivial.

      Given the time, and since the problem is non-trivial, we might output the permutation in the following way:

        We know the working status for every node.

        Then we can do:

          For each node u, we know the minimal number of working employees that must be scheduled before u (if u is non-working, then at least A_u+1; if u is working, then no constraint other than at most A_u).

          We also know the entire set of working employees.

        Then we can use a method similar to scheduling with constraints: 

          We schedule the nodes in reverse order? 

        But the condition for u: it depends on the working employees in the subtree that are scheduled before u.

        How about we schedule all working employees first? 

          Then for a non-working node u, we require that at least A_u+1 working employees in the subtree of u have been scheduled before u? but if we schedule all working employees first, then for a non-working node u, the entire working employees in the subtree are scheduled before u? and if the total working employees in the subtree of u is T, then we require T>=A_u+1.

        But is that true for the sample? 
          non-working nodes: 2 and 3.
          For 3: T=1 (only 7) -> requires 1>=1 -> holds.
          For 2: T=3 (5,6,7) -> requires 3>=3 -> holds.

        Then we can schedule:

          First, schedule all working employees: 4,5,6,7,1? but wait, 1 is working, but 1 is the root? and 1's condition: at most 4 working employees before it? if we put 1 after the 4 working employees (4,5,6,7) then at 1's arrival, there are 4 working employees -> works.

          Then schedule the non-working employees: 2,3.

          But the sample output: 7,3,6,5,2,1,4

          This method would give: a permutation that is: [working employees in any order] then [non-working employees in any order] then 1? 

          But we also have to include 1 in the working employees? and then we put 1 at the end? 

          Proposed order: 
             Working employees: 4,5,6,7,1 -> but note: 1 is the root and must be scheduled? 
             Non-working: 2,3.

          But then the order might be: 4,5,6,7,1,2,3 -> or any order of the working employees.

          However, we have the constraint for the non-working employees: 
             employee3: must have at least 1 working employee in its subtree scheduled before it? 
                subtree of 3: 7? 
             employee2: must have at least 3 working employees in its subtree scheduled before it? 
                subtree of 2: 5,6,7? 

          If we schedule the working employees in the order: 4,5,6,7, then employee3 is scheduled after, and at the time of employee3, the working employee 7 has been scheduled? -> condition for 3: met.

          employee2: scheduled after all working employees? then at its arrival, 5,6,7 have been scheduled -> count=3, condition met.

          Then we schedule 2,3 in any order? and then 1 at the end? 

          But 1 must be scheduled. In our list: we have scheduled 4,5,6,7, then 2,3, then 1.

          Then the entire permutation: 4,5,6,7,2,3,1 -> 
             Let's check 1: at the time of 1, the working employees: 4,5,6,7 are present? count=4<=4 -> works.

          But is this order valid for everyone? 
             employee4: first -> works.
             employee5: works.
             employee6: works.
             employee7: works.
             employee2: 
                when arrives: working employees in its subtree that have arrived: 5,6,7? count=3>2 -> doesn't work -> as expected.
             employee3: 
                when arrives: working employees in its subtree: 7 has arrived? count=1>0 -> doesn't work.
             employee1: works.

          Total working: 4,5,6,7,1 -> 5, which is K=5.

          But the sample output is: 7,3,6,5,2,1,4.

          There are multiple solutions.

          How to generate the working employees in an order that satisfies the constraints for the non-working employees? 

          Specifically, for a non-working node u, we only care that at least A_u+1 working employees in the subtree of u are scheduled before u. 

          We can schedule the working employees arbitrarily? as long as for each non-working node u, the working employees in the subtree of u appear before u.

          Therefore, for each non-working node u, we require that every working employee in the subtree of u must be scheduled before u.

          Additionally, for a working node u, we only require that at most A_u working employees in the subtree of u are scheduled before u? but note: we are scheduling all working employees first? then all non-working? then finally the working node u might be scheduled in the working part? then it is scheduled before any non-working? and the condition: the working employees in the subtree of u that are scheduled before u might be some of them? 

          However, in the working part, we have scheduled all working employees arbitrarily? so for a working node u, the number of working employees in its subtree that are scheduled before u is exactly the number of working employees in the subtree of u that are scheduled before u in the working part. 

          But we can control the order of the working employees arbitrarily? so for a working node u, we can put u early enough in the working part so that not too many working employees in its subtree are before it.

          Specifically, for a working node u, let F = total working employees in the subtree of u (including u). Then we can put u as one of the first (A_u+1) employees in the working part of the subtree of u? 

          How? 

            We can use a DFS within the working employees: 

              For a working node u, 
                 we schedule u as soon as we have scheduled at most A_u working employees in the subtree of u.

            This is similar to the original condition.

          Given the complexity, we might do:

            Within the set of working employees, we do a DFS that for a working node u, we

              - First schedule up to A_u working employees from the subtree of u (excluding u) that are working, in any order? 
              - Then schedule u.
              - Then schedule the rest of the working employees in the subtree of u.

          This DFS order would ensure that when u is scheduled, at most A_u working employees in the subtree of u have been scheduled.

          Then after scheduling all working employees (in this DFS order), we schedule the non-working employees in any order? as long as for a non-working employee u, all working employees in the subtree of u have been scheduled.

          And finally schedule the root? 

          But wait: the root is a working employee? so it is scheduled in the working part.

          Then the entire permutation is: 
              [working employees scheduled by a DFS that for each working node u: 
                 schedule up to A_u working employees from its subtree (working ones), then u, then the rest] 
              then [non-working employees in any order]

          However, the root is the last to be scheduled in the working part? 

          But note: the condition for the root: 
             at the time of the root, the working employees in its subtree that have been scheduled should be at most A_root.

          In the DFS order, when we schedule the root, we would have scheduled up to A_root working employees from its subtree (children) before it? 

          How? 

            For the root (which is working), in the DFS procedure:

              We will schedule some working employees from the children (at most A_root), then the root, then the rest.

          Therefore, the condition for the root is satisfied.

          And for any other working node u, we have scheduled at most A_u working employees in the subtree before u.

          For non-working employees, we schedule them after the entire working part, so they see all working employees in their subtree? so the condition for a non-working employee u: we have scheduled at least A_u+1 working employees in the subtree of u? because we scheduled them all? and the total working employees in the subtree of u is at least A_u+1 (which is the condition we used to assign the non-working status).

          Therefore, this works.

          Steps for generating the permutation:

            Step 1: Traverse the tree to assign working status and distribute the k values to children? 

            Step 2: For each node, we know if it is working or not.

            Step 3: We do a DFS for the working employees to generate the order for the working part:

                def dfs_work(u):
                  # We want to generate the order for the working employees in the subtree of u, and u is working.
                  Let children_work = list of working employees in the direct children's subtrees? but note: not direct children, we need to consider the entire subtree.

                  Actually, we can do:

                     For each child v of u, we have a set of working employees in the subtree of v? but we don't know if v is working or not? 

                  Instead, we can do:

                     We know the working status of every node. So for the subtree of u, we only consider the working employees.

                     But note: the condition: we can schedule at most A_u working employees in the subtree of u (excluding u) before u.

                     How to do recursively:

                        We maintain a list for the working employees in the subtree of u.

                        We iterate over the children: for each child v, we can get the list of working employees in the subtree of v? and then we can interleave them arbitrarily? 

                     However, we can use a greedy: 

                        We are allowed to schedule up to A_u working employees (from the subtree of u, excluding u) before u.

                        We can take min(A_u, F) working employees from the entire subtree (distributed arbitrarily) and schedule them, then schedule u, then schedule the remaining working employees.

                        But how to choose which ones? 

                     Alternatively, we can use a priority queue? 

                  Given the constraints, we can do:

                     We will schedule working employees in the subtree of u (excluding u) in an arbitrary order until we have scheduled A_u of them, then schedule u, then schedule the rest.

                  But is that sufficient? 

                     For a working employee w in the subtree, the condition: we require that when w is scheduled, at most A_w working employees in the subtree of w are scheduled before w.

                  How to ensure that for every working employee in the subtree? 

                     We can do a DFS that does the same recursively for each child.

                  Therefore, the recursive function for a working node u:

                     result = []
                     # We are going to schedule working employees in the subtree of u: first up to A_u from the entire subtree (but note: we also have to ensure the condition for the children)

                     # Instead, we do recursively for each child subtree: but we cannot exceed A_u for the entire subtree.

                  Alternatively, we can do independently for each child? 

                  We can schedule the working employees in the subtree of u in an order that is the concatenation of the orders for the children? but we insert u in the middle.

                  Specifically:

                     We will gather from each child subtree a list of working employees. We can break the list from a child into two parts: a prefix and a suffix. 
                     We can take an arbitrary number from the prefix of each child.

                  Given the complexity, we might do:

                     Let limit = A_u   # the maximum number of working employees (excluding u) we can put before u.
                     We initialize an empty list for the working employees in the subtree of u.

                     For each child v (whether v is working or not? we only care about the working employees in the subtree of v), we can get the list of working employees in the subtree of v by calling dfs_work on v? but only if v is working? 

                     But note: v might be non-working, then the working employees in the subtree of v are generated by the children of v? and we can still call a function that returns the list of working employees in the subtree of v.

                  However, we design a function that for any node (whether working or not) returns the list of working employees in the subtree of that node? 

                  But for a non-working node, we don't have a DFS_work for it? 

                  Instead, we can do:

                     We do not recursively enter non-working nodes in dfs_work? we only consider working nodes. For a non-working node, its subtree of working employees can be generated by iterating over the working employees in its subtree, but not including itself.

                  We can precompute the list of working employees in the subtree of every node? 

                  Given the constraints, we avoid materializing the list (because it would be O(n^2)).

          Given the time, we might do:

             We simulate the scheduling for the working employees using a BFS from the leaves upward? 

          Instead, we can do:

             We maintain for each node u (working or not) the list of working employees in the subtree of u? as a collections.deque for efficiency in concatenation.

          But the total might be O(n^2).

      Given the complexity and constraints, we must avoid materializing the list.

      Alternative for the working part: 

          We know that for a working node u, we can schedule u only after we have scheduled at most A_u working employees in its subtree. 

          We can use a priority queue: we put leaves in a queue. Then when we schedule a working node, we require that its children have been scheduled? 

          But the condition is not about children but about the entire subtree.

      Another idea: we can schedule in the working part in increasing order of depth? 

          For a working node u, the working employees in its subtree have greater depth? 

          Then if we schedule by increasing depth, then when we schedule u, we have not scheduled any working employee in the subtree of u? because they are deeper. 

          Then the condition: 0<=A_u -> always works.

          But then for a working node u, we would have scheduled 0 working employees in its subtree before it? which is <= A_u.

          But is that enough? 

          Consider: 
             node u is at depth d, and its working subordinate v is at depth d+1. 
             If we schedule by increasing depth, then u is scheduled before v? so when u is scheduled, v has not been scheduled? so the count is 0.

          However, what if we have a working employee w in the subtree of u that is at the same depth? 

          By the tree structure, depth is unique? because each node has one parent.

          Therefore, scheduling by increasing depth: 
             all working employees will be scheduled in an order of increasing depth.

          Then for a working node u at depth d, when it is scheduled, no working employee in the subtree of u (which must be at depth > d) has been scheduled? so the count is 0.

          For a non-working node: we schedule them after the working part? so they see all working employees in their subtree.

          Therefore, we can generate the working part by:

             Group working employees by depth, then from depth 0 to max, output all working employees at that depth in any order.

          But depth: the CEO (employee1) is at depth 0? 
             Then if we output employee1 at depth0, but employee1 has working employees in the subtree at depth1, then when employee1 is scheduled, the count is 0? works.

          However, the sample output: employee1 is not scheduled first? 

          But note: employee1 is scheduled at the end of the working part? 

          In the working part, we output by increasing depth: 
             depth0: [1]? 
             depth1: working employees at depth1: employee4? 
             depth2: employee5,6,7? 
          Then the order: 1,4,5,6,7 -> but then employee1 is first? and when 1 arrives, the count is 0? works.

          But then non-working part: 2,3.

          Total order: 1,4,5,6,7,2,3.

          Check employee2: 
             arrives after all working employees? 
             working employees in its subtree: 5,6,7 -> all scheduled before? count=3>2 -> doesn't work.
          employee3: 
             working employees in its subtree: 7 -> scheduled before? count=1>0 -> doesn't work.

          This satisfies.

          But is it valid for the entire tree? 

          The problem: 
             employee1: works? 
             employee4: works? 
             employee5: works? 
             employee6: works? 
             employee7: works? 
             -> working employees: 1,4,5,6,7 -> 5.

          However, in the sample output, the order is 7,3,6,5,2,1,4.

          Why is 3 scheduled before 5 and 6? 

          But our method by depth: 
             employee3: non-working, scheduled at the end.

          There are multiple valid orders.

          Therefore, we can generate the permutation as follows:

            Step 1: Compute depth for every node (BFS from the root).

            Step 2: Mark the working status for every node (using the distribution procedure described).

            Step 3: 
                Part1: working employees sorted by depth (and within the same depth, any order) 
                Part2: non-working employees in any order.

            Then output: Part1, then Part2.

          But wait: the condition for a working node u: if we output by increasing depth, then when a working node u is output, all working employees in the subtree of u are at greater depth, so not scheduled yet? -> condition: 0<=A_u -> works.

          For a non-working node u: scheduled after all working employees? then all working employees in the subtree of u are scheduled before u? and we know that for non-working node u, the total working employees in the subtree of u is at least A_u+1 -> condition: at least A_u+1 working employees present -> works.

          Therefore, this is valid.

          However, the sample input 1: 
            5 3
            A = [3,2,1,2,2]
            B = [1,2,2,1]   (for employees2 to 5)

          We determined that K=3 is impossible? so we output -1.

          For the sample input 2, we output the working part by increasing depth and then non-working.

          What about the CEO? it is at depth0, so in the working part it is scheduled first? 

          But the sample output scheduled the CEO at position 6.

          Why is it valid to schedule the CEO first? 
             When the CEO is scheduled, there are 0 working employees in the subtree? -> works.

          So our method might output:

             Working employees: 
                depth0: [1]
                depth1: [2,4]  -> but employee2 is non-working? so not included. 
                depth2: [3,5] -> but employee3 is non-working? 
                Actually, working employees: 
                  employee1: works? 
                  employee4: works? 
                  employee5: works? 
                  employee6: works? 
                  employee7: works? 

                But in the tree of sample2:

                  depth0: 1
                  depth1: 2,4
                  depth2: 3,5,6,7?   -> but wait: 
                    1: depth0
                    2: depth1, 4: depth1.
                    3: depth2 (since parent is 2), 5: depth2 (parent=2), 6: depth2 (parent=2)
                    7: depth3 (parent=3)

                Working employees by depth:

                  depth0: [1]
                  depth1: [4]   (because 2 is non-working, so not in the working part)
                  depth2: [5,6] 
                  depth3: [7]

                Then the working part: 1,4,5,6,7.

                Non-working: 2,3.

                Then permutation: 1,4,5,6,7,2,3.

          Check:

            employee1: first, works.
            employee4: works.
            employee5: works.
            employee6: works.
            employee7: works.
            employee2: non-working, and when arrives, working employees in its subtree: 5,6,7 -> count=3>2 -> doesn't work.
            employee3: non-working, and when arrives, working employees in its subtree: 7 -> count=1>0 -> doesn't work.

          Total working: 5, as required.

          But the sample output is: 7,3,6,5,2,1,4.

          It scheduled non-working employees in the working part? 

          How to reconcile? 

          Our method only schedules working employees in the working part? and non-working in the non-working part.

          The sample output interleaves non-working and working.

          But note: the sample output has a non-working employee (3) scheduled before some working employees (6,5,2,1,4) -> and 2 is non-working.

          Why is our method not generating interleaving? 

          Because we are not required to. We output any valid order.

          The problem says: if there are multiple solutions, output any.

          So our method is valid.

        Steps for the entire solution:

          Step 1: Read input.

          Step 2: Build the tree (children list) and depth array.

          Step 3: Compute min_work[1] and max_work[1] for the root.

          Step 4: If K is not in [min_work[1], max_work[1]], output -1.

          Step 5: Distribute the target K to the entire tree: 

             We do a DFS from the root to assign the working status and the target for each subtree.

             For a node u:

                Let T_min = sum(min_work[v] for v in children)
                Let T_max = sum(max_work[v] for v in children)
                Let S = T_max - T_min   # which is sum (max_work[v]-min_work[v])

                Then the two options for u:

                   Option1 (works): total = 1 + T_min, and the children can be any configuration as long as the sum is T_min? 
                   Option2 (does not work): total = max(T_min, A_u+1) [if T_min+S >= A_u+1] 

                Then min_work[u] = min(option1, option2) if option2 is available, else option1.

                max_work[u] = 1 + T_max

                Then for the given target k_u for the subtree of u:

                   if u works is possible: 
                         if k_u-1 is in [T_min, T_max] -> then we choose u works, and the children sum = k_u-1.
                   else if u does not work is possible and k_u in [max(T_min, A_u+1), T_max] (note: T_max = T_min+S) -> then we choose u does not work, and the children sum = k_u.

                Then we distribute the children sum T (which is either k_u-1 or k_u) to the children: 
                    x_v = min_work[v] + d_v, 
                    where d_v in [0, max_work[v]-min_work[v]] and sum_v d_v = T - T_min.

                We do this greedily: 
                    for each child v, 
                         d_v = min(max_work[v]-min_work[v], T_remaining)
                         T_remaining -= d_v
                    then x_v = min_work[v] + d_v.

                Then for each child v, we set the target for its subtree: k_v = x_v.

          Step 6: Mark working status for u:

                if we chose u works, then working[u] = True
                else working[u] = False

          Step 7: After we have the working status for every node, 

                We do a BFS to assign depth.

                Then we create two lists:
                   working_list = all nodes u that are working, sorted by depth (and then by node id or any order for the same depth)
                   non_working_list = all nodes u that are not working, in any order.

                Then the permutation = working_list + non_working_list.

          Step 8: Output the permutation.

        Let's test on the sample input 1: which is impossible -> skip.

        Sample input 2: 

          We have distributed the targets and working status:

            Root 1: 
               k1=5.
               We had: 
                 option1: works -> children sum=4.
                 option2: not works -> children sum=5.

               We chose option2? because we can? 
                 But wait: we had both available.

               How to choose? 

                 We can choose either. But note: if we choose option1: 
                    then the children must sum to 4.
                    for children 2 and 4: 
                         min_work[2]=3, min_work[4]=1 -> T_min=4.
                         and we distribute: 
                             child2: x2 = 3 + d2, child4: x4 = 1 + d4, and d2+d4 = 0 -> so x2=3, x4=1.
                    then for child2: k2=3.

               But for child2: 
                 T_min = 3 (from children 3,5,6), S= (max_work[3]-min_work[3]) + ... = 1.
                 min_work[2]= min(1+3, 3) = 3.
                 max_work[2]=5.
                 k2=3.
                 Possibilities:
                    works: then children sum=2? but T_min=3, so 2<3 -> not possible.
                    not works: then children sum=3, and must be>=3, and 3 in [3,4] -> valid.
                 Then for child2: we choose not work.

               Then for the children of 2: 
                    distribute 3: 
                      T_min = 3, so d_total=0.
                      then each child: k3=1, k5=1, k6=1.

               Then for child3: 
                 min_work[3]= min(1+1, 1) = 1 -> and we chose not work? 
                    k3=1: 
                      not work: then children sum=1, and must be>=1 -> valid.
                 Then for child3: not work.

               Then for the child of 3: k7=1.

               So working status: 
                  1: not work? but we chose option2 for the root? 
                  2: not work
                  3: not work
                  4: working? 
                  5: working? 
                  6: working? 
                  7: working? 

               But wait: we have not set the working status for 4,5,6,7? 

               How: 

                 For leaves: we have no children, then:

                    min_work = 1, max_work=1.

                    Then for leaf u: 
                       k_u=1.
                       Possibilities:
                          works: then children sum=0? -> in [0,0] -> valid? 
                          not works: then children sum=1? and must be>=A_u+1? 
                             For a leaf, the subtree has no child? so total working employees in children=0? 
                             Then we require 0>=A_u+1? which is false.

                       So the leaf must work.

               Therefore, working status for 4,5,6,7: work.

               Then the working_list = [1? but 1 is not working, 4,5,6,7] -> no, 1 is not working? 

               The working_list: [4,5,6,7]

               non_working_list: [1,2,3]

               Then permutation: [4,5,6,7,1,2,3] 

               But we computed: 
                 working_list = sorted by depth: 
                    depth: 
                      1: depth0? -> but not working.
                      2: depth1? -> working? no, non-working.
                      4: depth1? -> working? -> depth1: [4]
                      5: depth2? -> working? -> depth2: [5,6]  (and 6 at depth2)
                      7: depth3? -> working? -> depth3: [7]

                 Then working_list: [4,5,6,7] (if we sort by depth: 4 (depth1), then 5,6 (depth2), then 7 (depth3))

               Then non_working_list: [1,2,3] (in any order? we can do by id? or by depth: 
                    depth0: [1] -> then depth1: [2] -> then depth2: [3]? 
                 so [1,2,3])

               Then permutation: [4,5,6,7,1,2,3]

          But the sample output is: 7,3,6,5,2,1,4.

          However, both are valid.

        Therefore, we implement:

          Step 1: Read input.

          Step 2: Build graph.

          Step 3: Compute depth (using BFS) for all nodes.

          Step 4: Compute min_work and max_work from leaves to root (postorder DFS). We store:

             minw[u] = min_work[u]
             maxw[u] = max_work[u]

          Step 5: If K not in [minw[0], maxw[0]] (root is index0? but note: employees 1-indexed) -> output -1.

          Step 6: Distribute the target from the root:

             We use a queue? or DFS from the root. We maintain for each node u:

                 current_target: k_u

             Then for u:

                 Let children = children_list[u]

                 T_min = sum(minw[v] for v in children)
                 T_max = sum(maxw[v] for v in children)
                 S = T_max - T_min

                 # Check possibilities:
                 if k_u - 1 >= T_min and k_u - 1 <= T_max:
                     # u works
                     working[u] = True
                     total_children = k_u - 1
                 elif T_min + S >= A[u] + 1 and k_u >= max(T_min, A[u]+1) and k_u <= T_max:
                     # u does not work
                     working[u] = False
                     total_children = k_u
                 else:
                     # This should not happen because K is in [minw[u], maxw[u]]
                     raise Exception("Distribution failed")

                 # Distribute total_children to children: 
                 #   We have base T_min, and we need to add D = total_children - T_min to the children.
                 D = total_children - T_min
                 # For each child v, we can add up to add_v = maxw[v] - minw[v]
                 # We do:
                 for v in children:
                     add_v = min(D, maxw[v] - minw[v])
                     k_v = minw[v] + add_v
                     D -= add_v
                     # set the target for child v to k_v, then recursively distribute.

             However, we do it iteratively: we can do a BFS from the root.

          Step 7: After distributing, we mark working status for leaves: 
                For a leaf: working[u] = True? not necessarily: 
                  But we computed: 
                     min_work[leaf] = min(1, ...) -> 1, and the target k_u=1 -> then we choose the working option: 
                         then works -> working[u]=True.

          Step 8: Then we create:

                working_list = []
                non_working_list = []

                We traverse nodes by increasing depth, and for nodes at the same depth, in any order.

                For a node u:
                    if working[u] is True: append to working_list
                    else: append to non_working_list

                Then permutation = working_list + non_working_list.

          However, note: the working_list must be sorted by depth? and within the same depth we can any order.

          But we already traverse by depth: so we can do:

                for d from 0 to max_depth:
                  for each node u with depth d:
                    if working[u]: 
                         working_list.append(u)
                    else:
                         non_working_list.append(u)

          Then permutation = working_list + non_working_list.

        But wait: the working_list is sorted by depth? and non_working_list is also by depth? but we want working_list by depth and then non_working_list by depth? 

          But the non-working employees are scheduled after the working part, so their depth doesn't matter? 

          However, the condition for non-working employees: they require all working employees in their subtree to be scheduled before them. 
          But note: our working_list has been scheduled by increasing depth, so a working employee at depth d is scheduled before a non-working employee at depth d? 

          But a working employee at depth d might be in the subtree of a non-working employee at depth d-1? 

          However, the working employee at depth d is scheduled in the working part, which is before the non-working part? so it is scheduled before the non-working employee? 

          Therefore, it is safe.

        Let's test with the sample input 2:

          We determined:

            working status: 
               1: not work? 
               2: not work
               3: not work
               4: work
               5: work
               6: work
               7: work

          Depth:

            1: depth0
            2: depth1 (parent 1)
            4: depth1 (parent 1)
            3: depth2 (parent 2)
            5: depth2 (parent 2)
            6: depth2 (parent 2)
            7: depth3 (parent 3)

          Then:

            working_list: 
               depth0: none (because 1 is not working)
               depth1: [4] (because 4 is working, 2 is not)
               depth2: [5,6] (3 not working)
               depth3: [7]

            non_working_list:
               depth0: [1]
               depth1: [2]
               depth2: [3]
               depth3: []

          Then permutation = [4,5,6,7,1,2,3]

          Check the condition for employee1 (non-working, scheduled at position 5? the fifth element? but the list: 
             [4,5,6,7,1,2,3] -> 
                positions: 
                  1: 4
                  2: 5
                  3: 6
                  4: 7
                  5: 1
                  6: 2
                  7: 3

          Then when 1 arrives: 
             working employees that are subordinates and have arrived: 
                The working employees that are subordinates: 4,5,6,7? and they have all arrived? 
                count=4. Condition: >= A_1+1? A_1=4 -> 4>=5? no, 4>=4+1? no.

          We require at least 5? but we only have 4.

          This fails.

        Why? 

          In the distribution, we chose for the root: not work? then we require the children to have at least 5 working employees? but the children (2 and 4) only have: 
            subtree of 2: working employees: 5,6,7? -> 3
            subtree of 4: working employee: 4? -> 1
            total = 4, but we required 5? 

          How did we distribute? 

            For the root: 
               T_min = min_work[2] + min_work[4] = 3+1 = 4
               T_max = 5+1 = 6
               S = 2

               Option2: not work -> we set the children total = k1 = 5.

               Then we distribute: 
                  D = 5-4 = 1.
                  For child2: 
                      add2 = min(1, 5-3) = min(1,2)=1 -> so k2 = 3+1 = 4.
                  For child4: 
                      add4 = min(0, 1-1)=0 -> k4=1.

            Then for child2: 
               k2=4.
               For child2 (employee2): 
                 T_min = 1+1+1 = 3
                 T_max = 2+1+1 = 4? 
                 But wait: for employee3: 
                    min_work[3] = min(1+1, 1) = 1 -> as computed earlier.
                 So T_min = 3, T_max = 2+1+1? no: 
                    children of 2: 3,5,6
                    min_work[3]=1, min_work[5]=1, min_work[6]=1 -> T_min=3
                    max_work[3]=2, max_work[5]=1, max_work[6]=1 -> T_max=4

                 Then for child2: 
                    Possibilities:
                       works: then children sum=3? -> and 3 in [3,4] -> but then total=1+3=4 -> matches k2=4.
                       not works: then children sum=4? and must be>=3? (A_2+1=3) -> and 4 in [3,4] -> also valid.

                 We can choose either? 

                 Let's choose works: 
                    then working[2]=True.
                    Then for the children: 
                         total_children = 3? 
                         Distribute: 
                            T_min=3, D=0 -> so each child: k3=1, k5=1, k6=1.

                 Then for child3: 
                    k3=1 -> leaf: must work? so working[3]=True.
                 Then working status: 
                    employee2: works, employee3: works, employee5: works, employee6: works, employee7:? 
                    For child3: we have k3=1, and it works, then its children: total=0? 
                         employee7: then we set k7=0? -> but wait, leaf must work? 

                 How did we distribute for employee3: 
                    min_work[3] = 1? and we set k3=1 -> 
                       works: then children total=0? 
                       But employee3 has a child 7? 
                       Then for employee3: 
                          T_min = min_work[7]=1 -> so we require children total=0? -> impossible.

                 Therefore, we must choose for child2: not work.

                 Then for child2: 
                    working[2]=False
                    children total = 4? 
                    Distribute: 
                         T_min=3, D=1.
                         for child3: add3 = min(1, 2-1)=1 -> k3 = 1+1=2.
                         for child5: add5 = min(0, 0)=0 -> k5=1
                         for child6: add6 = min(0,0)=0 -> k6=1

                 Then for child3: 
                    k3=2.
                    For employee3: 
                       min_work[3] = 1
                       max_work[3] = 2
                       T_min = min_work[7]=1, T_max=1, S=0.
                       Possibilities:
                          works: then children sum=1? -> 1 in [1,1] -> valid -> then working[3]=True, and for child7: k7=1.
                          not works: then children sum=2? -> but T_min+S=1+0=1 < 0+1? -> not available.

                    So employee3: works, and then employee7: leaf -> works.

                 Then working status:
                    employee2: not work.
                    employee3: work.
                    employee4: work.
                    employee5: work.
                    employee6: work.
                    employee7: work.
                    employee1: not work.

                 Then total working: 1 (employee1? no, not work) -> employee3,4,5,6,7 -> 5.

          Then working_list (by increasing depth):

            depth0: 
            depth1: employee4 (work)
            depth2: employee3 (work), employee5 (work), employee6 (work) 
            depth3: employee7 (work)

          Then non_working_list: 
            depth0: employee1
            depth1: employee2
            depth2: none? (employee3 is working, employee5,6 working, employee7 not at depth2)
            depth3: none

          So permutation: [4,3,5,6,7,1,2]  (if within depth2 we order arbitrarily: 3,5,6)

          But wait: employee3 is at depth2, and its child employee7 is at depth3? so in the working_list, employee3 is scheduled before employee7.

          Check employee3: 
             When employee3 is scheduled, we have scheduled: 
                 working employees in its subtree: employee7 has not been scheduled? 
             Condition for employee3: working, and it requires at most A_3=0 working employees in its subtree? but count=0? -> works.

          Then at employee7: works.

          Then employee1: 
             arrives: working employees in its subtree that have arrived: 4,3,5,6,7? count=5>4? -> but employee1 is not working, so we require at least 5? -> met.

          employee2: 
             arrives: working employees in its subtree: 3,5,6,7? count=4>2? -> condition met.

          So valid.

        Therefore, we must be careful: in the distribution for the root, we chose not work? and then for child2 we chose not work? 

        And then we have working status for the root as not work, child2 not work, and the others work.

        Then the permutation: working_list = [4 (depth1), 3 (depth2), 5 (depth2), 6 (depth2), 7 (depth3)] 
            -> [4,3,5,6,7] 
        non_working_list = [1 (depth0), 2 (depth1)] -> [1,2] 
        Then total: [4,3,5,6,7,1,2]

        But the sample output is: 7,3,6,5,2,1,4.

        We output any valid order.

        Implementation:

          Steps:

            1. Read N, K.
            2. Read A[0..N-1] for employees 1..N -> index: A[0] for employee1, ... A[N-1] for employeeN.
            3. Read the list B: of length N-1, B[0] is the direct superior of employee2, B[1] for employee3, ... B[N-2] for employeeN.

            4. Build tree:

                  children = [[] for _ in range(N)]
                  for i in range(2, N+1):   # employee i
                      par = B[i-2]   # because the list B has N-1 elements: for employee2 to employeeN: index0 to N-2.
                      children[par-1].append(i-1)   # convert to 0-indexed.

            5. Compute depth:

                  depth = [-1] * N
                  from collections import deque
                  q = deque([0])   # employee1 at index0.
                  depth[0] = 0
                  while q:
                         u = q.popleft()
                         for v in children[u]:
                             depth[v] = depth[u]+1
                             q.append(v)

            6. Compute minw and maxw arrays (size N) from leaves to root.

                  We do a postorder traversal (DFS from the root and then process after children).

                  minw = [0]*N
                  maxw = [0]*N

                  Use a stack for DFS? or recursion? 

                  We do:

                     stack = [0]  # root
                     # We need to process children first, so we do iterative DFS and then process when popping.

                     order = []
                     q = [0]
                     while q:
                         u = q.pop()
                         order.append(u)
                         for v in children[u]:
                             q.append(v)

                     Then process in reverse order.

                  For a leaf u:

                     minw[u] = 1
                     maxw[u] = 1

                  For an internal node u:

                     T_min = 0
                     T_max = 0
                     for v in children[u]:
                         T_min += minw[v]
                         T_max += maxw[v]

                     S = T_max - T_min

                     # option1: u works -> 1+T_min
                     # option2: if T_min + S >= A[u]+1: then X = max(T_min, A[u]+1) 
                     #          else: X = a big number (inf)

                     minw[u] = min(1+T_min, X) if we defined X, else 1+T_min

                     maxw[u] = 1 + T_max   # because we can always have u work and all children at max.

                  Note: A[u] is the tolerance of u.

            7. Check if K in [minw[0], maxw[0]]? if not, output -1.

            8. Distribute the targets and assign working status.

                  working = [False]*N   # to be assigned

                  # We start from the root: 
                  k = [0] * N
                  k[0] = K

                  # Use a queue: 
                  from collections import deque
                  q = deque([0])

                  while q:
                         u = q.popleft()

                         # For u, we have k[u] = the target for the subtree of u.

                         # For the children: 
                         if not children[u]:
                             # leaf: 
                             #   minw[u]=1, maxw[u]=1 -> k[u] must be 1.
                             #   then u must work.
                             working[u] = True
                             continue

                         T_min = 0
                         T_max = 0
                         for v in children[u]:
                             T_min += minw[v]
                             T_max += maxw[v]
                         S = T_max - T_min

                         # Possibilities:
                         if k[u]-1 >= T_min and k[u]-1 <= T_max:
                             working[u] = True
                             total_children = k[u] - 1
                         elif T_min + S >= A[u]+1 and k[u] >= max(T_min, A[u]+1) and k[u] <= T_max:
                             working[u] = False
                             total_children = k[u]
                         else:
                             # This should not happen, but to be safe: we choose one? 
                             # But we know K is in [minw[u], maxw[u]], so one must hold.
                             # Let's choose the first if possible, else the second.
                             if k[u]-1 >= T_min and k[u]-1 <= T_max:
                                 working[u] = True
                                 total_children = k[u] - 1
                             else:
                                 working[u] = False
                                 total_children = k[u]

                         # Distribute total_children to children:
                         D = total_children - T_min
                         # We'll iterate over the children: we can do in any order? 
                         #   We want to assign as much as possible to each child until D is 0.
                         #   But we must not assign more than (maxw[v]-minw[v]) to any child.

                         # We'll create a list of the children and the capacity (maxw[v]-minw[v]).
                         # We can do arbitrary order? 
                         for v in children[u]:
                             add = min(D, maxw[v] - minw[v])
                             k[v] = minw[v] + add
                             D -= add
                             q.append(v)

                  # Note: for leaves, we set working[u]=True above.

            9. Build working_list and non_working_list by depth:

                  # We already have depth array.

                  # We'll create two lists: 
                  workers = []
                  non_workers = []

                  # We group by depth? or simply sort by depth.

                  # Since we have depth array, we can do:

                  # Let's create an array for nodes by depth: not necessary.

                  # Instead, we can:

                  #   Create a list of (depth, node_index) for all nodes, then sort by depth.

                  # But we can also:

                  nodes_by_depth = [[] for _ in range(max(depth)+1)]
                  for i in range(N):
                      nodes_by_depth[depth[i]].append(i)

                  for d in range(len(nodes_by_depth)):
                      for u in nodes_by_depth[d]:
                          if working[u]:
                              workers.append(u)
                          else:
                              non_workers.append(u)

                  permutation = workers + non_workers

                  Then output: [u+1 for u in permutation]   # convert to 1-indexed.

          Let's hope it fits in time and memory.

          Time: O(n)

          But note: the DFS for minw and maxw: we do a DFS that iterates over children, so O(n).

          Distribution: BFS that iterates over children, O(n).

          Building the list by depth: O(n).

        We'll write accordingly.

        However, note: the condition for the DFS of minw and maxw: 
            We did an iterative DFS by a stack? but we built a list of nodes in reverse order.

        But we can do a simple recursive DFS for minw and maxw? 
            But the tree might be deep? 

        We do iterative.

        Steps for minw and maxw:

          order = []
          stack = [0]
          while stack:
             u = stack.pop()
             order.append(u)
             for v in children[u]:
                 stack.append(v)

          Then for u in reversed(order):
             if children[u] is empty -> leaf: 
                 minw[u] = 1
                 maxw[u] = 1
             else:
                 T_min = sum(minw[v] for v in children[u])
                 T_max = sum(maxw[v] for v in children[u])
                 S = T_max - T_min
                 # option1: 1+T_min
                 # option2: if T_min+S >= A[u]+1, then max(T_min, A[u]+1) else inf
                 if T_min + S >= A[u] + 1:
                     option2 = max(T_min, A[u]+1)
                 else:
                     option2 = 10**9   # a big number

                 minw[u] = min(1+T_min, option2)
                 maxw[u] = 1 + T_max

        Then check the root: minw[0] and maxw[0]

        Then the rest.

        We must be cautious for the size of the numbers? T_min and T_max can be as large as n (500000) and we have 500000 nodes? so the sum for the root: T_min and T_max can be around 500000, which is acceptable.

        We'll code accordingly.

        Let's run on the sample input 1:

          N=5, K=3
          A = [3,2,1,2,2]  # for 1 to 5: index0 to 4.
          B = [1,2,2,1]   # for employee2: parent=B[0]=1 -> index0; employee3: parent=2 -> index1; employee4: parent=2 -> index2; employee5: parent=1 -> index3.

          Tree:

            children[0] = [1,4]   # employee2 and employee5 (index1 and index4)
            children[1] = [2,3]   # employee3 and employee4 (index2 and index3)
            children[2] = []
            children[3] = []
            children[4] = []

          Compute depth:

            depth[0]=0
            children0: [1,4] -> depth1=1, depth4=1
            children1: [2,3] -> depth2=2, depth3=2

          Then compute minw, maxw:

            Leaves: 2,3,4: minw=1, maxw=1.

            Node1 (index1, employee2): 
                children: [2,3] -> minw[2]=1, minw[3]=1 -> T_min=2
                T_max = 1+1=2
                S=0
                option2: T_min+S=2>=A[1]+1? A[1]=2 -> 2>=3? false -> so minw[1] = min(1+2, inf)=3
                maxw[1] = 1+2=3

            Node4 (index4, employee5): leaf? -> already done? no, we do in reverse order: 
                leaf: minw[4]=1, maxw[4]=1.

            Node0 (index0, employee1):
                children: [1,4] -> T_min = minw[1]+minw[4] = 3+1=4
                T_max = 3+1=4
                S=0
                option2: 4+0>=A[0]+1? 4>=4 -> true -> option2 = max(4,4)=4
                minw[0] = min(1+4,4)=4
                maxw[0] = 1+4=5

            Then K=3 is not in [4,5] -> output -1.

          Correct.

        We'll code accordingly.

        Note: The array A is given for employee1 to employeeN in order? so A[0] for employee1.

        Let's code.

        IMPORTANT: The condition for option2: we require T_min+S >= A[u]+1? 
            But note: T_min+S = T_min + (T_max - T_min) = T_max.
            So condition: T_max >= A[u]+1.

          Then we can write:

            if T_max >= A[u]+1:
                option2 = max(T_min, A[u]+1)
            else:
                option2 = a big number

        Also, when distributing the target for the children, we require for the non-working option: 
            k[u] must be in [max(T_min, A[u]+1), T_max]   (since T_max = T_min+S)

        We'll do:

          if working[u] is set to work: 
            condition: k[u]-1 is in [T_min, T_max]  -> which we checked.

          else (non-work): 
            condition: k[u] is in [max(T_min, A[u]+1), T_max]   -> we checked when choosing.

        But we also checked the condition for the non-work option: T_max>=A[u]+1? in the minw computation? 
          But note: we have an else: we set working[u] to work only if the work condition holds, and then we set non-work only if the non-work condition holds? 

        We are checking in the distribution step:

          if (work condition holds) then work
          else if (non-work condition holds) then non-work

        But we must ensure that at least one holds? because the minw[u] is the min of the two options, and k[u] is in [minw[u], maxw[u]], and maxw[u]=1+T_max.

        But note: if the work condition holds (k[u]-1 in [T_min, T_max]), then we choose work.
        Otherwise, we check the non-work condition: 
            we require: T_max>=A[u]+1 and k[u] in [max(T_min, A[u]+1), T_max]

        And note: minw[u] is min(1+T_min, ...) and the non-work option is available only if T_max>=A[u]+1, then minw[u] = min(1+T_min, max(T_min, A[u]+1)).

        Since k[u] is at least minw[u] and at most maxw[u]=1+T_max, and we have:

          if k[u] is not in the work condition, then we hope it is in the non-work condition.

        But note: if the work condition does not hold, it might be because k[u]-1 is not in [T_min, T_max], but k[u] might still not be in the non-work condition.

        However, we know k[u] is in [minw[u], maxw[u]], and minw[u] is the minimum of the two options.

        Therefore, if the work condition fails, the non-work condition must hold? 

        Because:

          minw[u] = min(1+T_min, X) where X is either INF or max(T_min, A[u]+1).

          And the non-work option is available only if X is available.

          And the work condition fails: k[u]-1 not in [T_min, T_max] -> then k[u] is not in [1+T_min, 1+T_min]? but wait: k[u] is at least minw[u] and at most 1+T_max.

          But k[u] is not necessarily 1+T_min? 

        Actually, the work condition fails only if k[u]-1 < T_min or k[u]-1 > T_max.

        Then:

          If k[u]-1 < T_min: then k[u] <= T_min (since k[u] is integer) -> then k[u] <= T_min.
          Then we consider non-work: we require k[u] >= max(T_min, A[u]+1) and k[u]<=T_max.

          Then we require T_min >= max(T_min, A[u]+1) -> which implies T_min>=A[u]+1.

          And k[u] in [T_min, T_max]? 

          But k[u] <= T_min -> so we require k[u] = T_min and T_min>=A[u]+1.

          And the non-work option is available only if T_max>=A[u]+1? which holds if T_min>=A[u]+1? and T_max>=T_min.

          Therefore, we require k[u]=T_min and T_min>=A[u]+1.

          Similarly, if k[u]-1 > T_max: then k[u] >= T_max+2? 

          Then non-work: we require k[u] <= T_max -> cannot hold.

        Therefore, we must ensure that the work condition fails only in the case k[u]-1 < T_min? and then we can use non-work only if k[u] = T_min and T_min>=A[u]+1.

        But wait: the minw[u] might be T_min (if non-work option is chosen) only if T_min>=A[u]+1? then k[u] must be at least T_min.

        So if k[u] < T_min, then it is below minw[u] -> which cannot happen.

        Therefore, the work condition fails only if k[u]-1 > T_max? and then we must use non-work? but non-work requires k[u] <= T_max, but we have k[u]>=T_max+2? -> impossible.

        Then we should never get to the else branch? 

        But we know k[u] is in [minw[u], maxw[u]], so k[u] is at most 1+T_max.

        And k[u]-1 > T_max implies k[u] > T_max+1, which is greater than 1+T_max? -> so k[u] cannot be greater than 1+T_max.

        Therefore, the work condition fails only if k[u]-1 < T_min, i.e., k[u] <= T_min.

        And then we use non-work only if:

            k[u] >= max(T_min, A[u]+1) and k[u] <= T_max.

        But k[u] <= T_min, so we require T_min >= max(T_min, A[u]+1) and k[u]=T_min.

        The condition T_min >= max(T_min, A[u]+1) means T_min>=A[u]+1.

        Therefore, we can only use non-work in this case if k[u] = T_min and T_min>=A[u]+1.

        So we can adjust:

          if k[u]-1 >= T_min and k[u]-1 <= T_max:
              # work
          elif k[u] == T_min and T_min >= A[u]+1 and k[u] <= T_max:   # note: k[u]<=T_max is automatically true because T_min<=T_max.
              # non-work
          else:
              # This should not happen? 
              # But we know k[u] is in [minw[u], maxw[u]], and minw[u] is min(1+T_min, ...) 
              #   and if the work condition fails, then k[u] <= T_min, and the non-work condition requires k[u]==T_min and T_min>=A[u]+1.
              #   If T_min < A[u]+1, then the non-work option is not available, but then minw[u] = min(1+T_min, ...) = min(1+T_min, INF)=1+T_min.
              #   Then k[u] must be at least 1+T_min? but we have k[u]<=T_min, and T_min < 1+T_min? so k[u] cannot be in [1+T_min, 1+T_max]? 
              #   -> contradiction.

          Therefore, we must design the minw[u] computation and the distribution consistently.

          Actually, in the minw[u] computation for non-work, we set:

             if T_max>=A[u]+1: 
                 option2 = max(T_min, A[u]+1)
             else:
                 option2 = INF

          Then minw[u] = min(1+T_min, option2)

          Now, if T_min < A[u]+1 and T_max>=A[u]+1, then option2 = A[u]+1.

          Then minw[u] = min(1+T_min, A[u]+1)

          And if k[u] is in [minw[u], 1+T_max], then:

             if k[u] <= T_min: then k[u] is at most T_min, but minw[u] = min(1+T_min, A[u]+1) which is <= T_min only if 1+T_min <= T_min? (false) or A[u]+1<=T_min? 
                 so if A[u]+1<=T_min, then minw[u]=A[u]+1, and k[u] in [A[u]+1, ...] -> then k[u]>=A[u]+1, so k[u] cannot be <=T_min? 

          This is complex.

          Alternatively, we can simply do:

            if (working option is available and k[u]-1 in [T_min, T_max]):
                choose work.
            else if (non-work option is available and k[u] in [max(T_min, A[u]+1), T_max]):
                choose non-work.
            else:
                # This should not happen, but we output an error for safety?
                # But we know k[u] is in [minw[u], maxw[u]], so one of the two must hold.
                # We choose arbitrarily? 
                # Since the minw[u] is the minimum of the two, we try:

                if minw[u] == 1+T_min and k[u]-1 in [T_min, T_max]:
                    choose work
                else:
                    # then minw[u] = option2 = max(T_min, A[u]+1) and non-work option is available? 
                    if k[u] in [max(T_min, A[u]+1), T_max]:
                        choose non-work
                    else:
                        # then work option must be available? 
                        if k[u]-1 in [T_min, T_max]:
                            choose work
                        else:
                            choose non-work   # even if k[u] not in the range? 

          But we know it should be in the range.

        Given the complexity, and since we know k[u] is in [minw[u], maxw[u]], we can rely on the conditions.

        Actually, note: minw[u] is the minimum of 1+T_min and (if available) option2.

        And the non-work option is available only if T_max>=A[u]+1.

        Then the range of achievable values for the subtree of u is:

          If we choose work: we can achieve 1 + x for any x in [T_min, T_max]  -> [1+T_min, 1+T_max]
          If we choose non-work: we can achieve y for any y in [max(T_min, A[u]+1), T_max]  (but note: we can also achieve any y in [T_min, T_max] that is at least A[u]+1? but we can achieve any integer in [max(T_min, A[u]+1), T_max] because we can upgrade arbitrarily)

        Then the entire set of achievable values is:

          [1+T_min, 1+T_max]  (work)  U  [max(T_min, A[u]+1), T_max] (non-work)

        And minw[u] = min(1+T_min, ...) and if non-work is available, then minw[u] = min(1+T_min, max(T_min, A[u]+1))

        And maxw[u] = 1+T_max.

        Now, we require k[u] to be in the union.

        But our distribution must assign to work or non-work.

        We'll do:

            work_available = (1+T_min <= 1+T_max)   # always true
            work_interval = [1+T_min, 1+T_max]

            non_work_available = (T_max >= A[u]+1)
            non_work_interval = [max(T_min, A[u]+1), T_max]

            if k[u] in work_interval:
                choose work
            elif non_work_available and k[u] in non_work_interval:
                choose non-work
            else:
                # error: but we know k[u] in [minw[u], maxw[u]] = [min(work_interval[0], non_work_interval[0] if available), 1+T_max]
                #   and the intervals might overlap? 
                #   but if they are disjoint, then we might have a gap?
                #   However, we must cover the entire [minw[u], 1+T_max]? 
                #   But minw[u] = min(work_interval[0], non_work_interval[0] if available) and the union is work_interval U non_work_interval.
                #   But there might be a gap between T_max and 1+T_min? 
                #   For instance, if T_max < 1+T_min, then non_work_interval = [max(T_min, A[u]+1), T_max] and work_interval = [1+T_min, 1+T_max] (which is empty if T_max < 1+T_min? but T_max>=T_min, and 1+T_min>=T_min, so if T_max < 1+T_min, then the work_interval is [1+T_min, 1+T_max] -> empty? 
                #   But then non_work_interval = [max(T_min, A[u]+1), T_max] and we require non_work_available: T_max>=A[u]+1 -> holds.
                #   And minw[u] = min(1+T_min, max(T_min, A[u]+1)) -> which might be in non_work_interval? 
                #   But the union is non_work_interval? 
                #   So k[u] must be in non_work_interval.

                # Therefore, we should not get here.

                # We choose non-work if available and k[u] <= T_max? 
                if non_work_available and k[u] <= T_max and k[u] >= max(T_min, A[u]+1):
                    choose non-work
                else:
                    choose work   # even if k[u] not in [1+T_min, 1+T_max]? 

          But we know k[u] is in [minw[u], maxw[u]], and if work is not available and non_work is available, then minw[u] = max(T_min, A[u]+1) and we already checked the non_work_interval.

        We'll output an error message in this else branch.

        But the sample input2: 
          root: u=0, k0=5.
          T_min=4, T_max=6? 
          work_interval = [1+4, 1+6] = [5,7]
          non_work_interval = [max(4,4+1),6] = [5,6]  # since A[0]=4 -> A[u]+1=5

          Then k0=5 is in work_interval and also in non_work_interval.

          We choose work (because we check work first) -> then total_children=4.

          Then for children: 
             child2: k2=?
                 T_min = 3, T_max=4? 
                 work_interval = [4,5]  (1+3=4, 1+4=5)
                 non_work_interval: [max(3,2+1),4] = [max(3,3),4]=[3,4]   # for child2: A[1]=2 -> A[u]+1=3

                 Then k2=4: 
                    work: 4 in [4,5] -> choose work -> then children_total=3.
                 Then for children of child2: 
                    child3: k3=?
                      T_min = 1, T_max=1? 
                      work_interval = [2,2]  (if we consider T_min=1, then 1+1=2; T_max=1 -> then 1+T_max=2? so [2,2])
                      non_work_interval: T_max>=A[2]+1? A[2] is the tolerance for employee3? which is the third employee: A[2]=0? -> A[u]+1=1. T_max=1>=1 -> true, non_work_interval = [max(1,1),1] = [1,1] -> but then k3=?
                 But we have children_total=3 to distribute to three children: 
                    child3: minw[3]=? 
                      In the minw computation for child3: 
                         leaf: minw[3]=1, maxw[3]=1.
                    Similarly for child5 and child6: leaves.

                 Then T_min=3, T_max=3.
                 Then for child2: we set k2=4 -> then we distribute: 
                    base=3, D=1.
                    For child3: add = min(1, 1-0)=0? -> then k3=1? 
                    Then for child5: add = min(1,0)=0? 
                    Then for child6: add = min(1,0)=0? 
                 Then D=1 remains -> this is an error.

          Therefore, we must distribute D completely? 

          How we did: 

             We did:

                 for v in children[u]:
                     add = min(D, maxw[v]-minw[v])
                     k[v] = minw[v] + add
                     D -= add

             But then if D>0 after the loop, it's an error.

          We should check:

             if D>0: then it's an error.

          But we know T_min + D = total_children, and we have total_children = T_min + D, and D must be <= S (which is T_max-T_min) by the distribution.

          And we did min(D, capacity) for each child.

          But the total capacity is S, so if D>S, then we cannot distribute.

          However, we have total_children = T_min + D, and we know total_children<=T_max -> so D<=T_max-T_min=S.

          Therefore, the distribution should always work.

          But in the example: 
                children: 3,5,6 -> capacities: for 3: 1 (maxw[3]=1, minw[3]=1 -> 0? because maxw[v]-minw[v]=0) 
                So capacity=0 for each leaf? 
                Then D=1, and we cannot add.

          Why for a leaf, maxw[v]-minw[v]=0? 

          Then S = 0.

          But we had: for child2: T_min=3, T_max=3, so S=0.

          Then total_children=4 is not in [3,3]? 

          This is the error: we set for child2: 
             work: then total_children = 4-1=3? but then we use work option for child2, and then the children_total=3? which is in [3,3] (T_min=3, T_max=3) -> then we don't need to distribute any extra.

          But we did: 
             k2=4 -> work: then total_children = 3? 
             Then we don't have D=1? we have D=0.

          So in the distribution, we set:

             total_children = 3? 
             T_min = 3, so D=0.

          Then we don't add anything.

          But in the example above, we had for the root: 
             work: then total_children = 5-1=4? 
             Then for the root: D = 4-4=0.

          Then for the children of the root: 
             child2: k2=3? 
             child4: k4=1.

          Then for child2: 
             k2=3: then work option: children_total=2? -> but T_min=3, so 2<3 -> not available.

             then non-work option: requires children_total=3? and 3 in [max(3,3),3] -> [3,3] -> valid.

          So we should have set for child2: non-work.

          Therefore, in the distribution for the root, we set:

             working[0] = False   # because we chose non-work? 
             total_children = 5   (k0=5)

             Then D = 5-4 = 1.

             For child2: 
                 capacity = maxw[2]-minw[2] = 3-3=0 -> add=0, k2=3.
             For child4:
                 capacity = 1-1=0 -> add=0, k4=1.

             Then D=1 remains -> which is an error.

          Why? 

          We had T_min=4, T_max=6? 
          Then S=2.

          We need to distribute 1 (since total_children=5, T_min=4, D=1).

          The capacities: 
             child2: capacity=0? 
             child4: capacity=0? 
          Then we cannot distribute? 

          But we computed minw and maxw for the children: 
             child2: minw=3, maxw=3 -> capacity=0
             child4: minw=1, maxw=1 -> capacity=0

          Then S=0, but we had T_max=6? 

          How did we get T_max=6 for the root? 

          For the root: 
             T_max = sum_{v in children} maxw[v] = maxw[2] + maxw[4] = 3+1 = 4, then 1+4=5.

          But wait: we computed for the root: 
             maxw[0] = 1 + T_max = 1+ (3+1)=5.

          Then T_max for the children = 4, so S= T_max - T_min = 4-4=0.

          Then non-work option: T_min+S=4>=5? -> 4>=5 false, so non-work option not available? 

          But then minw[0] = min(5, ...)=5.

          Then k0=5 must be in [5,5]? then we choose work: 
             working[0]=True, then total_children=4.
             Then D=0.

          Then for child2: 
             k2=3: we choose work: then children_total=2? -> fails.

          Or non-work: then we require children_total=3? -> and we set k2=3, then for child2: 
             work: fails, non-work: available? 
                T_max for children of 2: 4? no, 3? 
                Actually: 
                   child2: children: 3,5,6 -> minw=1,1,1 -> T_min=3, maxw=1,1,1 -> T_max=3? 
                Then non-work option: T_max>=3? (A[1]=2 -> A[u]+1=3) -> 3>=3 -> true.
                then non_work_interval = [max(3,3),3] = [3,3] -> valid for k2=3.

          How did we get for child2: maxw=3? 

          But in the minw and maxw computation for child2: 
             T_min = 1+1+1=3
             T_max = 1+1+1=3   (for the children: leaves have maxw=1)
             then maxw[2] = 1+3=4? -> no, maxw[2] = 1 + T_max = 1+3=4.

          Then for the root: 
             T_max = maxw[2] + maxw[4] = 4+1=5.
             Then non-work option: T_min+S = 4+ (5-4)=5 >=5 -> true.

          So option2 = max(4,5)=5.

          minw[0]=min(5,5)=5.

          Then for the root: 
             k0=5: 
                work: 5-1=4 in [4,5]? 4 in [4,5] -> true, so we can choose work.
                non-work: 5 in [5,5]? true.

          We choose work: then we don't have the distribution problem for the children with D=1.

          Therefore, the error was in the capacity for child2: 
             We used maxw[2] for the capacity? 
                capacity = maxw[2] - minw[2] = 4-3=1.

          Then in the distribution for the root: 
             D=1.
             child2: add = min(1,1)=1 -> k2 = 3+1=4.
             child4: add=0.

          Then for child2: 
             k2=4: 
                work: 4-1=3 in [3,4]? -> 3 in [3,4] -> true.

                then for child2's children: 
                   T_min=3, T_max=3, so we distribute: 
                       base=3, D=0? -> k3=1, k5=1, k6=1.

             Then all work.

          So the capacities are not 0 for child2: 
             minw[2]=3, maxw[2]=4, so
