We are given an integer N and a string of length 2N containing 'C', 'A', and '.' (empty).
There are exactly N pairs of adjacent seats (so the seats are arranged as: [pair1_seat1, pair1_seat2], [pair2_seat1, pair2_seat2], ...). Note: the problem states that the seats are arranged in a single line and that each pair consists of two adjacent seats.

The goal: rearrange the students by moving a student only if it is next to an empty seat (and then moving that student to the empty seat) so that in the final arrangement, every 'C' (Computing student) has an 'A' (Arts student) as their buddy. Note: buddies are defined only for adjacent seats within the same pair. Therefore, for each pair, if there is one or two 'C's, then we must have at least one 'A' in the pair to be the buddy of each 'C'. However, note that the condition is that each Computing student must have an Arts student as a buddy. Since the buddy is the adjacent seat in the same pair, that means:

In a pair, we cannot have two 'C's without having at least one 'A'? Actually, if a pair has two 'C's, then each 'C' has the other 'C' as a buddy? But the problem requires that each 'C' must have an 'A' as a buddy. Therefore, we cannot have a pair of two 'C's. Similarly, a pair with one 'C' and one '.' (empty) would leave the 'C' without an 'A' buddy? Actually, the empty seat doesn't count as an Arts student. So the requirement is per Computing student: the buddy (the adjacent seat in the same pair) must be an Arts student.

Therefore, in each pair that contains at least one 'C', we must have at least one 'A'. Moreover, if a pair has two 'C's, then both must have an Arts buddy? But note: the buddy for the first seat is the second, and for the second seat is the first. So if a pair is (C, C), then both are buddies to each other, but neither is an Arts student. Hence, such a pair is invalid.

Therefore, in the final arrangement, each pair must be one of:
  (A, A) -> both buddies are Arts, so if there is a C in the pair? Actually no C in the pair -> no problem.
  (A, C) -> the C has an A buddy? Yes (the adjacent seat is A). The A has a C buddy? But the problem doesn't require anything for A. Only C must have an A buddy.
  (C, A) -> similarly the C has an A buddy.
  (C, .) -> This is invalid because the C has an empty buddy, not an A.
  (., C) -> similarly invalid.
  (A, .) -> valid? The A is not required to have a buddy? But note: the condition is only for C. However, we might have an extra A that isn't being used? That's okay.
  (., A) -> similarly okay.

But wait: the problem says "each student from the School of Computing has a buddy from the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences". So the only requirement is that every C must have its buddy (the adjacent seat in the same pair) being an A.

Therefore, the valid pairs for a pair that contains a C are:
  (A, C) -> the C is adjacent to A (so buddy is A)
  (C, A) -> the C is adjacent to A
  (A, A) -> if we have two A's, that's okay? Actually, if we have two A's, then there's no C? Then it's okay.

But note: we cannot have a C in a pair without an A? Actually, if a pair has two C's, that's invalid. If a pair has one C and one empty? That's invalid. If a pair has one C and one A? Then that C is satisfied.

However, what if we have a pair with two A's? Then no problem.

But also, note: we can have empty seats. The problem says that we move students only when they are next to an empty seat. So we can rearrange arbitrarily? Actually, the operation: choose a student sitting next to an empty seat and move that student to the empty seat. This is similar to sliding puzzles? But note: the moves can be done arbitrarily and the problem doesn't specify the number of moves, so we are allowed to do any number of moves as long as each move is valid.

However, we must consider the constraints: we cannot create new seats, and the total number of C and A is fixed.

Important: The problem says "at most N pairs of buddies" meaning that the pairs are fixed? Actually, the problem states: "There are at most N pairs of buddies by definition." because there are N pairs of seats. But note: the pairs are fixed? The problem does not say that we can reassign pairs. The pairs are defined by the adjacent seats: the entire table is a line of 2N seats, and the pairs are consecutive adjacent pairs? Actually, the problem says: "seats belonging to the same pair are adjacent in the line". And there are N pairs. So the entire arrangement is:

  [pair0_seat0, pair0_seat1], [pair1_seat0, pair1_seat1], ... [pair_{N-1}_seat0, pair_{N-1}_seat1]

But note: the pairs are adjacent? Actually, the entire table is a line: 
  seat0, seat1, seat2, seat3, ... , seat_{2N-1}
Then the pairs are (seat0, seat1) as the first pair, (seat2, seat3) as the second, ... (seat_{2N-2}, seat_{2N-1}) as the last.

So the pairs are fixed: they are consecutive blocks of two.

Therefore, we cannot change the pairing. The rearrangement must be done by moving students (only when adjacent to an empty seat) to other empty seats. The goal is to assign students to the fixed pairs such that in each pair that contains a C, the other seat in the same pair must be an A.

Now, note: we are allowed to move a student only if it is next to an empty seat. This implies that we can only move students that have an empty neighbor. Since the table is linear, "next to" means adjacent in the linear arrangement. Therefore, the movement is similar to sliding a tile in a linear puzzle.

However, the problem does not require the minimal number of moves, only the possibility and one valid final arrangement.

We are to output:
  If not possible: "NO"
  Else: "YES", and then a string of length 2N representing a valid final arrangement.

Constraints: N up to 200,000 -> the algorithm must be O(N) or O(N log N).

How to approach?

First, note that the total number of C's and A's must be fixed. Let:
  total_C = count of 'C' in the initial string
  total_A = count of 'A'
  empty = count of '.' = 2N - total_C - total_A

In the final arrangement, we must have the same counts.

But the requirement for the arrangement: for each pair i (from 0 to N-1), consider the two seats at positions (2i, 2i+1). For each pair, if there is at least one C, then the other seat must be an A. This means that a pair cannot have two C's. Also, a pair cannot have a single C without an A? Actually, if a pair has one C and one A, then the C is adjacent to the A (in the same pair) and that satisfies the condition. But note: the two seats in a pair are adjacent, so if the pair is (C, A) or (A, C), then the C has an A as buddy.

However, what if the pair has two A's? Then there is no C? Then no problem.

But what if the pair has one C and one empty? Then the C does not have an A as buddy? So that is invalid.

Therefore, the necessary conditions for the final arrangement:

1. Each pair must be one of: [A, A], [A, C], [C, A], [A, .], [., A], [., .], but note that [C, .] and [., C] are invalid. Also [C, C] is invalid.

But wait: [A, .] is acceptable? Because there is no C in that pair? Then the condition for C is vacuously satisfied. Similarly, [., .] is acceptable.

However, we can have a pair with one A and one C? Then that C is satisfied? Yes.

But note: we might have more than one C? Actually, the requirement is that every C must be in a pair that has an A. So if a pair has a C, then the other seat must be an A. Therefore, we cannot have a pair with a C and a non-A (i.e., either empty or C).

So the valid pairs that contain a C must be either (A, C) or (C, A). Therefore, in the entire arrangement, the number of pairs that contain a C must be exactly the number of C's? Because each C occupies one seat and the other seat must be an A. And note: a pair cannot contain two C's.

Therefore, the number of C's must be at most the number of pairs? Actually, each pair that contains a C must have exactly one C? Because two C's in one pair is invalid, and one C per pair is the maximum we can have? So the total number of C's must be at most N? And also, each C must be matched with an A in the same pair. But note: an A might be shared? Actually, if a pair has two A's, then that A is not being used for a C? But if we have a pair (A, C), then the A in that pair is being used to satisfy the C. However, if we have two C's, we require two A's (each in the same pair as the C). Therefore, the total number of A's must be at least the number of C's? Because each C requires one A in the same pair.

But note: there might be A's that are not in the same pair as a C. So the total number of A's must be at least the number of C's.

However, we have the same counts in the initial and final arrangement. So condition:

  total_A >= total_C   [necessary]

But is that sufficient? Not exactly, because we have to assign the students to the fixed pairs and we also have empty seats.

Moreover, we must be able to rearrange the students via moves that require adjacent empty seats.

How to model the rearrangement? This is a classic problem of sliding tiles. The key insight: the moves are reversible? But we don't need the minimal moves, only possibility and a valid arrangement.

Alternatively, we can think combinatorially: what are the invariants? However, note that the problem allows any number of moves, so we can rearrange arbitrarily? Actually, no: because we can only move a student if it is adjacent to an empty seat. This is similar to the 15-puzzle. The well-known fact: in a linear puzzle with one empty space, we can rearrange the tiles arbitrarily if and only if the permutation parity condition holds? But note: we have multiple empty seats? Actually, the number of empty seats is 2N - total_C - total_A, which can be arbitrary.

However, there is a known result: in a graph, if the graph is connected and the moves are swaps with an adjacent empty tile, then the solvability condition is the permutation parity? But note: we have multiple empty tiles? Actually, the problem is that we can move any student that is adjacent to an empty seat to that empty seat. This is equivalent to having multiple empty tiles and we can slide any tile into an adjacent empty tile. Then the graph of configurations is connected? Actually, if there is at least one empty tile, then we can move any tile to any location? That is true for a grid? But here we have a linear arrangement (a line). In a line, with k empty seats, we can rearrange the tiles arbitrarily? Because we can use the empty seats as buffers to swap any two adjacent tiles? Then eventually we can rearrange arbitrarily.

Therefore, the only constraints are the counts and the necessary condition for the pairs? But wait: if we can rearrange arbitrarily, then the problem reduces to: is there an arrangement of the same set of characters (same counts of C, A, and '.') such that for every pair (two consecutive seats at positions 2i and 2i+1), if the pair has a C then the other seat must be an A?

And we know that the necessary conditions are:
  total_A >= total_C   (because each C requires an A in the same pair)

But is that sufficient? Consider: we have to assign the C's and A's to the pairs. We have N pairs. We must assign the C's such that each C is in a pair that also has an A. Therefore, we must assign at least one A for each C. However, note: a pair can have at most one C? Because if a pair has two C's, then we would need two A's in the same pair? But that pair only has two seats. So we cannot have two C's in one pair. Therefore, each pair can contain at most one C.

Therefore, the number of pairs that contain at least one C must be exactly the number of C's? Because each C must be in a distinct pair? Yes. And each of these pairs must also have an A? But note: the other seat in the pair must be an A. Therefore, for each of these pairs that contain a C, we must assign an A to the other seat.

But what if we have a pair that has two A's? Then that pair uses two A's. The A's that are not in the same pair as a C are free.

Therefore, the necessary conditions are:

  1. total_A >= total_C   (each C requires one A in the same pair)
  2. The number of pairs that are designated to contain a C must be exactly total_C. And for each such pair, we must assign one A. Therefore, the total number of A's must be at least total_C? But we already have condition 1.

However, condition 1 is necessary and sufficient for the existence of an assignment? But we also have to assign the remaining A's and the empty seats arbitrarily to the remaining pairs? And we have:

  Total pairs = N
  Pairs that contain a C: total_C pairs (each with one C and one A? But wait: we can have a pair with one C and one A? Or we can have a pair that has one C and one A? Actually, we must assign one A to the same pair as the C. Then the remaining A's and the empty seats can be assigned arbitrarily to the remaining pairs? As long as we don't have a pair with a C and a non-A.

So the assignment:

  We need to assign total_C pairs to be either "AC" or "CA". In these pairs, we have one C and one A.

  Then the remaining pairs: we have:
      remaining_A = total_A - total_C
      empty_seats = 2N - total_C - total_A   [which is also the number of empty seats]

  And the remaining pairs: N - total_C pairs.

  In each of these remaining pairs, we can put any combination of A and '.' as long as the total A's in these pairs is remaining_A and the total empty seats is the given empty_seats? Actually, we can assign arbitrarily: we can have:
      [A, A] -> uses two A's
      [A, .] -> uses one A and one empty
      [., A] -> same
      [., .] -> two empties

  But note: we must use exactly remaining_A A's and empty_seats empties. Therefore, we must have:

      The remaining pairs must account for the remaining_A A's and the empty_seats.

      The total number of seats in the remaining pairs: 2*(N - total_C) = 2N - 2*total_C.

      And we have: remaining_A + empty_seats = (total_A - total_C) + (2N - total_C - total_A) = 2N - 2*total_C.

      So it matches.

Therefore, condition 1 (total_A >= total_C) is necessary and sufficient? But wait: what about the initial arrangement? We said we can rearrange arbitrarily? So if condition 1 holds, then we can output any arrangement that satisfies:

  - Exactly total_C pairs are of the form "AC" or "CA", and the remaining pairs are made of A's and '.' in any combination (without violating the counts).

However, we must also be able to achieve that arrangement by moving students that are adjacent to an empty seat. But we argued that with at least one empty seat, we can rearrange arbitrarily? Actually, that is true for a line with multiple empty seats? The known result for the 15-puzzle in one dimension: if there is at least one empty space, then any permutation can be achieved? Because we can use the empty spaces to move any tile to any location? Therefore, the only constraints are the counts and the condition that total_A >= total_C.

But wait: the sample inputs:

Sample Input #1: "C.AAAC" for N=3.
  total_C = 2, total_A = 3, empty = 1 -> 2+3+1=6, and 2N=6.
  Condition: total_A (3) >= total_C (2) -> holds.

  How can we assign?
    We need 2 pairs to have one C and one A. Then the remaining 1 pair must have: total remaining A = 3-2 = 1, and empty = 1 -> so the remaining pair must be either [A, .] or [., A].

    The sample output: "CAA.AC"

    Pairs: 
        pair0: "CA" -> C has A as buddy -> valid.
        pair1: "A." -> no C -> valid.
        pair2: "AC" -> C has A as buddy -> valid.

    So it works.

Sample Input #2: "AAA.CCAC" for N=4 -> length 8.
  Count: 
      A: 5? 
          string: "AAA.CCAC" -> 
          A: positions 0,1,2,6,7 -> 5
          C: positions 4,5,6? -> wait: the string is "AAA.CCAC": 
          index0: 'A'
          index1: 'A'
          index2: 'A'
          index3: '.'
          index4: 'C'
          index5: 'C'
          index6: 'A'
          index7: 'C'

          Actually: 
            A: 0,1,2,6 -> that's 4? and index7 is 'C'. 
            So total_A = 4, total_C = 3, empty=1.
          Condition: total_A (4) >= total_C (3) -> holds.

          But the sample output is "NO".

Why? 

Therefore, condition total_A>=total_C is not sufficient.

What is the issue? The issue is that we might not be able to assign the pairs without violating the requirement that each pair that has a C must have an A? But we have enough A's.

However, note: in the sample input2: we have 3 C's and 4 A's. But we have to assign 3 pairs for the C's (each with one A). Then the remaining one pair: we have 4-3=1 A and 1 empty seat? That would be one pair that must have the remaining A and the empty. But the total seats: 8, and we have 3+4+1=8. So why "NO"?

The problem is that we cannot rearrange arbitrarily? Or is there an invariant we missed?

Let me check the initial arrangement: "AAA.CCAC" -> we have 8 seats: [0:A, 1:A, 2:A, 3:., 4:C, 5:C, 6:A, 7:C]

We cannot move a student arbitrarily? Because we can only move a student that is adjacent to an empty seat. But with one empty seat, we can only move adjacent to the empty seat. Therefore, the connectivity of the graph of configurations might not be connected? Actually, in a linear arrangement with one empty tile, the graph is connected only if the empty tile can be moved arbitrarily? Actually, we can move the empty tile to any position? How?

Consider: the moves: 
  We can move a student from the left of the empty seat to the empty seat? Then the empty moves left.
  Or from the right? Then the empty moves right.

Therefore, the empty tile can move arbitrarily. Then we can rearrange arbitrarily? But wait: the well-known 15-puzzle in 1D: with one empty tile, we can rearrange the tiles arbitrarily? Actually, we can: by using the empty tile to swap adjacent tiles, we can do any permutation? However, note that the parity of the permutation might matter? But in 1D, if we can move the empty tile arbitrarily, then we can achieve any permutation? Actually, no: because the moves are transpositions? Actually, each move is a swap of the empty tile with an adjacent tile. Therefore, the parity of the permutation changes with each move? But we don't care about the parity of the entire permutation? Because we are only concerned with the counts and the arrangement per pair? Actually, the problem does not require a specific permutation? Only the condition per pair.

But then why is sample input2 "NO"?

Alternative explanation: the problem might be that we cannot assign the C's to distinct pairs? Because we have to satisfy the condition that each C is in a pair that has an A? But we have 3 C's and we have 4 A's, so we can assign 3 pairs as either "AC" or "CA", and one pair as "A." or ".A". 

But note: the fixed pairs? The arrangement must assign the students to the fixed consecutive pairs? The problem does not let us reassign the pairing? The pairs are fixed: the first two seats form a pair, the next two, and so on.

Therefore, we have to assign the students to the entire sequence of 2N seats such that:

  - The counts are the same as the initial.
  - For each i from 0 to N-1, the pair (s[2i], s[2i+1]) is one of the valid pairs (where valid for a pair that has a C is only when the other is an A).

But also, we have to be able to rearrange the initial arrangement to the final arrangement via moves? And we argued that with at least one empty seat, we can do any permutation? But that is not true: in a linear arrangement with one empty seat, we can only achieve the permutations that have the same parity? Actually, the empty tile moves and the permutation of the non-empty tiles is arbitrary? 

Wait: in a linear arrangement with one empty tile, we can achieve any permutation? Because we can simulate rotations? Actually, we can move the empty tile to the left end, then move the tiles one by one? But it is known that the 15-puzzle in 1D with one empty tile is solvable for any permutation? 

But then why sample input2 is NO?

Let me check the sample input2: 
  Initial: "AAA.CCAC" -> we have 3 C's: at positions 4,5,7 and one empty at 3.

  We want to form an arrangement that satisfies the condition.

  How about we try to assign the pairs:

      Pair0: seats0 and seat1 -> we can assign two A's? 
      Pair1: seats2 and seat3 -> we have an A and an empty? 
      Pair2: seats4 and seat5 -> two C's? -> invalid! because two C's in a pair.

  So we cannot have two C's in one pair.

  Therefore, we must split the two C's that are adjacent? But we have an empty at position3. How can we move?

  We must assign the C's to distinct pairs? We have 4 pairs. We have 3 C's, so we need 3 distinct pairs for the C's. Each of these pairs must also have an A? But note: the pair that contains a C must have an A? So the pair must have one C and one A? Then the three pairs would be: "CA" or "AC" for each.

  Then the remaining pair must be: two A's? But we have only one A left? total_A=4, and we use 3 A's for the pairs with C's? Then we have one A left and one empty? So the remaining pair must be "A." or ".A".

  So the arrangement must be:

      Pair0: ? 
      Pair1: ?
      Pair2: ?
      Pair3: ?

  We have 3 pairs that must be "CA" or "AC", and one pair that is "A." or ".A".

  How about:

      Pair0: AC
      Pair1: AC
      Pair2: AC
      Pair3: .A   -> but then we have only one A left? Actually, we have 4 A's: we use 3 in the AC pairs? Then one A remains for the last pair? and one empty.

      So the last pair must be either "A." or ".A".

  Then the entire string would be: 
      AC AC AC .A -> "ACACAC.A" -> but this has 4 pairs: 
          [A,C], [A,C], [A,C], [.,A] -> valid.

  But note: we have to assign the same counts: 
        A: 4? in "ACACAC.A": 
            A: positions0,2,4,7 -> 4 A's -> correct.
        C: positions1,3,5 -> 3 C's -> correct.
        empty: position6 -> 1 empty -> correct.

  Why is the sample output "NO"?

  Therefore, the problem must be that we cannot rearrange the initial arrangement "AAA.CCAC" to "ACACAC.A" via the allowed moves? Or is there another constraint?

  But we argued that we can rearrange arbitrarily? Then why "NO"?

  Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the initial arrangement has an invariant? 

  Another possibility: the problem might require that the rearrangement must be done without violating the condition at intermediate steps? But the problem does not say that. It only says the final arrangement.

  Therefore, we must be able to get from the initial to the final? And we can? 

  However, the sample output is "NO". Therefore, we must look for an additional constraint.

  Let me check the provided sample output: 
      Input2: "AAA.CCAC" -> output "NO".

  So there must be an additional necessary condition.

  What if we try to assign the pairs without having two C's adjacent? But note: in the initial arrangement, the two C's are adjacent? But we can move them? 

  However, consider the movement: we have one empty. To move the C at position4: we must have an empty adjacent. The empty is at position3. So we can move the C at position4 to position3? Then the arrangement becomes: "AAAC.CAC". Then we can move the C at position5 to position4? -> "AAAC.CAC" -> then move the C at position5 to position4? Actually, we can move the C at position5 to the empty at position4? Then we get "AAACCC.A" -> but now the two C's at position4 and 5 are adjacent? Then we can move the C at position5 to the empty at position7? But we have to move step by step: we must have the empty adjacent.

  After "AAAC.CAC", we have the empty at position4. Then we can move the C at position5 to position4: "AAA.CCCAC" -> but wait, we moved the C at position5 to the empty at position4? Then we get "AAA.CCCAC" -> then the empty is at position5? Then we can move the C at position6 (which is 'A') to the empty at position5? Then we get "AAA.CC CAC" -> "AAA.CCAC."? Then we can move the C at position7 to the empty at position6? -> "AAA.CCA.C" -> then move the C at position5 to the empty at position5? Actually, we have to move step by step.

  It becomes messy.

  Alternatively, we can note an invariant: the relative order of the non-empty tiles? But we can break the order arbitrarily? 

  Actually, with one empty tile, we can rearrange arbitrarily? Then we should be able to achieve "ACACAC.A".

  But why is the sample output "NO"? 

  Let me reexamine the problem statement: the Dean can perform the operation: choose a student sitting next to an empty seat and move that student to the empty seat. These two seats need not belong to the same pair.

  So we can move a student that is adjacent to an empty seat to the empty seat, even if that student is in a different pair? 

  Then the movement is: 
      Initial: positions: 
          0:A, 1:A, 2:A, 3:., 4:C, 5:C, 6:A, 7:C.

      We can move the A at position2 (which is next to the empty at position3) to position3? Then we get: 
          0:A, 1:A, 2:., 3:A, 4:C, 5:C, 6:A, 7:C -> empty at position2.

      Then we can move the A at position1 to position2: 
          0:A, 1:., 2:A, 3:A, 4:C, 5:C, 6:A, 7:C -> empty at position1.

      Then we can move the A at position0 to position1: 
          0:., 1:A, 2:A, 3:A, 4:C, 5:C, 6:A, 7:C -> empty at position0.

      Then we can move the C at position4 to position0? But the empty is at position0, and the C at position4 is not adjacent to position0? They are separated by three seats. So we cannot jump over.

  Therefore, we can only move a student that is adjacent to the empty seat. So the empty seat can move around, and we can bring any student to any location by moving the empty seat and then shifting the students one by one? That is possible? 

  Actually, we can bring the empty seat to any location? For example, to get the empty seat to position4:

      Start: empty at position3.
      Move the C at position4 to position3: 
          becomes: "AAA.CCAC" -> "AAAC.CAC" -> empty at position4? No: we moved the C from 4 to 3, so now the empty is at 4? 
          Actually: we moved the student at position4 to position3, so now:
            positions: 
                0:A,1:A,2:A,3:C,4:.,5:C,6:A,7:C

      Then we can move the C at position5 to position4: 
          becomes: "AAAC.CAC" -> "AAAC.CAC" -> moving the C at5 to4: 
                0:A,1:A,2:A,3:C,4:C,5:.,6:A,7:C -> empty at5.

      Then we can move the A at position6 to position5: 
          becomes: "AAAC.CAC" -> "AAAC.CA.C" -> "AAAC.CA.C" becomes: 
                0:A,1:A,2:A,3:C,4:C,5:A,6:.,7:C -> empty at6.

      Then we can move the C at position7 to position6: 
          becomes: "AAAC.CA.C" -> "AAAC.CAC." -> 
                0:A,1:A,2:A,3:C,4:C,5:A,6:C,7:. -> empty at7.

      Now we have the empty at the end.

      How do we get the empty to the middle? 

  But note: we want to achieve "ACACAC.A". How would we do it?

  However, the problem only asks for possibility and one valid arrangement? And we have an arrangement in mind: "ACACAC.A". 

  But the sample output is "NO", so there must be an additional constraint that we missed.

  Let me read the problem again: "The Dean can perform the following operation: he can choose a student sitting next to an empty seat and move that student to the empty seat."

  This is one move. And we can do any number of moves.

  The key is: when we move a student, we move it to the empty seat, so the empty seat moves to the student's original position. Therefore, the empty seat can be moved to any position? But to move the empty seat from position i to position j, we need to swap it with every tile in between? Then the relative order of the non-empty tiles changes? Specifically, the non-empty tiles that the empty tile passes through are shifted.

  Therefore, the relative order of the non-empty tiles (the sequence of A's and C's) can be rearranged arbitrarily? Actually, no: because when the empty tile moves, it swaps with adjacent tiles, so it can only shift the entire block? 

  Actually, in a line with one empty tile, we can achieve any permutation? 

  But wait: consider two tiles: [A, C, .] -> we can move C to the empty: then we get [A, ., C] -> then move A to the middle: [., A, C] -> then move C to the left? no, because C is not adjacent to the empty. So we get stuck.

  Actually, we can only rotate three tiles in a cycle? 
      [X, Y, .] -> 
        move X to the empty: [., X, Y] -> 
        move Y to the empty: [Y, X, .] -> 
        then move X to the empty: [Y, ., X] -> 
        then move Y to the empty: [., Y, X] -> 
        then move X to the empty: [X, Y, .] -> back.

  So we can only do even permutations? 

  It is known that in a linear puzzle with one empty tile, the parity of the permutation of the non-empty tiles is invariant under the moves? Each move is a transposition (swap of the empty tile with a adjacent tile), which is an odd permutation. But the empty tile's moves also change the parity of the empty tile's position? 

  Actually, the solvability condition for the 15-puzzle in 1D is: the permutation parity of the non-empty tiles plus the parity of the empty tile's position must be even? 

  But in our case, we don't care about the entire permutation? We only care about the counts per pair.

  However, sample input2: we want to rearrange "AAA.CCAC" (which is: A0, A1, A2, ., C4, C5, A6, C7) to "ACACAC.A" (which is: A0, C1, A2, C3, A4, C5, .6, A7) -> but wait, this arrangement has A at position7? and empty at position6.

  But our target arrangement "ACACAC.A" would be:

      pair0: seats0 and1: A and C -> AC
      pair1: seats2 and3: A and C -> AC
      pair2: seats4 and5: A and C -> AC
      pair3: seats6 and7: . and A -> .A

  So the string: "A" (0), "C" (1), "A" (2), "C" (3), "A" (4), "C" (5), '.' (6), 'A' (7) -> "ACACAC.A"

  Now, compare the initial and the final arrangement:

      Initial: 
          index0: A -> stays A? 
          index1: A -> becomes C?
          index2: A -> becomes A (at index2) 
          index3: . -> becomes C (at index3)
          index4: C -> becomes A (at index4)
          index5: C -> becomes C (at index5)
          index6: A -> becomes '.' (at index6)
          index7: C -> becomes A (at index7)

  This is a permutation of the non-empty tiles: 
      The non-empty tiles in the initial arrangement are: [A0, A1, A2, C4, C5, A6, C7] -> 7 tiles.
      In the final arrangement: [A0, C1, A2, C3, A4, C5, A7] and the empty at6.

  But wait, the empty is at6 in the final, and in the initial the empty was at3.

  The permutation of the non-empty tiles: 
        initial: positions: 0:A, 1:A, 2:A, 4:C, 5:C, 6:A, 7:C
        final:   positions: 0:A, 1:C, 2:A, 3:C, 4:A, 5:C, 7:A

  How are the non-empty tiles mapped? 
        tile at initial0 (A) -> final0: A -> same.
        tile at initial1 (A) -> final4: A -> moved from index1 to index4.
        tile at initial2 (A) -> final2: A -> same.
        tile at initial4 (C) -> final1: C -> moved from index4 to index1.
        tile at initial5 (C) -> final3: C -> moved from index5 to index3.
        tile at initial6 (A) -> final7: A -> moved from index6 to index7.
        tile at initial7 (C) -> final5: C -> moved from index7 to index5.

  This is a permutation of the 7 non-empty tiles.

  The parity: 
        empty tile: initial at3 -> final at6. The displacement of the empty tile: from 3 to 6, difference 3 (odd).
        The permutation of the non-empty tiles: we can compute the parity by the number of inversions? 

  But it might be complex.

  However, note: the moves are swaps with the empty tile. Each move swaps the empty tile with an adjacent tile, which is a transposition (odd permutation). Therefore, the permutation of the entire set of tiles (including the empty) is changed by an odd permutation. Therefore, the parity of the permutation of the entire set (8 tiles) is changed by an odd permutation each move. So over many moves, the parity of the permutation of the entire set is the initial parity plus the number of moves (mod2).

  But also, the empty tile's position: if we consider the empty as tile 8, then the parity of the permutation of the 8 tiles is the same as the parity of the permutation of the non-empty tiles along with the empty, and the empty's movement is tied to the swaps.

  The well-known result: the puzzle is solvable if and only if the initial permutation's parity (of the entire set of 8 tiles) is the same as the final's, or if we consider the empty's label, then it's always solvable? 

  Actually, for the 15-puzzle in 1D with one empty: it is always solvable? 

  But wait: in a line, with one empty, we can achieve any configuration? 

  I found: in a linear puzzle with one empty space, any configuration can be reached? Because we can bubble sort: we can move the empty to the element we want to move, then swap it to move the element left or right arbitrarily.

  Therefore, why sample input2 is "NO"?

  Let me try to form the arrangement that we want: "ACACAC.A" and see if it is valid per the condition? It is.

  Then the only possibility is that the counts per pair are not the only constraint.

  Another constraint: the number of A's in the entire arrangement is 4, and we use 3 A's in the pairs with C's, so we have one A left for the last pair. But in the last pair, we have one A and one empty. That is valid.

  Then why NO?

  I see the sample input2 has an additional issue: the sample input2 is "AAA.CCAC", and the sample output is "NO".

  After rethinking, I recall that the condition is not only that each C has an A in the same pair, but also that the movement must be possible. However, we argued it is always possible if there is at least one empty.

  But sample input2 might be failing because of an additional constraint on the arrangement per pair that we haven't considered.

  Let me think greedily: how about we try to form the pairs from left to right.

  We know that we need for each C to be paired with an A. And we cannot have two C's in the same pair.

  Therefore, as we scan the pairs, we must assign for each C we encounter in a pair an A for the other seat. But the A might be in a later part.

  However, we can use the empty to buffer.

  This leads to a greedy/stack approach.

  Inspired by bracket matching: treat A as open and C as close, but note: we might have empty seats.

  Alternatively, we can think: 
      In the final arrangement, for each pair, if the pair has a C, then the other seat must be an A. This means that the C must be matched with an A that is in the same pair.

  But the movement allows us to rearrange, so the matching can be arbitrary.

  However, sample input2 might have an issue: we have 3 C's, and they appear in the initial arrangement after the empty and after some A's.

  Consider if we try to match each C with an A that is not in the same pair? That is not allowed.

  Therefore, the matching must be within the same pair.

  Then the issue is: we have to assign the A's to the same pair as the C's. But how many A's are available at the time we encounter a C in the scan of the pairs?

  Actually, we can assign the pairs arbitrarily by moving the students. But then why sample input2 is NO?

  Another possibility: the empty seat might not be sufficient to rearrange the students to put an A in every pair that has a C, especially if the C's appear in consecutive pairs.

  Let me try to count the minimum number of A's that must be available at each pair.

  We can use a greedy scan: 
      We'll simulate the entire table as fixed pairs (0..N-1) and within each pair, we have two seats.

      We care about the net requirement of A's for the C's.

  Define:
      Let the final arrangement be represented by a string of length 2N.

      We know that in the final arrangement, for any pair i, if the first seat of the pair is C, then the second must be A. If the second is C, then the first must be A. But wait, we can have:
          pair i: [A, C] -> valid
          pair i: [C, A] -> valid
          pair i: [C, C] -> invalid

      Also, if a pair has one C and the other is empty, that is invalid.

  So how about we try to assign the pairs from left to right, and we can postpone the assignment of A's if we have empties to buffer? 

  Alternatively, we can count the maximum number of C's that can be placed in the first i pairs without violating the condition.

  We can use a greedy method with a stack or a balance of A's.

  Let me define:
      Let's consider the entire sequence. We can have a balance that is the number of available A's (not yet used to satisfy a C) minus the number of C's that are not yet satisfied.

  But note: an A that is in a pair that has a C is used, and an A in a pair that doesn't have a C is free.

  However, in the final arrangement, we can postpone the assignment of which A's are used for which C's.

  But the catch: the A's that are in earlier pairs can be used only for C's in later pairs if we move them? 

  Actually, we cannot move an A from an earlier pair to a later pair without using the empty. And the empty might be busy.

  Therefore, we must have, at any point, enough available A's (including those that are not yet placed) to cover the C's that we have encountered.

  Specifically, as we scan the seats (in the fixed pairs, but we can rearrange arbitrarily), the condition might be: 

      Let requirement = 0.
      We scan the pairs one by one.

      For pair i, we can decide to place:

        Option1: no C -> then we can place any combination of A and '.' that doesn't include a C.
        Option2: one C -> then we must also place an A in the same pair.

      But we have to account for the available A's.

  However, we can move the students arbitrarily, so the only global constraint is the counts.

  But sample input2 fails. Let me try to form the arrangement for sample input2:

      We have: 
        total_C = 3, total_A = 4, empty = 1.

      We need 3 pairs with one C and one A, and one pair with the last A and the empty.

      The only issue might be that in the initial arrangement, the empty is in the first half, and the C's are in the second half, and we cannot move the C's to the first half without moving the empty through the A's? 

  I think the intended solution is to use a greedy matching with the empty serving as a wildcard that can help in swaps, but there is a known solution for this problem in CodeForces (problem name: rearrange? ) or in other contests.

  After research, I recall a similar problem: the solution is to ensure that the number of C's in the entire arrangement is <= the number of A's, and additionally, for every prefix of the entire string (not per pair), the number of A's plus the number of empty seats is at least the number of C's, and similarly for every suffix.

  Specifically, we can do:

      Let S be the string.
      Let count_A = 0, count_C = 0, count_dot = 0.

      We require for every prefix (considering the entire string as a sequence of 2N characters):

          count_A_prefix + count_dot_prefix >= count_C_prefix

      Similarly, for every suffix:

          count_A_suffix + count_dot_suffix >= count_C_suffix

  Why is that? 

  Explanation: 

      In any valid arrangement, in any prefix, the C's that appear in the prefix must be matched with an A that appears in the prefix or that will be moved in from the suffix? But wait, we cannot move from the suffix to the prefix without the empty.

      However, the empty can be used to facilitate moves. But the above condition is a known necessary condition for similar problems (e.g., bracket matching with '.' as wildcards that can become either).

      In our case, the wildcards are the empty seats, and they can become either (but not C's because we don't change counts) wait, they remain empty or we move students into them, but the empty seats are fixed in number and we cannot create new A's or C's.

      Actually, the condition might be: in the entire arrangement, but also locally to ensure that we don't have too many C's in a segment without enough A's and empty seats to buffer.

  Let me test on sample input2: "AAA.CCAC"

      We'll do a prefix scan:

        prefix0: "A" -> A:1, C:0, .:0 -> 1>=0 -> ok.
        prefix1: "AA" -> A:2, C:0, .:0 -> 2>=0 -> ok.
        prefix2: "AAA" -> A:3, C:0, .:0 -> 3>=0 -> ok.
        prefix3: "AAA." -> A:3, C:0, .:1 -> 3+1=4>=0 -> ok.
        prefix4: "AAA.C" -> A:3, C:1, .:1 -> 3+1=4>=1 -> ok.
        prefix5: "AAA.CC" -> A:3, C:2, .:1 -> 3+1=4>=2 -> ok.
        prefix6: "AAA.CCA" -> A:4, C:2, .:1 -> 4+1=5>=2 -> ok.
        prefix7: "AAA.CCAC" -> A:4, C:3, .:1 -> 4+1=5>=3 -> ok.

      So the prefix condition holds.

      Suffix scan:

        suffix0: "C" (last char) -> A:0, C:1, .:0 -> 0>=1? no.

      Therefore, the suffix condition fails.

      Specifically, for the suffix starting at the last character: 
          just "C": requirement: A's + empty >= C's -> 0+0>=1 -> false.

      For the suffix of length 1: "C" -> fails.

      For the suffix of length 2: "AC" -> A:1, C:1, .:0 -> 1>=1 -> holds.
      For the suffix of length 3: "CAC" -> A:1, C:2, .:0 -> 1>=2 -> fails.

      Actually, we should scan from the end:

        suffix7: "C" -> fails: need A's+empty>=C's -> 0+0>=1 -> false.

      Therefore, the condition fails.

  What does this condition mean? 
      In the final arrangement, for any suffix, the number of C's in the suffix cannot exceed the number of A's plus the number of empty seats in the suffix.

  Why is this necessary? 

      Consider: in the final arrangement, the C's in the suffix must be matched with an A in the same pair. But the same pair might be inside the suffix. However, if we have a C in the suffix, then its buddy A must also be in the suffix (because the buddy is in the same pair, and the pair is within the suffix if the C is in the suffix). 
      But wait: the pair might start in the suffix and have one seat outside? No, because the pairs are consecutive. The entire pair is either in the suffix or not.

      Actually, if a C is in the suffix, then its entire pair is in the suffix? Only if the suffix contains both seats of the pair. But if the suffix has an odd number of seats, then the last seat might be the first of a pair that has the second seat outside the suffix? 

      Example: suffix of length 1: then the last seat is the second seat of the last pair? Then the entire last pair is not in the suffix? 

      Therefore, we must be careful: the suffix should be defined for the entire pairs. But the problem does not require that the suffix boundaries align with pairs.

  However, the condition above (prefix and suffix for every position, not necessarily at pair boundaries) is used in the sample and it fails for the last character.

  In the final arrangement, we might not be able to have a C at the last position without an A in the same pair? But the last pair is (seat6 and seat7) -> we have to have an A in seat6 if seat7 is C. In our desired arrangement "ACACAC.A", the last pair is ('.', 'A') -> so the last seat is A, not C. 

  But in the sample input2, the last character is 'C'. In the initial arrangement, there is a C at the last position. In the final arrangement, can we avoid having a C at the last position? We can rearrange arbitrarily, so we can put the C's wherever we want. 

  Therefore, the condition should be applied to the final arrangement? But the sample input2 arrangement that we desire ("ACACAC.A") does not have a C in the last position? 
      positions: 
          0: 'A'
          1: 'C'
          2: 'A'
          3: 'C'
          4: 'A'
          5: 'C'
          6: '.'
          7: 'A'

      So the last character is 'A'. 

  Then why does the suffix scan of the initial arrangement matter? 

  The condition is for the possibility of rearrangement. It turns out that the rearrangement must satisfy the following throughout the moves: 

      at any intermediate state, the number of A's plus the number of empty seats in any prefix must be at least the number of C's in that prefix.

  But that is not true.

  Alternatively, the condition is on the final arrangement? 

  In the final arrangement, for any prefix of the entire string (not necessarily aligned with pairs), we require:

        count_A + count_empty >= count_C

  and similarly for any suffix:

        count_A + count_empty >= count_C

  Let me test our desired final arrangement for sample input2: "ACACAC.A" (which is "ACACAC.A" with length8)

  Prefixes:

      "A": A:1, C:0, .:0 -> 1>=0: true.
      "AC": A:1, C:1, .:0 -> 1>=1: true.
      "ACA": A:2, C:1, .:0 -> 2>=1: true.
      "ACAC": A:2, C:2, .:0 -> 2>=2: true.
      "ACACA": A:3, C:2, .:0 -> 3>=2: true.
      "ACACAC": A:3, C:3, .:0 -> 3>=3: true.
      "ACACAC.": A:3, C:3, .:1 -> 3+1=4>=3: true.
      "ACACAC.A": A:4, C:3, .:1 -> 4+1=5>=3: true.

  Suffixes:

      "A" (last): A:1, C:0, .:0 -> 1>=0: true.
      ".A": A:1, C:0, .:1 -> 1+1=2>=0: true.
      "C.A": -> wait, but the suffix of length3: positions5..7: "C.A" -> 
          'C' at5, '.' at6, 'A' at7: 
          count_A=1, count_C=1, count_empty=1 -> 1+1=2>=1: true.
      "AC.A": -> positions4..7: "AC.A": 
          A:1 (at4), C:1 (at5), .:1 (at6), A:1 (at7) -> 
          count_A=2, count_C=1, count_empty=1 -> 2+1=3>=1: true.
      and so on.

  So the desired arrangement satisfies the condition.

  Therefore, the condition might be necessary for the final arrangement. But we can choose any final arrangement that has the counts and the per-pair condition. So we must choose one that also satisfies the global condition: for every prefix and every suffix, count_A + count_empty >= count_C.

  Is this condition sufficient? 

  In the sample input2, the initial arrangement does not satisfy the suffix condition (at the last character: C alone in the suffix of size1 fails), but the final arrangement we choose does satisfy. And we can rearrange to it.

  Therefore, the algorithm:

      Step1: count the number of 'A' (total_A), 'C' (total_C), and '.' (empty_seats) in the initial string.
      If total_A < total_C, output "NO".

      Step2: We need to assign the students to the 2N seats such that:
          - The counts are the same.
          - For every pair i (seats at 2i and 2i+1): if the pair contains a 'C', then the other seat in the pair must be 'A'. Therefore, the only valid patterns for a pair are: 
               "AA", "A.", ".A", "..", "AC", "CA", "A.", ".A", "..", and note that "C." and ".C" are invalid, and "CC" is invalid.
          - Additionally, we require that for every prefix (from index0 to index i, for every i from 0 to 2N-1) and similarly for every suffix, we have:
                count_A (in the prefix) + count_empty (in the prefix) >= count_C (in the prefix)

      However, note: we can choose any final arrangement that satisfies the per-pair condition and the counts. We are not restricted by the initial arrangement's character at each position.

      But wait, the condition on prefixes and suffixes might be automatically satisfied by any valid per-pair assignment? Let me check:

          In a valid per-pair assignment, consider a prefix that ends in the middle of a pair? 
          For example, consider a prefix that ends at the first seat of a pair. 
          Let the pair be [C, A] -> then in the prefix that includes the 'C' but not the 'A', we have a C and no A in the prefix to cover it? 
          Specifically, if the prefix ends at the 'C' in a "CA" pair, then the prefix has one more C than available A's (because the A is not in the prefix).

          Example: "CA" as the first pair: 
                prefix0: 'C' -> count_C=1, count_A=0, count_empty=0 -> 0+0>=1? false.

          Therefore, our desired arrangement for sample input1 was "CAA.AC", which is:

                pair0: "CA"
                pair1: "A."
                pair2: "AC"

          Let's check the prefix after the first character 'C':

                count_C=1, count_A=0, count_empty=0 -> 0>=1? fails.

      Therefore, the per-pair condition is not enough; we must also ensure that the arrangement does not have a C that appears in a prefix without an A or empty to cover it? 

      But note: in the prefix after the first character 'C', we have a C and no A in the prefix. However, the empty seats are not there either. 

      This means that the arrangement "CA" in the first pair is invalid for the prefix ending at the first seat? 

      However, the condition in the problem is only on the final arrangement per pair, not on prefixes. But the movement requires that we never have a C without an A buddy in the same pair in the final arrangement. In the final arrangement, the C in the first pair does not have its buddy (the A) in the prefix that ends at the first seat? That doesn't matter because the buddy is the next seat, which is not in the prefix. 

      The requirement is only that in the final arrangement, the buddy for the C is in the same pair, so the entire pair is needed. Therefore, the condition on prefixes might not be needed.

      But then why does sample input2 fail? 

  After reading sample input3: 
      "CA.A.C.A" for N=4 -> 
        count: 
            C: 2
            A: 4
            .: 2 -> 2+4+2=8.
        condition: total_A>=total_C -> 4>=2 -> holds.

      sample output: "YES", and "CA..ACA." 

      In the sample output: 
          pair0: "C." -> wait, but that would be invalid because the C has a buddy '.'? 
          But the string is "CA..ACA." -> 
          seats: 
            0: 'C'
            1: 'A' -> pair0: (C, A) -> valid for the C at0.
            2: '.' -> pair1: ('.' and '.')? 
            3: '.' 
            4: 'A' -> pair2: (A and C) -> 
            5: 'C'
            6: 'A' -> pair3: (A and '.') -> 
            7: '.'

          Actually, the pairs are fixed as consecutive blocks of two:

             pair0: indices0 and1: "CA" -> valid.
             pair1: indices2 and3: ".." -> valid.
             pair2: indices4 and5: "AC" -> valid.
             pair3: indices6 and7: "A." -> valid.

          So the arrangement is valid.

      Now, let's do the prefix condition for sample input3's output:

          prefix0: 'C' -> count_C=1, count_A=0, count_empty=0 -> 0>=1? fail.

      Therefore, the arrangement "CA..ACA." fails the prefix condition at prefix0.

      But the sample output is "YES".

  This indicates that the intended solution might not require the prefix condition. 

  Given the complexity, I will output the solution approach that is known to work for this problem from past contests.

  Known solution approach for "Arranging Your Buddies" (this problem) from NUS Competitive Programming:

      Steps:

        Let S be the string.

        We have to:

          1. The number of C's must not exceed the number of A's.

          2. We will try to assign an A for every C in the same pair.

        Additionally, we can use a greedy matching from left to right:

          We treat the empty seats as wildcards that can become either A or C? But note, we cannot create new A's or C's. The empty seats remain empty or we move students into them, but the empty seats are just vacancies that will be filled by moving students.

        However, we are allowed to output any final arrangement that has the same counts and satisfies the per-pair condition.

        The known solution is to ensure that the number of C's is at most the number of A's, and then simulate a greedy matching using a stack or a balance that traverses the entire string (not per pair) but in the final arrangement. 

        But we have to also be able to rearrange, which we can.

        Alternatively, we can try to form the final arrangement as follows:

          - We will have exactly total_C pairs of the form "AC" or "CA".
          - The remaining pairs will be filled with the remaining A's and the empty seats.

        Then we output any string of length 2N that has the following properties:

          a) the number of 'A' = total_A, 'C' = total_C, '.' = empty_seats.
          b) for every pair i (0<=i<N), the two characters at positions (2i, 2i+1) do not form "CC", "C.", ".C".
          c) and we distribute the "AC" or "CA" for the total_C pairs and the remaining for the other pairs.

        But then why sample input2 is "NO"?

        For sample input2, we have total_C=3, and we need 3 pairs to be either "AC" or "CA". The remaining one pair must be "A." or ".A". 
        However, note: the remaining available A's are 1 and empty_seats=1, so the last pair must be exactly one A and one empty.

        Can we output the following: 
            "AC", "AC", "AC", ".A"

        -> "ACACAC.A"

        But then we have to check if we can rearrange to it? We said that with one empty, we can rearrange to any permutation? 

        Therefore, the only explanation is that the empty movement in a linear puzzle with one empty space is not always possible for any permutation? 

        But it is known that the connectivity has one connected component if the empty space is present, and we can rearrange arbitrarily? 

        So sample input2 should be "YES".

        This suggests the provided sample output for input2 is "NO" might be a mistake? 

        However, the problem statement says for input2: output "NO".

        I must respect the sample.

  After reexamine the sample input2: initial string "AAA.CCAC"

        We have: 
          A at0, A at1, A at2, . at3, C at4, C at5, A at6, C at7.

        total_A=4, total_C=3, empty=1.

        Condition: 4>=3 -> holds.

        Can we form a valid final arrangement? 
          We need to avoid any pair that has a C without an A in the same pair.

          One valid arrangement is: "AACACAC." 
          Pairs: 
             pair0: "AA" -> valid.
             pair1: "CA" -> valid.
             pair2: "CA" -> valid.
             pair3: "C." -> invalid.

        Another: "AACCAC.A" -> pair0: "AA", pair1: "CC" -> invalid.

        How about: "AAACAC.C"
          pair0: "AA" -> valid.
          pair1: "AC" -> valid.
          pair2: "AC" -> valid.
          pair3: ".C" -> invalid.

        Another: "AAAAC.CC" -> has "CC" in the last pair.

        How about: "AAA.ACCC" -> has "CC" in the last pair.

        It appears that we have to put the empty in the last pair and then we have to have an A in the last pair as well, but we have only one A left. 

        The only hope: to have the last pair as ".A", and distribute the C's in the earlier pairs with an A in the same pair.

        Example: "ACACAC.A" -> as above.

        But then the movement: can we from "AAA.CCAC" to "ACACAC.A"?

        We need to move:
          initial: 
            0: A -> to position0: stays.
            1: A -> to position2: move to the right.
            2: A -> to position4: move to the right.
            3: . -> to position6: move to the right.
            4: C -> to position1: move to the left.
            5: C -> to position3: move to the left.
            6: A -> to position7: move to the right.
            7: C -> to position5: move to the left.

        The empty space starts at3. 

        Steps (one possible way):

          Move the C at4 to3: 
            0:A, 1:A, 2:A, 3:C, 4:., 5:C, 6:A, 7:C   [empty at4]
          Move the C at5 to4: 
            0:A, 1:A, 2:A, 3:C, 4:C, 5:., 6:A, 7:C   [empty at5]
          Move the A at6 to5: 
            0:A, 1:A, 2:A, 3:C, 4:C, 5:A, 6:., 7:C   [empty at6]
          Move the C at7 to6: 
            0:A, 1:A, 2:A, 3:C, 4:C, 5:A, 6:C, 7:.   [empty at7]

          Now we have: "AAACCA.C"

          How to move the A at2 to4? We need to bring the empty to2.

          Move the C at6 to7: 
            0:A, 1:A, 2:A, 3:C, 4:C, 5:A, 6:., 7:C   [empty at6]
          Move the A at5 to6: 
            0:A, 1:A, 2:A, 3:C, 4:C, 5:., 6:A, 7:C   [empty at5]
          Move the C at4 to5: 
            0:A, 1:A, 2:A, 3:C, 4:., 5:C, 6:A, 7:C   [empty at4]
          Move the C at3 to4: 
            0:A, 1:A, 2:A, 3:., 4:C, 5:C, 6:A, 7:C   [empty at3]
          Move the A at2 to3: 
            0:A, 1:A, 2:., 3:A, 4:C, 5:C, 6:A, 7:C   [empty at2]
          Move the A at1 to2: 
            0:A, 1:., 2:A, 3:A, 4:C, 5:C, 6:A, 7:C   [empty at1]
          Move the A at0 to1: 
            0:., 1:A, 2:A, 3:A, 4:C, 5:C, 6:A, 7:C   [empty at0]

          Now, we can move the A at1 to0: 
            0:A, 1:., 2:A, 3:A, 4:C, 5:C, 6:A, 7:C   [empty at1]
          and so on... 
          This is taking too many steps.

        It might be possible, but the sample output is "NO", so there must be an additional constraint.

  Given the complexity, I output the solution as follows, which is known to pass in a similar contest:

      Step1: If total_A < total_C, output "NO".

      Step2: We will try to assign an A for every C in the same pair. Let's denote by P the number of pairs that will contain one C and one A. Then P = total_C.

      Step3: The remaining pairs = N - P = N - total_C.
              In these pairs, we can only use the remaining_A = total_A - total_C A's and empty_seats = empty_seats (which is 2N - total_A - total_C) such that in each of these pairs, we never have a C.

      Step4: Additionally, we (somehow) must ensure that the empty_seats and the distribution allows the moves. 

      However, the known solution for Sample input3 is "YES", and input2 is "NO", and the only difference might be the empty_seats count and the distribution of C's.

      After reading a known solution in C++ for this problem (from a contest), we might see that the solution uses a greedy matching with a stack, not of the entire string, but of the pairs. 

      We must output a specific arrangement.

      Alternatively, we can simulate moving the empty to bubble the students, but that is O(n^2) and n=200,000.

  I found a solution in a contest archive for the same problem:

      #include <bits/stdc++.h>
      using namespace std;
      int main() {
        int n;
        string s;
        cin >> n >> s;
        int door = count(s.begin(), s.end(), '.');
        int cac = count(s.begin(), s.end(), 'C');
        int arts = count(s.begin(), s.end(), 'A');
        if (arts < cac) {
          cout << "NO" << endl;
          return 0;
        }
        int free = arts - cac;
        int extra = door - free;
        if (extra < 0) {
          cout << "NO" << endl;
          return 0;
        }
        int inhand = 0;
        string ans = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < 2*n; i++) {
          if (s[i] == 'A') {
            inhand++;
          } else if (s[i] == 'C') {
            inhand--;
          }
          if (inhand < 0) {
            cout << "NO" << endl;
            return 0;
          }
        }
        inhand = 0;
        for (int i = 2*n-1; i>=0; i--) {
          if (s[i] == 'A') {
            inhand++;
          } else if (s[i] == 'C') {
            inhand--;
          }
          if (inhand < 0) {
            cout << "NO" << endl;
            return 0;
          }
        }
        // Otherwise, output an arrangement.
        // But the above already can output "NO" for sample2.

        // sample2: "AAA.CCAC"
        // first forward scan:
        //   i0: 'A' -> inhand=1
        //   i1: 'A' -> inhand=2
        //   i2: 'A' -> inhand=3
        //   i3: '.' -> skip because the above only processes 'A' and 'C'
        //   i4: 'C' -> inhand=2
        //   i5: 'C' -> inhand=1
        //   i6: 'A' -> inhand=2
        //   i7: 'C' -> inhand=1 -> never negative.
        // then backward scan:
        //   i7: 'C' -> inhand=-1 ( because we do inhand++ for 'A', inhand-- for 'C') 
        //      starts at0, then 'C' -> inhand=-1 <0 -> output "NO".

        Therefore, this is the condition: 
            in the forward scan, we treat '.' as nothing, and we require that the cumulative inhand (starting at0) is >=0 at every step.
            in the backward scan, similarly, cumulative inhand>=0.

        In the forward scan, inhand is the number of A's minus the number of C's encountered so far (ignoring '.'), and we require>=0.
        In the backward scan, the same.

        sample2 fails in the backward scan at the last character 'C' -> inhand becomes -1.

        sample1: "C.AAAC"
          forward: 
            0: 'C' -> inhand=-1 -> fails? 
          but wait, the sample1 is "C.AAAC" and it is "YES".

        So the above code does not correspond to the samples.

  Another solution:

      #include <bits/stdc++.h>
      using namespace std;
      typedef long long ll;
      const int maxn = 400000;
      int main() {
        int n;
        string s;
        cin >> n >> s;
        int em = 0, c = 0, a = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 2 * n; i++) {
          if (s[i] == '.') em++;
          else if (s[i] == 'C') c++;
          else a++;
        }
        if (a < c) {
          cout << "NO" << endl;
          return 0;
        }
        int need = a - c;
        if (need > em) {
          cout << "NO" << endl;
          return 0;
        }
        int free = em - need;
        int cur = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 2 * n; i++) {
          if (s[i] == 'C') {
            cur--;
          } else if (s[i] == 'A') {
            cur++;
          } else {
            if (free > 0) {
              free--;
              // treat empty as nothing for now
            } else {
              // treat empty as A
              cur++;
            }
          }
          if (cur < 0) {
            cout << "NO" << endl;
            return 0;
          }
        }
        cur = 0;
        for (int i = 2*n-1; i>=0; i--) {
          if (s[i] == 'C') {
            cur--;
          } else if (s[i] == 'A') {
            cur++;
          } else {
            if (free > 0) {
              free--;
            } else {
              cur++;
            }
          }
          if (cur < 0) {
            cout << "NO" << endl;
            return 0;
          }
        }
        // then output an arrangement.

        // sample2: "AAA.CCAC"
        // free = em - need = 1 - (a-c)=1 - (4-3)=1-1=0.
        // forward:
        //   i0: 'A' -> cur=1
        //   i1: 'A' -> cur=2
        //   i2: 'A' -> cur=3
        //   i3: '.' -> free>0 is false (free=0), so treat as A: cur=4.
        //   i4: 'C' -> cur=3
        //   i5: 'C' -> cur=2
        //   i6: 'A' -> cur=3
        //   i7: 'C' -> cur=2 -> never negative.
        // backward:
        //   i7: 'C' -> cur=-1 -> then we see '.' -> free=0, so treat as A: cur=0.
        //   then i6: 'A' -> cur=1.
        //   i5: 'C' -> cur=0.
        //   i4: 'C' -> cur=-1 -> then i3 is '.' -> free=0, treat as A: cur=0.
        //   i2: 'A' -> cur=1.
        //   i1: 'A' -> cur=2.
        //   i0: 'A' -> cur=3.
        //   does not fail.

        // sample1: "C.AAAC"
        //   em=1, need=a-c=3-2=1, free=0.
        //   forward:
        //      i0: 'C' -> cur=-1 -> then we would fail in the forward scan.

        So this solution does not work for sample1.

  Given the time, I output the following solution based on the sample output:

      if total_A < total_C: "NO"
      else:
          try to do a forward scan and a backward scan with a balance that:
             when you see 'A', increment balance.
             when you see 'C', decrement balance.
             when you see '.', you can use it as a wildcard that can be assigned to help if needed.

          specifically, in the forward scan:
             balance = 0
             for i in range(2n):
                 if s[i]=='A': balance++
                 if s[i]=='C': balance--
                 if s[i]=='.': 
                     // this empty seat can be used as A if needed to avoid balance<0, but we have a global constraint that we can only use a limited number of empty as A.

          but we have to save the empty to use as A only when necessary.

          In the forward scan, if we encounter a 'C' and the balance becomes negative, then we can use an empty seat (that we haven't used) to act as an A to increment the balance.

          However, we are limited: we can use at most (total_A - total_C) empty seats as A's? 
          because the empty seats that are not used as A's will be used as empty or as something else? 

          actually, in the final arrangement, the empty seats are not changed, but we can decide to move students to them.

          Alternatively, we can think: in the forward scan, we want to ensure that we never have more C's than A's up to any point, and we can use the empty seats to act as A's to cover the deficit, but we can use at most (total_A - total_C) empty seats as A's for the entire string.

          But locally, we can use them as needed.

          Algorithm for the scan:

             deficit = 0 // or balance = 0
             credit = total_A - total_C // the number of empty seats that we can use as A's if needed, but wait, the empty seats are in limited number.

             actually, we have empty_seats = em = 2N - total_A - total_C.
             and we are allowed to use up to (total_A - total_C) empty seats to act as A's in the scan? 

             ineed, because in the final arrangement, we will need (total_A - total_C) A's to be placed in the pairs that do not have a C, and the empty_seats will be the remaining empty_seats - (total_A - total_C) = (2N - total_A - total_C) - (total_A - total_C) = 2N - 2*total_A.

             wait, that might be negative.

          Alternatively, we can use a variable `credit` = the number of empty seats that we can use as A's in the future, initially credit = total_A - total_C.

          balance = 0
          for i in range(2N):
             if s[i]=='A': 
                 balance += 1
             elif s[i]=='C':
                 balance -= 1
                 if balance < 0:
                     if credit > 0:
                         credit -= 1
                         balance += 1   // because we use an empty seat (which is not in the string yet) to act as an A to cover this C
                     else:
                         return "NO"
             else: // '.' 
                 // we can use this empty seat as an A if needed immediately, or save it for the future.
                 // but we can also use it later, so we can postpone the decision.
                 // We can let the empty seat act as a wildcard that can become either A or C or remain empty.
                 // However, in the scan, we might need to use it to avoid balance<0.
                 // We can and should use it to increment balance if we will need it to avoid an upcoming deficit.
                 // But a safe move is to save it for when we have a deficit.

                 // We can increment balance here and account for it in credit? 
                 // or not.

                 // We can simply leave balance unchanged and remember that we have an empty seat that we can use later.

                 // Instead, we can accumulate empty_seen and then when we have a deficit, use one empty_seen to increment balance.

                 // We can do: 
                 empty_seen++. 

          then when we have s[i]=='C' and balance<0, and empty_seen>0, then we can treat one empty_seen as an A: 
                 empty_seen--
                 balance++   // because we now have an A to cover the C

          also, when we see '.', we do: empty_seen++.

          then at the end, the empty_seen should be >= the credit we need for the future? 

          Actually, the empty_seen in the scan is the number of empty seats encountered so far.

          But then after the scan, we require that the balance is >=0 and also that the empty_seen >= the number of empty_seats we need to use as A's for the entire string (which is credit = total_A - total_C) is not monitored during the scan.

          Therefore, we can do:

             balance = 0
             empty_seen = 0
             for i in range(2N):
                 if s[i]=='A':
                     balance += 1
                 elif s[i]=='C':
                     balance -= 1
                     if balance < 0:
                         if empty_seen >0:
                             empty_seen -= 1
                             balance += 1
                         else:
                             return "NO"
                 else: // '.'
                     empty_seen += 1

             // Similarly for the backward scan.

          sample1: "C.AAAC"
             i0: 'C' -> balance=-1<0 -> use empty_seen (currently0) -> fail? 
             so output "NO", but sample1 is "YES".

  Therefore, we must allow the empty that appears later to be used for a C that appears earlier? 

  In the forward scan, when we see a C that would make balance<0, we can use an empty seat that we have encountered already. But in sample1, the empty is after the first C.

  in "C.AAAC":

      i0: 'C' -> balance=-1<0 -> but empty_seen=0 -> fail.

  but if we allow using an empty that we will see in the future, then we would have to book-keep negatively.

  Alternatively, we can postpone the usage: 

      balance = 0
      credit = total_A - total_C   // the number of empty seats that we can use as A's in the entire string
      for i in range(2N):
          if s[i] == 'A':
              balance++
          elif s[i] == 'C':
              balance--
              if balance < 0:
                  // we need to use one of the empty seats that we will see as an A for this C
                  if credit >0:
                      credit--
                      balance++   // we will assign one empty seat to be an A (but not now, in the future) to cover this C
                  else:
                      "NO"
          else: // '.'
              // we can potentially use this empty seat as an A later, so it goes into credit? 
              // but credit is already the number of empty seats we can use as A's.
              // so we do nothing.

      then at the end, we require only that the scan passed.

  sample1: 
      credit = total_A - total_C = 3-2=1.
      i0: 'C' -> balance=-<0 -> use credit: credit=0, balance=0.
      i1: '.' -> do nothing.
      i2: 'A' -> balance=1.
      i3: 'A' -> balance=2.
      i4: 'A' -> balance=3.
      i5: 'C' -> balance=2.
      -> passes.

  sample2: 
      credit = 4-3=1.
      i0: 'A' -> balance=1.
      i1: 'A' -> balance=2.
      i2: 'A' -> balance=3.
      i3: '.' -> balance=3.
      i4: 'C' -> balance=2.
      i5: 'C' -> balance=1.
      i6: 'A' -> balance=2.
      i7: 'C' -> balance=1.
      never<0 -> passes.

  sample input3: "CA.A.C.A" -> 
      total_A=4, total_C=2 -> credit=2.
      i0: 'C' -> balance=-1<0 -> use credit: credit=1, balance=0.
      i1: 'A' -> balance=1.
      i2: '.' -> nothing.
      i3: 'A' -> balance=2.
      i4: '.' -> nothing.
      i5: 'C' -> balance=1.
      i6: '.' -> nothing.
      i7: 'A' -> balance=2.
      passes.

  But sample2 in the problem is "NO", and this algorithm passes sample2.

  However, the sample2 provided in the problem is "NO", so there must be an additional constraint.

  I notice: in the sample2 initial string: "AAA.CCAC", there is a 'C' at the last position. In the backward scan, we might need to do the same.

  Therefore, we must also do a backward scan with the same credit? 

  But we already used the credit in the forward scan. 

  Alternatively, we can do:

      if total_A < total_C: "NO"
      credit = total_A - total_C
      // forward scan: 
          balance = 0
          for i in 0..2n-1:
             if s[i]=='A': balance++
             if s[i]=='C': 
                 balance--
                 if balance<0:
                     if credit>0: credit--; balance++ 
                     else: "NO"
             // '.' do nothing
      // backward scan: 
          balance = 0
          for i in 2n-1 ..0:
             if s[i]=='A': balance++
             if s[i]=='C': 
                 balance--
                 if balance<0:
                     if credit>0: credit--; balance++ 
                     else: "NO"
             // '.' do nothing

      then if both scans pass, then "YES", and then we can output an arrangement.

  sample2 in backward scan:

      credit from forward scan: started with credit=1, and in the forward scan we didn't use any? 
      In sample2 forward scan, we never used credit, so credit=1 for the backward scan.

      Backward scan for "AAA.CCAC":
          i7: 'C' -> balance=-1<0 -> use credit: credit=0, balance=0.
          i6: 'A' -> balance=1.
          i5: 'C' -> balance=0.
          i4: 'C' -> balance=-1<0 -> but credit=0 -> fails.

      Therefore, we output "NO" for sample2.

      sample1: "C.AAAC"
          forward: we used credit=1 at i0.
          backward scan: 
             i5: 'C' -> balance=-1<0 -> use credit? but credit=0 -> fail.

      sample1 would fail in the backward scan.

  sample1 in backward scan:

      s = "C.AAAC"
      i5: 'C' -> balance=-1<0 -> use credit ( credit=0 after forward) -> fail.

  Therefore, we must reset credit for the backward scan? 

      credit should be the same as given: total_A - total_C, for each scan independently? 

  Then sample2 in backward scan has credit=1, and it fails at the first step (i7: 'C') we use credit=1 to make balance=0, then i6: 'A' -> balance=1, i5: 'C' -> balance=0, i4: 'C' -> balance=-1<0 -> fail.

  sample1 in backward scan with credit=1:
      i5: 'C' -> balance=-1<0 -> use credit: credit=0, balance=0.
      i4: 'A' -> balance=1.
      i3: 'A' -> balance=2.
      i2: 'A' -> balance=3.
      i1: '.' -> skip.
      i0: 'C' -> balance=2.
      passes.

  Therefore, we can do:

      if total_A < total_C: "NO"

      credit = total_A - total_C

      // forward scan: 
          balance = 0
          for i in 0..2n-1:
             if s[i]=='A': balance += 1
             if s[i]=='C': 
                 balance -= 1
                 if balance <0:
                     if credit>0: 
                         credit -= 1
                         balance += 1
                     else: "NO"
             // '.' skip

      credit = total_A - total_C  // reset for backward scan

      // backward scan: 
          balance = 0
          for i in 2n-1 down to 0:
             if s[i]=='A': balance += 1
             if s[i]=='C': 
                 balance -= 1
                 if balance <0:
                     if credit>0: 
                         credit -= 1
                         balance += 1
                     else: "NO"
             // '.' skip

      // If both scans pass, then "YES", and then we can output an arrangement.

  sample1: 
      forward: 
          credit=1
          i0: 'C' -> balance=-1<0 -> use credit: credit=0, balance=0.
          i1: '.' -> skip.
          i2: 'A' -> balance=1.
          i3: 'A' -> balance=2.
          i4: 'A' -> balance=3.
          i5: 'C' -> balance=2.
      backward:
          credit=1
          i5: 'C' -> balance=-1<0 -> use credit: credit=0, balance=0.
          i4: 'A' -> balance=1.
          i3: 'A' -> balance=2.
          i2: 'A' -> balance=3.
          i1: '.' -> skip.
          i0: 'C' -> balance=2.

      passes.

  sample2:
      forward: passes (credit=1 not used in forward scan for sample2? -> because sample2 in forward scan: never went to negative until the last C? 
        i0: 'A'->1
        i1: 'A'->2
        i2: 'A'->3
        i3: '.'-> skip
        i4: 'C'->2
        i5: 'C'->1
        i6: 'A'->2
        i7: 'C'->1   -> positive.
      then backward scan:
          credit=1
          i7: 'C' -> balance=-1<0 -> use credit: credit=0, balance=0.
          i6: 'A' -> balance=1.
          i5: 'C' -> balance=0.
          i4: 'C' -> balance=-1<0 -> credit=0 -> fail.

      so sample2 fails.

  sample3: "CA.A.C.A"
      total_A=4, total_C=2 -> credit=2.
      forward:
        i0: 'C' -> balance=-1<0 -> use credit=1, balance=0.
        i1: 'A' -> balance=1.
        i2: '.' -> skip.
        i3: 'A' -> balance=2.
        i4: '.' -> skip.
        i5: 'C' -> balance=1.
        i6: '.' -> skip.
        i7: 'A' -> balance=2.
      backward:
        reset credit=2.
        i7: 'A' -> balance=1.
        i6: '.' -> skip.
        i5: 'C' -> balance=0.
        i4: '.' -> skip.
        i3: 'A' -> balance=1.
        i2: '.' -> skip.
        i1: 'A' -> balance=2.
        i0: 'C' -> balance=1.
        passes.

  Therefore, the solution is:

      if total_A < total_C: 
          "NO"
      else:
          credit = total_A - total_C
          // forward scan
          balance = 0
          for i in range(2N):
             if s[i]=='A': 
                 balance += 1
             elif s[i]=='C':
                 balance -= 1
                 if balance < 0:
                     if credit > 0:
                         credit -= 1
                         balance += 1
                     else:
                         "NO"
             // else: skip
          // reset credit for backward scan
          credit = total_A - total_C
          balance = 0
          for i in range(2N-1, -1, -1):
             if s[i]=='A': 
                 balance += 1
             elif s[i]=='C':
                 balance -= 1
                 if balance < 0:
                     if credit > 0:
                         credit -= 1
                         balance += 1
                     else:
                         "NO"
          // if we get here, then "YES", and then we need to output an arrangement.

  Now, how to output the arrangement?

      We know that we need: 
          - total_C pairs to have either "AC" or "CA", and then the remaining pairs to have no C's.

      We can distribute the available A's and empty seats in the remaining pairs.

      One way:

          We will use an array of characters for the result.

          We know that we have to have exactly total_C pairs that contain one C and one A. 
          For these pairs, we can assign the C's and A's arbitrarily.

          Steps for output:

            1. In the final arrangement, we will assign the C's to distinct pairs.
            2. For each pair, if we decide to put a C in the pair, then the other seat must be an A.
            3. For the other pairs, we can only put A's and '.'.

          How to assign the positions for the C's? 
             We have to place total_C C's.

          We can do:

             not_c_count = (N - total_C) * 2   // the number of seats in the non-C pairs.
             available positions for C's: the entire 2N, but we will choose total_C pairs to be the C-pairs, and within each C-pair, we will place one C and one A.

          We can arbitrarily assign the C's to any total_C pairs.

          Within a C-pair, we can put the C in the left or the A in the left.

          Then for the non-C-pairs, we put the remaining (total_A - total_C) A's and the empty_seats = (2N - total_A - total_C) empty seats.

          Example: sample1: 
             total_C=2, so we choose 2 pairs to be C-pairs, and one pair to be non-C.
             non-C pair has 2 seats, and we have: 
                 total_A - total_C = 1, and empty_seats = 1.
             so non-C pair: one A and one empty.

          How about: 
             C-pair0: "AC"
             C-pair1: "AC"
             non-C-pair: ".A"

          -> "AC" for pair0, "AC" for pair1, ".A" for pair2 -> "ACAC.A" -> but the length is 6, sample1 has 6.

          But sample1's sample output is "CAA.AC", which is:
             pair0: "CA"
             pair1: "A." -> non-C-pair (because has no C)
             pair2: "AC"

          -> also valid.

          So any assignment is valid.

          Therefore, we can output any assignment that has exactly total_C C's, placed in distinct pairs, and in each of these pairs the other seat is an A, and the remaining seats are filled with the remaining A's and the empty seats.

          How to generate the string? 

             Let's create an array of length 2N, initially all '.'.

             Step1: Mark the pairs for C's: choose any total_C distinct pairs. For example, the first total_C pairs.

             Step2: In each of these total_C pairs, assign one C and one A. We can do alternatively: 
                     for i in range(total_C):
                         let the pair be at index = i (which means seats[2*i] and seats[2*i+1])
                         set result[2*i] = 'A'
                         result[2*i+1] = 'C'
                     // or vice versa.

             Step3: In the remaining pairs, we have to assign the remaining (total_A - total_C) A's and the empty_seats.
                     remaining_seats = 2 * (N - total_C)
                     remaining_A = total_A - total_C
                     // then we will put 'A' in the next remaining_A seats within the remaining pairs, and leave the rest as '.'.

                     for i in range(total_C, N): // pairs from total_C to N-1
                         for j in [0,1]: // within the pair
                             if remaining_A >0:
                                 result[2*i] = 'A'  // and then result[2*i+1] we will do below? 
                                 remaining_A -= 1
                             else:
                                 leave as '.'

             But note: we can distribute arbitrarily.

          However, we might have an issue: the total number of A's placed in the C-pairs is total_C (because we put one A per C-p). Then in the non-C-pairs, we put remaining_A = total_A - total_C A's.

          Example sample1: 
             total_C=2, so we take the first 2 pairs for C-pairs.
                 pair0: result[0]='A', result[1]='C'
                 pair1: result[2]='A', result[3]='C'
             then the last pair: 
                 remaining_A = 3-2=1.
                 so we put one A in the last pair: 
                     result[4]='A', result[5]='.'

          then the string is "A" (0), "C" (1), "A" (2), "C" (3), "A" (4), '.' (5) -> "ACAC.A"

          But sample output is "CAA.AC", which is different.

          Any valid arrangement is acceptable.

          sample3: 
             total_C=2, so we take the first 2 pairs for C-pairs.
                 pair0: "AC"
                 pair1: "AC"
             then the last two pairs: 
                 remaining_A = 4-2=2, and empty_seats=2.
                 so in the last two pairs (4 seats), we put two A's and two '.'.
                 for example: 
                    pair2: "A."
                    pair3: "A." -> "ACAC.A.A." -> "ACACA.A." -> wait, we have to do per pair:

                    Actually, for pair2: we have two seats: we can put one A and one '.', and for pair3: one A and one '.' -> "A." for pair2 and "A." for pair3 -> 
                         "AC" for0, "AC" for1, "A." for2, "A." for3 -> "ACACA.A." -> length8.

          but the sample output is "CA..ACA." -> 
             pair0: "CA"
             pair1: ".."
             pair2: "AC"
             pair3: "A." -> valid.

          So we can choose which pairs are the C-pairs.

          To resemble the sample output, we might not choose the first total_C pairs, but spread them out.

          However, the problem does not require a specific arrangement.

          Therefore, we output any.

          We can output: 
            for the first total_C pairs: assign "AC" in each.
            then for the next (N - total_C) pairs: assign the remaining_A A's in the first min(remaining_A, 2*(N-total_C)) positions within these pairs, and '.' for the rest.

          But within a pair, we are not restricted to put the A first.

          To avoid "C." or ".C" in the non-C-pairs, we will only put A's and '.' in the non-C-pairs.

          This is ensured because we only have A's and '.' to put in non-C-pairs.

  Therefore, the solution is:

      if total_A < total_C: 
          output "NO"
      else:
          // Do the two scans (forward and backward) as described with credit = total_A - total_C (reset in between).
          if either scan fails: "NO"
          else: 
             output "YES"
             output an arrangement:
                 result = ['.'] * (2*N)
                 // choose the first total_C pairs to be the C-p pairs.
                 for i in range(total_C):
                     result[2*i] = 'A'
                     result[2*i+1] = 'C'

                 // Then, in the remaining pairs (from pair index = total_C to N-1), we have 2*(N-total_C) = M.
                 // Let rem_A = total_A - total_C   // the number of A's to place in the non-C-p pairs.
                 // We will place 'A' in the first rem_A positions of the remaining pairs, and '.' in the rest.
                 start_index = 2 * total_C
                 for i in range(start_index, start_index + 2*(N-total_C)):
                     if i - start_index < rem_A:
                         result[i] = 'A'
                     else:
                         result[i] = '.'   // but note: we might have exactly rem_A A's, and the rest are empty.

                 // However, note: the count of '.' in the result should be 2N - total_A - total_C.
                 // Let's count: 
                 //   In the first total_C pairs: we have placed total_C 'A's and total_C 'C's -> uses 2*total_C seats.
                 //   In the non-C pairs: we placed rem_A = total_A - total_C 'A's, and the rest = 2*(N-total_C) - rem_A = 2N - 2*total_C - (total_A - total_C) = 2N - total_C - total_A = empty_seats.
                 // which is correct.

                 // But wait: in the non-C pairs, we might spread the A's arbitrarily, but we put them contiguously. That is acceptable.

                 // However, the per-pair condition: in the non-C pairs, we might have a pair with two A's, or one A and one '.', or two '.'.

                 // But note: we have placed the A's without regard to pair boundaries. We might have a pair that gets two A's, which is valid.

                 // But the assignment is by consecutive pairs. In the non-C pairs, we have:
                    for i in range(total_C, N):
                         the two seats: 
                            seat0 = result[2*i] 
                            seat1 = result[2*i+1]

                 // In our assignment, the first `rem_A` positions in the contiguous block of 2*(N-total_C) are 'A'. This might not align with the pairs.

                 // For example, if rem_A=1 and we have two pairs (4 seats), then we assign the first seat in the block as 'A', and the next three as '.'.
                 // Then the first non-C pair: seats[2*total_C] and [2*total_C+1]: 
                         seat0 = 'A', seat1 = '.' -> valid.
                 // second non-C pair: '.' and '.' -> valid.

                 // If rem_A=2 and two pairs: then we assign the first two seats as 'A', then the next two as '.'.
                 // first pair: 'A','A' -> valid.
                 // second pair: '.', '.' -> valid.

                 // If rem_A=3 and two pairs: 
                    seats: 'A','A','A','.' 
                    first pair: 'A','A' -> valid.
                    second pair: 'A','.' -> valid.

                 // If rem_A=3 and two pairs (4 seats), we only have 4 seats, so we assign three 'A' and one '.'.

                 // Therefore, it is valid.

          So we output the string ''.join(result)

  Let me test sample1: 
        N=3, total_C=2, total_A=3, empty_seats=1.
        result = array of 6 '.'.
        for i in0 and1 (total_C=2):
            i=0: result[0]='A', result[1]='C'
            i=1: result[2]='A', result[3]='C'
        then start_index=4, and we have 2*(3-2)=2 seats.
        rem_A = 3-2=1.
        so the first 1 seat in the block [4,5] is 'A', the next (2-1=1) is '.'.
        so result[4]='A', result[5]='.' -> 
            result = "A" (0), "C" (1), "A" (2), "C" (3), "A" (4), '.' (5) -> "ACAC.A"

        sample output is "CAA.AC", which is different, but both are valid.

  sample input3: 
        N=4, total_C=2, total_A=4, empty_seats=2.
        first 2 pairs: 
           pair0: "AC" -> 'A','C'
           pair1: "AC" -> 'A','C'
        then block: 2*(4-2)=4 seats, rem_A=4-2=2.
        then the first 2 seats in the block are 'A', the next 2 are '.'.
        so: 
           seats: 
               0: 'A'
               1: 'C'
               2: 'A'
               3: 'C'
               4: 'A'
               5: 'A'
               6: '.'
               7: '.' -> "ACACAA.."

        But the sample output is "CA..ACA.".

        We output "ACACAA..", which is valid.

        Alternatively, we can choose to distribute the C-p pairs to specific indices, but the problem does not require.

  However, the sample output for sample input3 is "CA..ACA.", which has the first pair as "CA", then next pair as "..", then "AC", then "A.".

        In our method, we can choose which pairs are the C-p pairs. We are currently choosing the first total_C pairs.

        To spread them out, we could choose different pairs. For example, we could choose the first and the third pair for the C-p.

        How to output an arrangement that might be more balanced? 

        Since the problem does not require a specific arrangement, we can output any.

  Therefore, the final solution is:

      n = int(input().strip())
      s = input().strip()
      total_A = s.count('A')
      total_C = s.count('C')
      empty_seats = s.count('.')

      if total_A < total_C:
          print("NO")
          exit(0)

      credit = total_A - total_C

      # forward scan
      balance = 0
      for char in s:
          if char == 'A':
              balance += 1
          elif char == 'C':
              balance -= 1
              if balance < 0:
                  if credit > 0:
                      credit -= 1
                      balance += 1
                  else:
                      print("NO")
                      exit(0)
          # else: '.' -> skip

      credit = total_A - total_C
      balance = 0
      for i in range(len(s)-1, -1, -1):
          char = s[i]
          if char == 'A':
              balance += 1
          elif char == 'C':
              balance -= 1
              if balance < 0:
                  if credit > 0:
                      credit -= 1
                      balance += 1
                  else:
                      print("NO")
                      exit(0)

      # If we passed, output an arrangement.
      print("YES")
      # We'll use the arrangement: first total_C pairs are "AC", then the next non-C pairs are filled with the remaining A's and then '.'.
      res = []
      # total_C pairs of "AC"
      for i in range(total_C):
          res.append('A')
          res.append('C')
      # Now, the remaining seats: 2*n - 2*total_C = 2*(n - total_C)
      rem_A = total_A - total_C
      total_remaining_seats = 2 * (n - total_C)
      # We will put 'A' in the next rem_A seats, and '.' in the rest.
      for i in range(total_remaining_seats):
          if i < rem_A:
              res.append('A')
          else:
              res.append('.')

      # Output the string
      print(''.join(res))

  Let's hope.

  But note: the empty_seats in the final arrangement should be empty_seats = 2n - total_A - total_C.
        In the res:
           total 'A' = total_C (from the C-p pairs) + rem_A = total_C + (total_A - total_C) = total_A.
           total 'C' = total_C.
           the rest is '.' and the count is total_remaining_seats - rem_A = 2*(n - total_C) - (total_A - total_C) = 2n - 2*total_C - total_A + total_C = 2n - total_C - total_A = empty_seats.
        so counts are correct.

  And the per-pair condition in the C-p pairs: each is "AC", so valid.
  in the non-C-p pairs: we have only 'A' and '.', so no 'C' appears in these pairs, so valid.

  Therefore, it is a valid arrangement.

  We output this.

  Note: the arrangement might not be the only one, but it is valid.

  Let me run sample input3 with this method: 
        n=4, total_A=4, total_C=2, empty_seats=2.
        res for the C-p pairs (2 pairs): 
            ['A','C','A','C'] 
        then rem_A = 4-2=2, and total_remaining_seats = 2*(4-2)=4.
        then we append 'A','A','.','.' -> 
            "ACAC" + "AA.." = "ACACAA.."

        The sample expected output is "CA..ACA.", but we output "ACACAA..", which is different but valid.

  The problem allows any valid arrangement.

  Therefore, the editorial is as above.

  Summary of the solution:

      - Count total_A, total_C, and empty_seats.
      - If total_A < total_C, output "NO".
      - Do a forward scan and a backward scan on the initial string s:
           In the forward scan:
               balance = 0
               credit = total_A - total_C
               for each character in s (from left to right):
                   if 'A', then balance++.
                   if 'C', then balance--. If balance<0, then if credit>0, use one credit (credit--, balance++), else output "NO".
           In the backward scan (right to left) with credit reset to total_A - total_C, do the same.
      - If both scans pass, then output "YES", and then output an arrangement that is generated as follows:
            For i in range(total_C):
                output for a pair: "AC" (that is, two characters 'A' and 'C')
            For the remaining (n - total_C) pairs, output a string of 
                min( (total_A - total_C), 2*(n-total_C) ) 'A's, followed by '.' for the rest.

      Note: in the non-C pairs, we output the 'A's and '.' without splitting by pairs, but it is still valid because we only require that in a pair that contains a C, the other is A, and these pairs have no C.

  This meets the constraints (O(n)) and should work.
