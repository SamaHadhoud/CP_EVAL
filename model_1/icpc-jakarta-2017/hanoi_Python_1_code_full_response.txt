To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum cost to move bricks between three parks such that the governor's desired configurations are visited at least once, and all bricks end up in a single park. The bricks must be moved one at a time, with the constraint that a smaller brick can only be placed on top of a larger brick in any park.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves moving bricks between three parks under specific constraints. The key constraints are:
   - Only the topmost brick (smallest in the park) can be moved.
   - A brick moved to another park must be smaller than the topmost brick in the destination park (or the destination park must be empty).
   - The goal is to visit each of the governor's desired configurations at least once and end with all bricks in one park, minimizing the total move cost.

2. **State Representation**: Each configuration of bricks across the three parks is represented as a tuple of three frozen sets (one per park). This allows efficient hashing and state comparison.

3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: For each state of interest (initial state, governor's desired configurations, and final states where all bricks are in one park), we use Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the minimum cost to reach every other state of interest. The algorithm explores valid moves (transferring the topmost brick between parks) and updates the cost accordingly.

4. **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**: After computing the pairwise costs between all states of interest, we model the problem as a TSP where we must start at the initial state, visit each governor's desired configuration (in any order), and end at any final state. We use dynamic programming with bitmasking to efficiently explore all subsets of visited configurations and find the minimal cost path.

### Explanation
1. **Input Parsing**: The input is read and parsed into the number of bricks (N), the number of desired configurations (M), the cost matrix (R), the initial configuration, and the governor's desired configurations.
2. **State Initialization**: The initial state, desired configurations, and final states (all bricks in one park) are stored in a list of states of interest, ensuring no duplicates.
3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: For each state of interest, Dijkstra's algorithm computes the minimum cost to reach every other state. The algorithm explores valid moves (transferring the topmost brick between parks) and updates the cost matrix.
4. **TSP with DP**: Using dynamic programming and bitmasking, the solution finds the minimal cost path that starts at the initial state, visits all desired configurations (in any order), and ends at any final state. The DP table tracks the minimal cost for each subset of visited configurations and the current state.
5. **Result Calculation**: After processing all subsets, the minimal total cost is determined by considering transitions from any state (after visiting all configurations) to any final state.

This approach efficiently handles the constraints by leveraging Dijkstra's algorithm for state transitions and dynamic programming for path optimization, ensuring minimal cost while meeting all problem requirements.
