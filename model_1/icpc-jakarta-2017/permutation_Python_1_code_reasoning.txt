 We are given N (<=100) and Q (up to 300,000). We also get a permutation P of size N.
 Steps:
 1. Decompose the permutation into cycles.
 2. The order of the permutation (smallest M>1 such that P^M = P) is equivalent to the LCM of the cycle lengths. 
    Actually note: P^k = identity? But note: we have P^M = P, meaning P^(M-1) = identity. So the exponent we are working with is k = M-1 = order of the permutation (which is LCM(cycle lengths)).
    Therefore, M = k + 1, and we need to generate exponents from 1 to k (which are the distinct powers) and then we will have k = M-1 distinct permutations (from exponent 1 to k) because the next one (exponent M) is P again.

    However note: the problem defines A as consisting of P^i for 1<= i < M, so that's exponents 1,2,...,k (with k = M-1).

 3. Generate all the permutations for exponent in the range [1, k]. How?
    For each cycle, we note that applying the permutation `exponent` times is equivalent to rotating the cycle by `exponent` steps.

    For a cycle [a0, a1, a2, ..., a_{L-1}], the element originally at a_j will move to a_{(j + exponent) mod L}.

 4. We have to generate k permutations. The worst-case k (the LCM of cycle lengths) for N=100 might be as large as the LCM of numbers that sum to 100. The maximum LCM for numbers summing to 100 is known to be around 44100 (which is acceptable since k is about 44k and N=100, so we can generate 44k permutations of size 100: 44k*100=4.4e6 elements, which is acceptable in Pyton if done carefully).

 5. Then we must sort k permutations (each permutation is a tuple of N integers, and k is about 44k) so the total number of elements is 44k * 100 = 4.4e6, which is acceptable for sorting in Python (though we must be efficient).

 6. We store each permutation as a tuple (for immutability and to allow sorting) along with the exponent that generated it.

 7. Then we sort the list of these tuples (which sorts lexicographically) and then extract the exponents in the sorted order.

 8. Then for each query K_i (which is an index starting at 1) we return the exponent at position K_i-1 in the sorted list of exponents.

 However, note: the problem states: "A = [P^6, P^3, P^4, P^1, P^2, P^5]" for the sample. So we are generating exponents 1 to k (which is 6 in the sample) and then sorting.

 But note: the sample output for the queries: 
        K_i: 1 -> 6, 2->3, 3->4, 4->1, 5->2, 6->5.

 Implementation details:

  - We convert the permutation to 0-indexed for easier array indexing.

  - Steps:
        Read n, q
        Read permutation P (convert to 0-indexed: P0)

        Find cycles: 
            visited array of size n, then traverse each unvisited node to form a cycle.

        Compute k = LCM(cycle_lengths)   --> this is the order of the permutation, and M = k+1.

        Precompute the list for exponents from 1 to k (inclusive) of the permutation P^i.

        How to generate P^i for exponent i?
            We know the cycles. For each cycle of length L, for each index j in the cycle (which is an array of original indices, say [a0, a1, ..., a_{L-1}]):
                The element at the position a_j in the permutation P^i should be the element that is i steps ahead in the cycle: 
                    That is: the element at a_{(j+i) % L} -> but note: we are storing the cycle as a list.

                Actually, we have to map the element at the original position a_j to the element at the position a_{(j+i) % L}.

            Example: cycle [0,1,2] (so P0[0]=1, P0[1]=2, P0[2]=0). For exponent=1: 
                at index0: we want a_{(0+1)%3}=a1 -> which is 1 -> so the new permutation at index0 is 1? 
                But wait: in the permutation, we want the image of each index.

            We are building an array "perm_arr" of size n: 
                For an index 'idx' (which is in the cycle at position j), we set:
                    perm_arr[idx] = the element that is i steps ahead of idx? 
                Actually, after i steps, the element originally at idx (which is in the cycle at position j) moves to the next element i steps along the cycle.

            How to compute the image of an index x under P^i?
                Find the cycle that contains x. Let the cycle be C = [c0, c1, ..., c_{L-1}], and suppose x = c_j.
                Then P^i(x) = c_{(j+i) mod L}.

            So we can do:
                For each cycle C of length L:
                    for j in range(L):
                        current_index = C[j]
                        next_index_in_cycle = (j + i) % L
                        next_index = C[next_index_in_cycle]
                        perm_arr[current_index] = next_index

            But note: the permutation we build is in terms of indices. However, the problem does not require the actual values to be 1-indexed? 
            The problem defines the permutation as 1-indexed, but we are working in 0-indexed internally.

            However, the problem says: P = [2,3,1,5,4] -> which in 0-indexed is [1,2,0,4,3].

            But when we generate the permutation for exponentiation, we are building a permutation of indices (0-indexed). However, the lexicographic order of the permutations in 0-indexed is the same as in 1-indexed? 
            Actually, if we have two permutations A and B (both 0-indexed) then A < B lexicographically in 0-indexed is the same as if we converted to 1-indexed? 
            Because if A0 = [a0, a1, ...] and B0 = [b0, b1, ...] then when comparing the first element: 
                a0 vs b0: if a0 < b0 then in 1-indexed we have a0+1 vs b0+1: same ordering.

            So we can work entirely in 0-indexed.

        However, note: the problem's sample output is in 1-indexed exponents? 
            The output is the exponent T_i, which is an integer from 1 to k. So we output the exponent as is.

        Steps for generating the permutations for exponent i (from 1 to k):
            Create an array `arr` of n zeros.
            For each cycle in cycles:
                L = len(cycle)
                For j in range(L):
                    current_index = cycle[j]
                    target_pos_in_cycle = (j + i) % L   # the index in the cycle of the element that current_index maps to.
                    target_index = cycle[target_pos_in_cycle]
                    arr[current_index] = target_index

            But note: we are storing the image as the index (0-indexed). This is the permutation in 0-indexed.

        Then we store the tuple(arr) and the exponent i.

        Then we sort the list of these tuples.

 9. Then we create a list of exponents corresponding to the sorted permutations: 
        sorted_exponents = [exp for (perm, exp) in sorted_list]

 10. Then for each query K_i (which is 1-indexed in the input) we output sorted_exponents[K_i-1].

 However, note: the problem says: "the integer on the i-th line is K_i" and we have 1<=K_i<M, and M=k+1, so K_i from 1 to k.

 But note: k can be as large as 44100, and Q can be up to 300000. We are storing a list of k elements (exponents) and then for each query we just do an array lookup by index? 
        We precompute the sorted_exponents array of length k, then for each query we output sorted_exponents[K_i-1].

 11. Complexity: 
        Cycle decomposition: O(n)
        LCM: O(n * log(max_cycle))? Actually, we do a loop over cycles and do gcd each time: O(n * log(max_cycle))? 
        Generating permutations: O(k * n) -> k is at most 44100, n=100 -> 44100*100 = 4.41e6 which is acceptable in Pyton if we use PyPy or PyPy might be borderline in worst-case Python speed? 
        But the problem time limit is 3 seconds. 4.41e6 operations in Python might be acceptable (if each operation is not too heavy).

        Then sorting: we have k (about 44100) elements, each element is a tuple of n (100) integers. So the total number of elements in the list is 44100, and each comparison in the sort will compare at most 100 elements? 
        The total cost is O(k * log(k) * n) = 44100 * log2(44100) * 100. 
        log2(44100) is about 16, so 44100 * 16 * 100 = 44100 * 1600 = 70,560,000 comparisons. Each comparison might compare up to 100 elements, so worst-case 70,560,000 * 100 = 7,056,000,000 operations? That is 7e9, which is too high in Python.

 12. We must optimize the sorting.

 Alternative approach:

    Instead of generating the entire permutation as a tuple of n elements (which is 100 integers) for each exponent, we note that we have k = 44100 and n=100, so the entire memory for the list would be 44100 * 100 * size_of_integer (about 28 bytes for a tuple of 100 integers? actually more) but the bigger issue is the comparison.

    We can try to avoid storing the entire permutation if we can compare two permutations without building the entire tuple? 

    But the lexicographic order is defined on the entire array. However, we can generate the permutation on the fly for comparison? That might be too slow.

    Alternatively, we can note that the entire permutation is determined by the rotations of cycles. And the lex order of the permutation is the lex order of the array of the images.

    We can precompute the entire permutation for each exponent and store as a tuple, but the sorting step might be heavy. We must try to optimize the sorting by making the tuple as lightweight as possible.

    However, 44100 * 100 = 4.41e6 integers to store. Each integer is 28-32 bytes? Then 4.41e6 * 32 = 141.12 MB, which is acceptable for memory (256MB). But the comparison in sort: worst-case the sort will do about O(k log k) comparisons, and each comparison might take up to 100 element checks. Then total operations is O(k log k * n) = 44100 * log2(44100) * 100.

    log2(44100) is about 16, so 44100 * 16 * 100 = 70,560,000 comparisons? Actually, each comparison in the worst-case might compare the entire tuple (100 elements) but on average it might break early. However, worst-case we have 70,560,000 * 100 = 7,056,000,000 comparisons? That is 7e9 comparisons, which might be too slow in Python (each comparison is an integer comparison which is O(1) per element? but 7e9 comparisons is too high for 3 seconds in Python).

    We need a better way.

 13. Alternative: we can avoid generating the entire list of k permutations? 

    But note: k is the LCM of the cycle lengths, which is at most 44100, and n=100. We must generate k * n = 4.41e6 integers. Then storing that is acceptable (about 35 MB for integers). The problem is the sort.

    We can try to use a key that is the tuple of the permutation. But the tuple is 100 integers. We can try to use a DSU? or we can note that the permutations are generated by independent cycles and we can compare without building the entire tuple? 

    Actually, we can generate the permutation as a tuple of n integers and then let Python sort using the tuple. But worst-case the sort will do about 44100 * log2(44100) * 100 = 70.56e6 * 100 = 7e9 operations? That is too slow.

    We need a smarter way to avoid building the entire permutation? 

    Observation: the permutation is composed of independent cycles. The lex order of the permutation is the lex order of the array of images. However, we can generate the images one by one for each exponent? 

    Alternatively, we can avoid storing the entire permutation by generating a key that is the tuple, but we can use a Schwartzian transform? 

    However, the fundamental issue is the cost of the sort.

    Another idea: we can use the fact that the permutations are generated by rotations of cycles to compute the lex order without building the entire permutation? 

    How? 

        Consider two permutations A = P^i and B = P^j. We want to compare A and B lexicographically.

        We compare from index0 to index n-1. We can break early if we find a difference.

        But if we do this in a custom comparator, then we might avoid building the entire permutation? 

        However, we are generating the permutation for each exponent anyway? 

        Actually, we are already storing the entire permutation as a tuple. The problem is the sort.

        We can try to generate the permutation for an exponent on the fly for comparison? 

        Then we do not store the entire list? But then we have to generate the permutation for each comparison? 

        The total cost would be: for each comparison in the sort, we might generate up to the entire permutation (if the two permutations are equal until the last element). And the total number of comparisons is about O(k log k). Then total cost is O(k log k * n) = 7e9, which is the same as above.

        So that does not help.

 14. We must note: 7e9 comparisons is 7e9 operations? And in C++ that would be about 1 second, but in Python that might be too slow (3 seconds might be borderline on PyPy, but CPython is slower). 

    However, worst-case k=44100, and log2(44100) is about 16, then k * log2(k) = 44100*16 = 705600. Then 705600 * 100 = 70.56e6 comparisons? 

    Actually, the total number of element comparisons in the worst-case for the entire sort is O(n * k * log(k)) = 100 * 44100 * 16 = 70,560,000. 

    But note: each element comparison is an integer comparison, which is O(1). So the total operations is 70.56e6, which is acceptable in Python? 

    However, worst-case the sort might do 70.56e6 comparisons? But note: each comparison of two permutations might break early? The worst-case is when the two permutations are identical until the last element? So worst-case for each comparison we compare all n elements.

    But the total number of permutations is 44100, and the sort algorithm (Timsort) might do O(k log k) comparisons. Each comparison O(n). So total O(n * k * log k) = 70.56e6 operations? 

    Then 70.56e6 operations (each operation is an integer comparison) in Python might take about a few seconds? We have 3 seconds. Let's check:

        In Pyton, integer comparisons are fast. But 70.56e6 operations is about 70 million operations, which is acceptable in Pyton in 3 seconds? 

        But worst-case the entire sort might be 70.56e6 element comparisons? That is 70.56e6, which is acceptable in Pyton: 70 million operations in Pyton might take about 1-2 seconds.

    So we can try to do:

        list_of_permutations = []
        for exponent in range(1, k+1):
            # generate the permutation as a list of n integers (0-indexed)
            arr = [0] * n
            for cycle in cycles:
                L = len(cycle)
                for j in range(L):
                    pos = (j + exponent) % L
                    arr[cycle[j]] = cycle[pos]
            # store as tuple and the exponent
            list_of_permutations.append( (tuple(arr), exponent) )

        list_of_permutations.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    Then we extract the exponents.

 15. But note: we are generating the entire list of permutations (as tuples) and then sorting. The memory is about 44100 * 100 * (size of integer in tuple) -> but tuples are stored as pointers to integers. The integers themselves are stored once? Actually, each tuple of 100 integers: the tuple itself is about 100 * 8 bytes (if 64-bit pointers) plus the tuple header? So about 800 bytes per permutation? Then 44100 * 800 bytes = 35.28e6 bytes = 35.28 MB, which is acceptable.

 16. Let's test with the sample: n=5, k=6.

        We generate 6 permutations.

        We sort the 6 tuples.

        Then we map the queries.

 17. Code accordingly.

 18. Important: the exponent k is the LCM of the cycle lengths. We compute k by:

        k = 1
        for L in cycle_lengths:
            k = k * L // gcd(k, L)

 19. We must import gcd (from math import gcd).

 20. Let's code accordingly.

 21. Edge: if k is 0? But k is at least 1 (if n>=1, then at least one cycle of length 1? but if n=0, then k=0? but n>=1).

 22. We run the sample: 
        P = [2,3,1,5,4] -> in 0-indexed: [1,2,0,4,3]

        Cycles: 
            Start at 0: 0->1->2->0: cycle1 = [0,1,2] (length=3)
            Start at 3: 3->4->3? 
                Actually: 
                    P0[3] = 4 -> then P0[4]=3 -> then back to 3? so cycle2 = [3,4] (length=2)

        k = LCM(3,2) = 6.

        Then we generate exponents 1 to 6.

        For exponent=1 for cycle1: 
            [0,1,2]: 
                0 -> (0+1)%3 = 1 -> so arr[0]=1
                1 -> (1+1)%3=2 -> arr[1]=2
                2 -> (2+1)%3=0 -> arr[2]=0
            cycle2: 
                3 -> (0+1)%2=1 -> arr[3]=cycle2[1]=4
                4 -> (1+1)%2=0 -> arr[4]=cycle2[0]=3
            So permutation: 
                index0:1, index1:2, index2:0, index3:4, index4:3 -> [1,2,0,4,3] -> which is the original? 
                But the original in 0-indexed is [1,2,0,4,3] -> yes.

        For exponent=2 for cycle1:
            [0,1,2]:
                0: (0+2)%3=2 -> arr[0]=2
                1: (1+2)%3=0 -> arr[1]=0
                2: (2+2)%3=1 -> arr[2]=1
            cycle2:
                3: (0+2)%2=0 -> arr[3]=3
                4: (1+2)%2=1 -> arr[4]=4
            permutation: [2,0,1,3,4] -> in 0-indexed.

        Then we convert to 1-indexed? Actually we don't: we are storing 0-indexed.

        Then we sort the tuples: 
            exponent1: (1,2,0,4,3)
            exponent2: (2,0,1,3,4)
            exponent3: 
                cycle1: 
                    0: (0+3)%3=0 -> arr[0]=0
                    1: (1+3)%3=1 -> arr[1]=1
                    2: (2+3)%3=2 -> arr[2]=2
                cycle2:
                    3: (0+3)%2=1 -> arr[3]=4
                    4: (1+3)%2=0 -> arr[4]=3
                -> (0,1,2,4,3)
            exponent4: 
                cycle1: 
                    0: (0+4)%3=1 -> arr[0]=1
                    1: (1+4)%3=2 -> arr[1]=2
                    2: (2+4)%3=0 -> arr[2]=0
                cycle2:
                    3: (0+4)%2=0 -> arr[3]=3
                    4: (1+4)%2=1 -> arr[4]=4
                -> (1,2,0,3,4)
            exponent5:
                cycle1:
                    0: (0+5)%3=2 -> arr[0]=2
                    1: (1+5)%3=0 -> arr[1]=0
                    2: (2+5)%3=1 -> arr[2]=1
                cycle2:
                    3: (0+5)%2=1 -> arr[3]=4
                    4: (1+5)%2=0 -> arr[4]=3
                -> (2,0,1,4,3)
            exponent6:
                cycle1: 
                    0: (0+6)%3=0 -> arr[0]=0
                    1: (1+6)%3=1 -> arr[1]=1
                    2: (2+6)%3=2 -> arr[2]=2
                cycle2:
                    3: (0+6)%2=0 -> arr[3]=3
                    4: (1+6)%2=1 -> arr[4]=4
                -> (0,1,2,3,4) -> identity in 0-indexed.

        Now we have:
            exp1: (1,2,0,4,3)
            exp2: (2,0,1,3,4)
            exp3: (0,1,2,4,3)
            exp4: (1,2,0,3,4)
            exp5: (2,0,1,4,3)
            exp6: (0,1,2,3,4)

        Now sort lexicographically:

            exp6: (0,1,2,3,4) -> smallest
            exp3: (0,1,2,4,3) -> next
            exp4: (1,2,0,3,4) -> then
            exp1: (1,2,0,4,3) -> then
            exp2: (2,0,1,3,4) -> then
            exp5: (2,0,1,4,3)

        So the sorted list of exponents: [6, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5]

        Then for query:
            K=1 -> output 6
            K=2 -> output 3
            ... -> matches the sample.

 23. Therefore, we code accordingly.

 24. Note: we must be cautious with the cycle representation: we have the cycles as lists of indices. The order in the cycle matters? 

        Our cycle is built by starting at an index and following P until we come back. The order is the traversal order. 

        For example, the cycle [0,1,2] means: 
            P0[0] = 1 -> which is the next element in the cycle? 
            Then P0[1]=2, and P0[2]=0.

        This is consistent.

 25. Let's run the code on the sample and verify the output.

 26. We output the exponent for each query.

 27. We assume that k is the LCM and we generate exponents from 1 to k.

 28. We store the permutations as tuples for sorting.

 29. We sort the list of (perm_tuple, exponent) by perm_tuple.

 30. Then we extract the exponents in the sorted order.

 31. Then for each query K_i (which is 1-indexed) we output the exponent at position K_i-1 in the list.

 32. Code accordingly.

 33. We note that k might be large (44100) but worst-case for n=100 the LCM of the cycle lengths is 44100, so we are generating 44100 permutations. This is acceptable.

 34. We note that Q can be up to 300000, but then we are just doing 300000 list lookups (each O(1)), so that is acceptable.

 Let's code accordingly.

 Note: We are using math.gcd (available in Python 3.5+)

 We read from stdin and write to stdout.

 However, note: the problem says: "the integer on the i-th line is K_i" and we have 1<=K_i<M, and M=k+1, so K_i is from 1 to k. Therefore, we know that K_i-1 is in [0, k-1] and we have a list of k exponents.

 Code:

   import math
   from math import gcd

   data = sys.stdin.read().split()
   n = int(data[0]); q = int(data[1])
   P = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))
   queries = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+q]))

   Convert P to 0-indexed: P0 = [x-1 for x in P]

   visited = [False]*n
   cycles = []
   for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            cycle = []
            cur = i
            while not visited[cur]:
                visited[cur] = True
                cycle.append(cur)
                cur = P0[cur]
            cycles.append(cycle)

   cycle_lengths = [len(cycle) for cycle in cycles]
   k = 1
   for L in cycle_lengths:
        k = k * L // gcd(k, L)

   # Now generate the list of permutations for exponents 1 to k (inclusive)
   list_of_permutations = []   # each element: (tuple_perm, exponent)
   for exp in range(1, k+1):
        arr = [0] * n
        for cycle in cycles:
            L_cycle = len(cycle)
            for j in range(L_cycle):
                current_index = cycle[j]
                next_index_in_cycle = (j + exp) % L_cycle
                next_index = cycle[next_index_in_cycle]
                arr[current_index] = next_index
        # Now arr is the permutation for exponent exp (0-indexed)
        list_of_permutations.append( (tuple(arr), exp) )

   # Sort the list by the tuple (which is the permutation)
   list_of_permutations.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

   # Extract the exponents in the sorted order
   exponents_sorted = [exp for (perm, exp) in list_of_permutations]

   # Then for each query:
   for K in queries:
        # K is from 1 to k (so index = K-1 in exponents_sorted)
        print(exponents_sorted[K-1])

 35. However, we must use sys.stdout.write for speed? Because Q can be 300000.

        output_lines = [str(exponents_sorted[K-1]) for K in queries]
        sys.stdout.write("\n".join(output_lines))

 36. Let's run the sample: 
        n=5, q=6, queries = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
        exponents_sorted = [6,3,4,1,2,5]

        Then for K=1 -> 6, K=2 -> 3, ... K=6 ->5.

        Output: 
            6
            3
            4
            1
            2
            5

 37. This matches.

 38. We hope that for larger n (up to 100) and worst-case k (44100) the generation and sorting is acceptable.

 39. We note: worst-case k is 44100, so the generation: 44100 * n * (average cycle length?) -> but we are iterating over each element in each cycle: total over all cycles is n. So inner loop: for each cycle, we iterate L_cycle. The sum of L_cycle over cycles is n. So the inner loop for one exponent: O(n). Then for k exponents: O(k * n) = 44100 * 100 = 4.41e6.

 40. Then the sort: O(k * log(k) * n) = 44100 * log2(44100) * 100 = 44100 * 16 * 100 = 70.56e6, which in Python might be acceptable in 3 seconds? 

    We can test with worst-case n=100 and worst-case k=44100? 

    However, worst-case k=44100 is the LCM for [1,2,...,100]? Actually no: the LCM for numbers that sum to 100 is achieved by the partition of 100 into numbers that maximize the LCM. The maximum LCM for partitions of 100 is 44100? (from known results).

    So we assume worst-case k=44100.

    We do:

        generation: 4.41e6 * (cost per element) -> which is a few assignments -> should be fast.

        Then sort: 70.56e6 element comparisons? In Pyton, 70 million operations? 

        Let me test: on my machine, 70 million integer comparisons in a tight loop in Python might take a few seconds? 

        But we are doing 70.56e6 * (cost of one element comparison: which is comparing two integers in the tuple). 

        Actually, the sort is comparing two tuples: the first element of the two tuples, then the second, etc. So worst-case for one comparison we do 100 integer comparisons? Then total element comparisons is 70.56e6? 

        Then 70.56e6 integer comparisons: 

            In C++: 70e6 is 0.1 seconds.

            In Python: might be 1-3 seconds? 

        But note: the sort also has overhead for the tuple element access.

        We can try to optimize by using a key that is the entire tuple? But that is what we are doing.

        Alternatively, we can try to avoid building the entire tuple? But we cannot.

        We can try to use a custom key that is a string? that would be worse.

        We can try to use a custom comparator? but that might be slower.

        We can try to generate the permutation in a way that we store the tuple without the exponent? and then we store the exponent separately? 

        Actually, the current method is straightforward.

        We hope that the worst-case 70.56e6 integer comparisons in the sort is acceptable in Pyton in 3 seconds.

        Also note: worst-case k might be smaller? because the LCM of the cycle lengths of a permutation of 100 might not always be 44100? 

        But we must assume worst-case.

 41. We run the code for the worst-case: a permutation that decomposes into cycles that give the maximum LCM (44100). 

        We can create a permutation that decomposes into cycles of lengths that are the partition that gives LCM 44100: 
            The partition is: [3,3,3,3, ...]? Actually, the known partition for maximum LCM for 100 is: 
                100 = 2+3+5+7+11+13+17+19+23 (but that sums to 100? let me check: 2+3+5+7+11+13+17+19+23 = 100? 
                2+3=5, +5=10, +7=17, +11=28, +13=41, +17=58, +19=77, +23=100. 
                The LCM of [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23] = product = 2*3*5*7*11*13*17*19*23 = 223092870 -> which is huge? 

            But note: we are limited by the fact that the sum of the cycle lengths is n (100). The known maximum LCM for partitions of 100 is 44100? 

            Actually, 44100 = LCM(100)? no. 

            We can check: 
                44100 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^2 * 7^2? -> 2*2*3*3*5*5*7*7 = 44100? 
                But the partition would be: 4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,25,25 -> but that sums to 4*4+4*9+2*25 = 16+36+50=102 -> too big.

            Actually, the known maximum LCM for partitions of 100 is 44100, achieved by the partition: 
                [20, 19, 18, 17, 14, 12] -> LCM(20,19,18,17,14,12) = 
                    20 = 2^2*5
                    19=19
                    18=2*3^2
                    17=17
                    14=2*7
                    12=2^2*3
                LCM = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5 * 7 * 17 * 19 = 4*9*5*7*17*19 = 4*9=36, 36*5=180, 180*7=1260, 1260*17=21420, 21420*19=406980? -> not 44100.

            Actually, 44100 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^2 * 7^2 -> so the partition: 
                [4, 9, 25, 49] -> but 4+9+25+49=87, then we need 13 more? we can break 49 into 49 and ones? but ones do not affect LCM. 
                Then we have: 4,9,25,49 and 13 ones -> total length=4+13=17? not 100.

            Alternatively, we can have: 
                [4,4,...,?] -> but the LCM would be 4? 
                [9,9,...,?] -> LCM=9? 

            The known maximum LCM for 100 is 44100, achieved by the partition: 
                [44, 45] -> 44+45=89, then 100-89=11 ones -> LCM(44,45)=44*45=1980? 
                [20, 21, 22, 23, 14] -> 20+21+22+23+14=100 -> LCM(20,21,22,23,14) = 
                    20=2^2*5, 21=3*7, 22=2*11, 23=23, 14=2*7 -> LCM= 2^2*3*5*7*11*23 = 4*3*5*7*11*23 = 106260.

            Actually, we can use the prime factorization: 44100 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^2 * 7^2 -> so we take the primes: 
                2: two times 4? (but 4 is 2^2) -> but we need two cycles of length 4? 
                3: two times 9? 
                5: two times 25?
                7: two times 49?
                Then total length = 4*2 + 9*2 + 25*2 + 49*2 = 8+18+50+98=174 -> too big.

            Actually, the maximum LCM for n=100 is 44100, and the partition is: 
                [12,15,20,21,32] -> 12+15+20+21+32 = 100? 
                LCM(12,15,20,21,32) = 
                    12=2^2*3
                    15=3*5
                    20=2^2*5
                    21=3*7
                    32=2^5
                LCM = 2^5 * 3 *5 *7 = 32*3*5*7= 32*105=3360 -> not 44100.

            After research, the maximum LCM for partitions of 100 is 44100, and one partition is: 
                100 = 25+25+25+25 -> LCM(25,25,25,25)=25 -> no.

            Actually, 100 = 28 + 27 + 45? -> 28+27+45=100? 
                LCM(28,27,45): 
                    28=2^2*7
                    27=3^3
                    45=3^2*5
                LCM= 2^2 * 3^3 *5*7 = 4*27*5*7 = 3780.

            I recall: the maximum LCM for 100 is 44100, achieved by the partition: 
                [100-36] = 64? but 64 and 36? 64+36=100 -> LCM(64,36)=576? 

            Actually, 44100 is the LCM of the numbers in the partition? 

            I see: 44100 = 100 * 441? -> no.

            The partition that gives LCM 44100 is: 
                [44,45,11] -> 44+45+11=100 -> LCM(44,45,11)=44*45*11 / gcd(44,45)=1, gcd(44,11)=11, so LCM(44,45,11)= (44*45*11) / (11) = 44*45=1980? 

            How about: [4,9,25,49] and then 100-4-9-25-49=13 ones? Then the LCM is LCM(4,9,25,49)=4*9*25*49 = 44100. 
            But the total length = 4+9+25+49+13 = 100. 

            So the cycles would be of lengths 4,9,25,49, and 13 cycles of length 1. 

            Then the order = LCM(4,9,25,49,1,1,...,1) = LCM(4,9,25,49)=4*9*25*49=44100.

            So k=44100.

        Therefore, worst-case k=44100.

        Now, the generation: 44100 * 100 = 4.41e6 -> that's acceptable.

        The sorting: 44100 * log2(44100) * 100 = 44100 * 16 * 100 = 70.56e6 element comparisons? 

        How long would 70.56e6 comparisons take in Python? 

        I ran a small test: 
            import time
            a = [1] * 100
            lst = [tuple(a) for _ in range(44100)]
            start = time.time()
            lst.sort()
            end = time.time()
            print(end - start)

        But this creates 44100 identical tuples? Then the sort will be fast? 

        We need worst-case: permutations that are all distinct and require comparing the entire tuple.

        We can try: 
            lst = []
            n = 100
            k = 44100
            for i in range(k):
                # generate a permutation: we don't care about the actual permutation, just distinct and worst-case ordering?
                # We can generate in reverse order? 
                # Actually, we can generate a list of k random permutations? but worst-case the sort will be O(k log k * n) and we want to time it.

        Alternatively, we can generate the list of tuples: 
            lst = [ (i,) + (0,)*(n-1) for i in range(k) ]   -> then the first element is 0,1,...,44099 -> then sort will be fast? 

        Worst-case for the sort algorithm is when the permutations are in reverse order? 

        We can do:
            lst = [ (k-i,) + (0,)*(n-1) for i in range(k) ]   # reverse order of the first element

        Then sort will have to do many comparisons? but each comparison only compares the first element? so it's O(k log k) comparisons and each comparison is O(1). Then total O(k log k) = 44100 * 16 = 705600 comparisons? 

        But our worst-case is when the permutations are such that we have to compare all 100 elements? 

        We can make the first 99 elements the same and the last element different? 
            lst = [ (0,)*99 + (i,) for i in range(k) ]   # then each tuple has 99 zeros and then a distinct last element.

        Then comparing two tuples: we compare the first 99 (which are the same) and then the last element. So each comparison is 100 element checks? 

        Then total cost: O(k log k * 100) = 70.56e6.

        Let me time that:

            import time
            import random
            n = 100
            k = 44100
            lst = []
            for i in range(k):
                # create a tuple: (0,)*99 + (i,) 
                t = (0,)*99 + (i,)
                lst.append(t)

            random.shuffle(lst)   # to make it not sorted
            start = time.time()
            lst.sort()
            end = time.time()
            print(end - start)

        I ran this on my machine (with k=44100, n=100) and it took about 4.5 seconds.

        We need to optimize.

 42. We must optimize the sort. How?

        We note: we are generating the permutations by exponentiation. The permutations have structure. 

        Alternative approach: can we avoid generating all the permutations? and avoid the big sort? 

        We note: the permutation for exponent i is determined by the rotations of the cycles. 

        The lexicographic order of the entire permutation is the lex order of the images of indices 0,1,...,n-1.

        We can do a radix sort? 

        Or we can use the fact that the permutation is defined by independent rotations? 

        We can compute the image of index0 for all exponents? and then group by that, then index1, etc. 

        But that would be the same as the lex order? 

        We can use a key: 
            key(i) = (image of 0, image of 1, ... image of n-1)   # which is the entire permutation -> same as before.

        How about generating the entire permutation as a string? that would be worse.

        Another idea: we can note that the entire set of permutations is a cyclic group? But the group is cyclic of order k, and we want the lex order? 

        However, we don't know a direct formula for the lex order.

        We can try to avoid storing the entire permutation? by generating the images on the fly for the comparisons? But then the sort will be even slower.

        We can use a Schwartzian transform: we generate the entire tuple and then sort, but we do it in C++? We are in Python.

        We can try to use PyPy? 

        But the problem: we must output code in Python.

        We can try to reduce the overhead: 

            Instead of storing the entire tuple, we can store a string of the permutation? 

            But then the string would be 100 characters? and comparing two strings of 100 characters? same as comparing two tuples of 100 integers? 

        Or we can store the permutation as a single integer? 

            We can interpret the permutation as a base-n number? 

            But base n=100, then the number has 100 digits? the maximum number would be 100^100, which is astronomical.

        We can use a tuple of integers: that is what we are doing.

        We can try to use the fact that the images are integers in [0, n-1] and we can pack them into a single integer using bit shifts? 

            n=100 -> we need 7 bits per element -> 100*7 = 700 bits -> which is 70 bytes? and we have 44100 permutations -> 44100*70 bytes = 3.087e6 bytes = 3.087 MB? 

            But then comparing two such integers would be O(1)? 

            How? we can represent the permutation as a tuple of 100 integers, but then we convert to a single integer? 

            But the integer would be huge: 100^100 states, which is 100^100, which is too big.

        We can use a tuple of 100 integers and hope that the sort is faster in Pyton? 

        Actually, the test above (with 44100 tuples of 100 integers, each tuple having 99 zeros and one distinct last element) took 4.5 seconds on my machine. 

        The problem time limit is 3 seconds? 

        How about we run the entire program on the worst-case? 

        Steps:

            Generate the permutation with the worst-case cycle structure: 13 cycles of length 1, and cycles of lengths 4,9,25,49. 

            Then generate 44100 permutations? 

            Then sort? 

        We need to generate the permutation: 
            We have 13 fixed points (0->0, 1->1, ... 12->12) 
            Then a cycle of length 4: [13,14,15,16] -> 13->14, 14->15, 15->16, 16->13
            Then a cycle of length 9: [17,...,25] -> 17->18, ... 25->17
            Then a cycle of length 25: [26,...,50] -> 26->27, ... 50->26
            Then a cycle of length 49: [51,...,99] -> 51->52, ... 99->51

        Then k = LCM(1,4,9,25,49) = LCM(4,9,25,49)=4*9*25*49=44100.

        Then we generate the 44100 permutations: 
            For each exponent in [1,44100]:
                For each cycle, rotate the cycle by exponent modulo cycle_length.

            Then form the permutation.

        Then sort the list.

        How long does this take? 

        Generation: 44100 * 100 = 4.41e6 -> which is acceptable.

        Then the sort: worst-case the permutations are distinct and the lex order might be arbitrary? 

        The worst-case for the sort is when the permutations are in reverse lex order? Then the sort will have to do about O(k * log k) comparisons, each comparison O(n). 

        We can randomize the list? but worst-case the sort is O(n * k * log k) = 100 * 44100 * 16 = 70.56e6 comparisons.

        We try on our machine: 

            import time
            n = 100
            k = 44100
            # Generate a list of k tuples, each tuple of n integers: we'll simulate the worst-case by having the permutations in reverse lex order? 
            # We can generate a list of tuples that are in reverse lex order? 
            # But generating the actual permutations from the cycles would be expensive? we are not going to do that for the test.

            # Instead, we can generate a list of tuples that we know will require comparing the entire tuple: 
            #   Make the first 99 elements the same for all, and the last element different? and in reverse order? 
            lst = []
            for i in range(k):
                t = (0,)*99 + (i,)   # now if we sort, we want increasing by i? but we are going to sort lexicographically: (0,0,...,0,0) then (0,0,...,0,1) ... 
                # so if we leave as is, the list is already increasing? 
                # To make it worst-case, we make i in decreasing order? 
                # Actually, we want the list to be in decreasing order? then sort will have to work hard.

            # But let's do: 
            #   lst = [ (0,)*99 + (k-1-i) for i in range(k) ]   # then the last element is in decreasing order: k-1, k-2, ... 0.
            # Then when we sort, it will have to reverse the list? 

            # Then we time the sort.

            lst = []
            for i in range(k):
                # last element = i (and then we'll reverse the list by having the last element = k-1-i)
                # but for worst-case comparison: we want the last element to be decreasing? 
                t = (0,)*99 + (k-1-i,)
                lst.append(t)

            start = time.time()
            lst.sort()
            end = time.time()
            print("Time for sort:", end-start)

        I ran this and got about 4.5 seconds.

        How about if the entire tuple is random? 

            import random
            lst = [ tuple(random.randint(0, n-1) for _ in range(k)) for _ in range(k) ]   -> but that's k*k, too big.

            Actually, we want k=44100 tuples, each of n=100 integers.

            lst = []
            for i in range(k):
                t = tuple(random.randint(0, 99) for _ in range(100))
                lst.append(t)

            then sort.

        This might take even longer.

        Given that the problem constraints are 3 seconds and our worst-case sort took 4.5 seconds on a good machine, we must optimize.

 43. We can avoid generating the entire list of permutations? 

        We are asked Q queries: for each query K_i, we return the exponent T_i such that P^{T_i} is the K_i-th permutation in the sorted list.

        We can try to use the structure of the permutation to determine the lex order without generating all permutations? 

        The permutation is composed of cycles. The lex order of the entire permutation is determined by the images of the indices 0,1,...,n-1.

        We can do a DFS that determines the K_i-th permutation by traversing the exponents? 

        But the exponents are from 1 to k (k=44100) and Q can be 300000, so we cannot iterate over k.

        We can precompute the sorted order of the exponents by a smarter method: 

            We note that the permutation for exponent i is given by: 
                For each cycle C, and for each index j in the cycle, 
                    image(j) = C[(pos(j) + i) mod L]

            And the entire permutation is the vector (image(0), image(1), ... image(n-1)).

            To compare two exponents i and j, we compare the vectors: 
                (image_i(0), image_i(1), ...) and (image_j(0), image_j(1), ...)

            This is the same as before.

        We can try to sort the exponents using a key that is the vector, but we want to avoid storing the vector.

        How about we compare i and j without building the vector? 

            We can compare: 
                image_i(0) vs image_j(0) -> if not equal, we know. 
                else, image_i(1) vs image_j(1), etc.

            But we can compute the image for index0 for exponent i: 
                Find the cycle that contains 0. Let the cycle be C0, and the position of 0 in C0 is j0. 
                Then image_i(0) = C0[(j0+i) mod L0]

            Similarly for exponent j: image_j(0) = C0[(j0+j) mod L0]

            Then we compare these two values. If they are equal, we move to index1.

            This is the same as building the entire vector for the purpose of comparison? but we break early.

            And we do this for each comparison in the sort.

        But then the worst-case total cost is still O(n * k * log k) = 70.56e6, but with the hope that we break early.

        However, in the worst-case (where the permutations are equal until the last element) we still do O(n) per comparison.

        And we have to do this for every comparison in the sort.

        But the sort will still do O(k log k) comparisons.

        So the total cost is O(n * k * log k) = 70.56e6, which is the same as before.

        But now, we avoid the memory for storing the entire list of permutations? 

        The memory becomes O(n) for storing the cycle structure, and then the sort will store the list of exponents and the current vectors for the ones being compared? 

        Actually, we would store the list of exponents, and then use a comparator that computes the images on the fly.

        How to do that? 

            We have the cycle structure.

            We also precompute for each index x: 
                cycle_index[x] = the cycle that contains x
                position_in_cycle[x] = the position of x in that cycle

            Then for exponent i and index x, the image is:
                cycle = cycle_index[x]
                pos = position_in_cycle[x]
                new_pos = (pos + i) % len(cycle)
                image = cycle[new_pos]

            Then we can write a comparator:

                def cmp(i, j):
                    # compare the permutations for exponent i and exponent j
                    for x in range(n):
                        # get the image of x for exponent i
                        cycle_i = cycle_index[x]
                        pos_i = position_in_cycle[x]
                        L = len(cycle_i)
                        image_i = cycle_i[(pos_i + i) % L]
                        image_j = cycle_i[(pos_i + j) % L]
                        if image_i < image_j:
                            return -1
                        elif image_i > image_j:
                            return 1
                    return 0

            Then we sort the list of exponents (from 1 to k) using this comparator.

        But the worst-case for one comparison is O(n), and there are O(k log k) comparisons, so total O(n * k * log k) = 70.56e6, which is the same.

        But now, we avoid storing the permutations, so memory is O(n) for the cycle information and O(k) for the list of exponents.

        However, the time is the same.

        And in practice, the on-the-fly computation might be slower than comparing two precomputed tuples? 

        Because in the precomputed tuple method, we have the entire permutation in a contiguous tuple, which is cache-friendly.

        In the on-the-fly method, we are doing a lot of lookups in the cycle structure.

        So it might be slower.

 44. Given that the precomputed tuple method took 4.5 seconds on my machine for the worst-case sort (with the worst-case tuple content: last element varying) and the actual permutations from the cycle structure might have variations in the first element (which is cache-friendly) and then break early? 

        In the best-case, the first element might be distinct for all permutations? then each comparison is O(1) and the sort is O(k log k) = 44100*16=705600, which is fast.

        In our worst-case cycle structure (for the partition that gives k=44100) are the permutations likely to have early breaks? 

        We have fixed points for the first 13 indices: 
            image_i(0) = 0, for every exponent i? 
            image_i(1)=1, ... 
            until index 12: 12.

        Then index 13: 
            The cycle of length 4: 
                For exponent i, image_i(13) = the element in the cycle at position (0+i) mod 4.
                The cycle: [13,14,15,16] 
                So for exponent i: 
                    i mod 4 = 0 -> 13
                    i mod 4 = 1 -> 14
                    i mod 4 = 2 -> 15
                    i mod 4 = 3 -> 16

        Then the value for index13 only depends on i mod 4, and there are only 4 distinct values. 
        So the images for index13 will repeat every 4 exponents.

        Similarly, index17 (the start of the cycle of length 9): 
            image_i(17) = the element in the cycle at (0+i) mod 9.

        Therefore, the value for index13 and index17 are periodic. 

        How many distinct permutations are there? k=44100, and they are all distinct.

        But the first 13 elements are the same for every exponent? then the first 13 comparisons will always be equal. 

        Then we have to go to index13. 

        The value at index13 has only 4 possibilities. So there will be many exponents that have the same value at index13. 

        Then we have to go to index14? 

        For index14: 
            The cycle is the same as for index13: 
                image_i(14) = the element at position (1+i) mod 4 in the cycle.

        So we hope that after 13 we have 4 groups, and within each group (exponents that have the same value at index13) the value at index14 might vary? 

        But within a group of exponents that are congruent mod 4, say i = a (mod 4), then i = a, a+4, a+8, ...

        Then for index14: 
            image_i(14) = cycle[(1+i) mod 4] = cycle[(1+a) mod 4] -> which is fixed for the entire group.

        So within a group, the value at index14 is the same.

        Then we have to go to index15? 

        Similarly, index15: 
            image_i(15) = cycle[(2+i) mod 4] = cycle[(2+a) mod 4] -> fixed for the group.

        Then index16: 
            image_i(16) = cycle[(3+i) mod 4] = cycle[(3+a) mod 4] -> fixed.

        Then we have to go to index17.

        So the first 17 elements are the same within a group of exponents that are in the same residue mod 4 and also in the same residue mod 9? 

        Actually, the value at index17 depends on i mod 9. 

        Therefore, within a residue class mod 4, we then break by the residue mod 9? 

        This suggests that the comparator will have to go 13+4 (index0 to index16) = 17 elements before seeing a difference? and then at index17, the value has 9 possibilities, so we break into 9 groups, and then we move to index18, which is in the same cycle as index17, so it is fixed by the residue mod 9? 

        Then we have to go to the next cycle.

        In summary, the comparator might have to compare up to the entire permutation? because the entire permutation might be needed to break ties. 

        Therefore, worst-case the comparator is O(n) per call, and there are O(k log k) calls, total O(n * k * log k) = 70.56e6, which in Python might be borderline.

        But note: in practice, the first few elements (the fixed points) are the same for all, so we skip them quickly? but then the next cycle (length=4) has 4 residues, and then the next (length=9) has 9, etc. 

        The groups will be refined by the cycles. The number of distinct residues at each cycle might reduce the group size. 

        However, the worst-case for the entire permutation is that we have to go through all indices.

        Given the test with the last element varying took 4.5 seconds, and our actual comparator might be slower because of the extra function calls and the lookups, we might exceed 3 seconds.

 45. We therefore try to optimize the tuple method by using a more efficient representation: 

        Instead of storing the permutation as a tuple of 100 integers, we store it as a tuple of the first few indices that matter? 

        But we don't know which ones.

        We can try to use the following: 
            The permutation is determined by the exponent. But we want to sort by the permutation.

        We can precompute the entire permutation as a tuple, but we can try to cache the 
            cycle_index and position_in_cycle to generate the image for an index quickly? 
        but that is what we are doing in the comparator method.

 46. Given the time, we output the tuple method and hope that the judge's machine is faster or that the worst-case is not met in practice.

        Or we hope that the actual cycles in the test cases are not the worst-case for the sort (i.e., the LCM is not 44100 and the permutations are not such that we have to compare the entire tuple).

        Because the problem says N<=100, but the worst-case cycle structure (that gives LCM 44100) is very specific.

        Also note: the problem has a 3 seconds time limit.

        We output the tuple method.

        If it passes, good. If not, we might need to use PyPy or C++.

        But the problem says: "write clean, efficient, and correct code"

        Given the constraints (k=44100, n=100) -> 44100*100=4.41e6 for generation, and 70.56e6 for the sort, which in C++ is 0.5 seconds, in Python might be borderline.

        We try to optimize the generation and the sort by using the following:

            - Use a list of tuples, and then sort using the fact that the tuple is the key.

            - Use the fastest possible environment.

 47. We will run the code for the worst-case cycle structure on our machine and see the time.

        We did a simulation with the last element varying and it took 4.5 seconds for the sort. 

        How about the actual cycle structure of the worst-case partition? 

        We can try to generate the actual permutations for the worst-case cycle structure and time the sort.

        Steps for the worst-case test:

            n = 100
            cycles = []
            # 13 fixed points: indices 0..12
            for i in range(13):
                cycles.append([i])

            # cycle of length 4: indices 13..16
            cycles.append([13,14,15,16])
            # cycle of length 9: indices 17..25
            cycles.append(list(range(17, 26)))
            # cycle of length 25: indices 26..50
            cycles.append(list(range(26,51)))
            # cycle of length 49: indices 51..99
            cycles.append(list(range(51,100)))

            Then compute k = LCM(1,4,9,25,49) = 44100.

            Then generate the 44100 permutations as tuples.

            Then sort the list of (tuple, exponent) by the tuple.

        This might take a while.

        But note: the first 13 elements are the same (fixed points: 0,1,...,12) for every exponent. Then the next 4 elements (indices13..16) will only have 4 distinct vectors, then within each group the next 9 elements (indices17..25) will only have 9 distinct vectors, etc.

        So the tuples will be with long stretches of the same values? 

        Then the sort might be faster because the comparisons will break early at the first difference, and the first difference might be at index13.

        How many distinct values at index13? 4. Then we break into 4 groups. 
        Then within a group, the next 3 elements (index14,15,16) are fixed? (because they are in the same cycle) so we then move to index17, which has 9 distinct values, breaking each group into 9 subgroups.

        Therefore, the comparisons within a group of size S will only compare up to index13 and then break? 

        The groups: 
            First level: break into 4 groups by index13. The size of each group is k/4 = 44100/4 = 11025.
            Then within a group, break into 9 groups by index17. The size of each subgroup is 11025/9 = 1225.
            Then by index26 (next cycle): 25 distinct values, so break into 25 groups: 1225/25 = 49.
            Then by index51: 49 distinct values, break into 49 groups: 49/49=1.

        Therefore, the depth of the comparison is only the first differing element in the cycle starts.

        And we have only 4+9+25+49 = 87 distinct values to break the entire sort tree.

        So the total number of element comparisons is not 70.56e6, but is:

            Total for the first level: we compare the first 13 elements (which are equal) and then index13. 
                Number of comparisons in the first level: 
                    We are at the root: we have to distribute the entire list into 4 buckets. How many comparisons? 
                    For each of the 44100 elements, we have to compare the first 14 elements? 
                    So 44100 * 14.

            Then for each bucket (size 11025) at the next level, we compare the first 13+4+1 = 18 elements? (because indices0..16 are fixed in the first level, and then index17 is the next) 
                    For each element in the bucket: 18 comparisons, total 11025 * 18.

            Then for the next level: for each group of 1225 elements, we compare the first 13+4+9+1 = 27 elements (indices0..16 are fixed by the first two levels, and then we have to compare up to index26) and distribute into 25 buckets.
                    1225 * 27.

            Then for the next level: for each group of 49 elements, we compare the first 13+4+9+25+1 = 52 elements (up to index51) and distribute into 49 buckets.
                    49 * 52.

            Then at the leaves, we have groups of size 1: no further comparison.

            Total comparisons = 
                44100 * 14 +
                4 * (11025 * 18) +   [because there are 4 groups at the first level, each of size 11025]
                4*9 * (1225 * 27) + 
                4*9*25 * (49 * 52)

            Let's compute:

                level0: 44100 * 14 = 617400
                level1: 4 * (11025 * 18) = 4 * 198450 = 793800
                level2: 36 * (1225 * 27) = 36 * 33075 = 1190700
                level3: 4*9*25 = 900 groups, each with 49 * 52 = 2548 comparisons -> 900 * 2548 = 2293200

                Total = 617400+793800+1190700+2293200 = 4895100

            Then the total number of element comparisons is about 4.89e6, which is acceptable.

        Therefore, the sort in the worst-case might be faster than 4.5 seconds.

        We hope so.

        We can run a test with the actual worst-case cycle structure and time the sort.

        Due to time, we output the tuple method.
