To solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a safe path between two fire lookout towers located at opposite corners of a rectangular area, avoiding any burning hotspots. The safe path must lie within the rectangle and not enter any hotspot's interior. 

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves checking connectivity between two points in a rectangle while avoiding circular hotspots. The solution leverages graph theory to model potential barriers formed by the hotspots. The key insight is that if there is a connected chain of hotspots linking opposite boundaries (left-right or bottom-top), the towers cannot communicate.
2. **Graph Construction**:
   - **Nodes**: Each relevant hotspot (that intersects the rectangle) and four boundary nodes (left, right, bottom, top).
   - **Edges**: 
     - Between two hotspots if their circles overlap.
     - Between a hotspot and a boundary if the hotspot touches that boundary.
3. **Connectivity Check**: Using BFS, we check if there's a path between:
   - Left and right boundaries (indicating a vertical barrier).
   - Bottom and top boundaries (indicating a horizontal barrier).
   If either path exists, the towers cannot communicate; otherwise, they can.

### Explanation
1. **Input Parsing**: The input consists of the coordinates of the two towers defining the rectangle and the number of hotspots. Each hotspot is defined by its center coordinates and radius.
2. **Filtering Relevant Hotspots**: Only hotspots that intersect the rectangle are considered. This is checked by verifying if the nearest point in the rectangle to the hotspot's center lies within the hotspot's radius.
3. **Graph Construction**:
   - **Boundary Nodes**: Four nodes represent the rectangle's boundaries (left, right, bottom, top).
   - **Hotspot-Boundary Edges**: An edge is added between a hotspot and a boundary if the hotspot touches the boundary.
   - **Hotspot-Hotspot Edges**: An edge is added between two hotspots if their circular regions overlap.
4. **Connectivity Check**: Using BFS, we check for paths between:
   - Left and right boundaries (vertical barrier).
   - Bottom and top boundaries (horizontal barrier).
   If either path exists, the towers cannot communicate ("NO"); otherwise, they can ("YES"). 

This approach efficiently checks for barriers formed by hotspots, ensuring optimal performance even with the constraint of up to 1000 hotspots. The BFS ensures linear time complexity relative to the number of nodes and edges.
