We are given a tree with N nodes (warehouses) and N-1 edges (special rails). There are Q queries. In each query, we are given a set S of K robot locations (K <= 50). We need to choose an assembly point (any node in the tree) such that the total distance traveled by all robots (which is the sum of the distances from each robot location to the assembly point) is minimized. Note that the total distance is exactly the number of special rail usages (each edge in the path is used once per robot that traverses it).

However, note: the problem asks for the minimum total rail usage, which is the same as the minimum sum of distances from the robots to the assembly point. This is the definition of the "tree median" problem (or the 1-median problem on trees). But note: in trees, the median minimizes the sum of distances. However, there is a known efficient approach for such queries when the set of robots is small (K up to 50) and the tree is large (up to 100,000 nodes).

But note: the problem does not require us to output the assembly point, only the minimum total rail usage (i.e., the minimum sum of distances).

How to compute the sum of distances for a set of nodes to a chosen point? We can precompute:

1. Precompute the depth of each node and the parent pointers for binary lifting (to compute LCA quickly).
2. Precompute a way to quickly compute the distance between two nodes: 
   dist(u, v) = depth[u] + depth[v] - 2 * depth[LCA(u, v)]

But note: we have Q up to 5000 and each query has up to 50 robots. If we try every candidate assembly point, what are the candidates? Note that the assembly point must be a node in the tree. However, we cannot iterate over all N nodes per query (5000*100000 is too big).

Alternatively, we know that the median in a tree has the property that it lies on the minimal path connecting the set of robots. Specifically, the optimal assembly point is a vertex that lies on the minimal path (which is the Steiner tree of the set S) and that minimizes the sum of distances. In fact, the problem reduces to: for a set S, we can compute the sum of distances from each node in S to a central point on the tree.

We can use the following approach:

Step 1: Preprocessing the tree
- Root the tree arbitrarily (say at node 1).
- Precompute depth for each node (using BFS/DFS).
- Precompute parent table for binary lifting (to compute LCA in O(logN)).

Step 2: For each query
  Given a set S of K nodes (K<=50).

  We can do:
  a) Find the minimal subtree that contains all nodes in S. This subtree is the union of all simple paths between nodes in S. Since the set is small, we can use the following:

  b) We know that the minimal subtree is the Steiner tree of S. We can compute the convex hull (in tree terms) of S: that is, the minimal connected subtree that contains S. This is the union of the simple paths between every pair of nodes in S? Actually, it is the smallest subtree that contains all the nodes in S and it is known to be the union of the simple paths between the two nodes that are the diameter of the set S? Actually, we can use the following trick:

      i) Find two nodes u and v in S that are maximally apart (the diameter of the set S). How? We can do: 
          - Start from an arbitrary node in S, find the farthest node in S (say u).
          - Then from u, find the farthest node in S (say v). Then the path from u to v is the diameter of S.

      ii) Then the minimal subtree is the union of the simple paths from every node in S to the path between u and v? Actually, the entire Steiner tree is the union of the simple paths between u and v and the branches to the other nodes? But note: the Steiner tree for a set S in a tree is the minimal connected subgraph that contains S, which is the union of the simple paths between all pairs? Actually, we know that in trees the Steiner tree is the union of the simple paths between every pair of nodes in S? That would be too big. Alternatively, we can note that the Steiner tree is the smallest subtree that contains S, and it is the union of the simple paths between the nodes of S? Actually, it is the entire induced subtree on the set of nodes that lie on the simple paths between every pair of nodes in S. But we can compute the minimal subtree by taking the set of all nodes that are in the union of the paths from each node to the diameter endpoints? Actually, we don't need the entire Steiner tree explicitly.

  c) However, note: the optimal assembly point (minimizing the sum of distances) must lie on the Steiner tree? Actually, yes, because if we move the assembly point one step away from the Steiner tree, then we are increasing the distance to every node in S by at least 1 (and decreasing to none). Therefore, the optimal point lies on the Steiner tree.

  But note: the Steiner tree for S in a tree is the minimal connected subtree that contains S. The set of candidate assembly points is the entire Steiner tree? Actually, we can consider only the nodes in the Steiner tree. However, the Steiner tree for S in a tree is the smallest subtree that contains S. How to get the Steiner tree? We can do:

      - Let T be the set of nodes: initially, we mark all nodes in S.
      - Then we can mark all the LCA's that are needed? Actually, we can use the following: the Steiner tree is the union of the simple paths between every pair of nodes in S? That would be too expensive (O(K^2)).

  Alternatively, we can use the following: the Steiner tree for S in a tree is the union of the simple paths between the two diameter endpoints (u and v) and the branches to the other nodes? Actually, we can build the Steiner tree by:

      - Sort the nodes in S by their DFS order (or Euler Tour order) and then take the union of the paths from the first to the last? Actually, we can use the following: the minimal subtree that contains S is the union of the simple paths between all consecutive nodes in the sorted DFS order? But that is not exactly: we need to take the union of the paths between the first and last in the DFS order and then the ones that branch off? Actually, we can use the following algorithm:

          SteinerTree(S):
            Let T be the set of nodes: start with S.
            Sort S by DFS entry time (preorder).
            For i from 0 to len(S)-1:
                Add the nodes on the path from S[i] to S[i+1] (including LCA(S[i], S[i+1])? Actually, we can do the union of the paths from S[0] to S[1], S[1] to S[2], ... and S[len(S)-1] to S[0]? But that might include too many. Alternatively, we can do:

            It is known that: the minimal Steiner tree for a set S in a tree is the union of the simple paths between the nodes that are adjacent in the entire DFS traversal of S? Actually, we can do:

            T = set()
            Let S_sorted = sorted(S, key=preorder_index)
            For i in range(len(S)):
                T = T ∪ path(S_sorted[i], S_sorted[(i+1)%len(S)])
            Then the Steiner tree is T? But this is the entire cycle? Actually, we can do without the last edge? We don't need the cycle. Alternatively, we can take:

            T = set()
            For i in range(len(S)-1):
                T = T ∪ path(S_sorted[i], S_sorted[i+1])
            Then also add the path from the last to the first? Actually, that would form a cycle. We don't want that.

            Actually, the standard method is: 
                T = set()
                Sort S by DFS entry time.
                For i in range(len(S)-1):
                    T = T ∪ path(S_sorted[i], S_sorted[i+1])
                Then add the path from the first to the last? No, that is not necessary. Actually, the minimal Steiner tree is the union of the paths from the first node to the second, then the second to the third, etc., but that might not cover the entire set? 

            Alternatively, we can use the fact that the minimal Steiner tree is the union of the simple paths between the pairs (S_sorted[0], S_sorted[1]), (S_sorted[1], S_sorted[2]), ... (S_sorted[k-2], S_sorted[k-1]) and then we also have to include the LCA's? Actually, we can note that the entire Steiner tree is the union of the simple paths between every consecutive pair in the sorted DFS order and then the entire set of nodes that appear in these paths? But that might be redundant. Actually, we can compute the entire Steiner tree by:

                nodes = set(S)
                for i in range(len(S)-1):
                    nodes = nodes ∪ nodes_on_path(S_sorted[i], S_sorted[i+1])

                But then we also need the path from the last to the first? Actually, we don't: the entire Steiner tree is the union of the paths from the first node to the second, the second to the third, ... and the last to the first? That would be a cycle. Instead, we can do:

                Actually, the minimal Steiner tree is the union of the paths from the first node to the second, the second to the third, ... and then the last node to the first? That would be a cycle and not a tree. Alternatively, we can use:

                It is known that: the minimal Steiner tree for S in a tree is the entire set of nodes that are in the union of the simple paths between the two nodes that are the diameter of S? Actually, no: the Steiner tree for S is the union of the simple paths between every pair of nodes in S? That would be too expensive.

  Actually, there is a simpler way: since the set S is small (K<=50), we can compute the Steiner tree by:

      - Start with the set of nodes: S.
      - Then repeatedly add the least common ancestors of pairs until we have a tree? Actually, we can do:

          Let V = S.
          While there are at least two nodes in V, take two nodes and replace them by their LCA? Actually, that is not standard.

  Alternatively, we can use the following: the minimal Steiner tree for S is the set of all nodes that lie on at least one simple path between two nodes in S. We can compute:

      Let V = S.
      Mark all nodes in S.
      Then for every pair (u, v) in S, we mark every node on the path from u to v? That is O(K^2) and K<=50 -> 1275 pairs, and each path can be O(N). Then the union might be large, but we are not storing the entire set? Actually, we don't need the entire set of nodes explicitly, we just need to consider them as candidate assembly points.

  But note: we have Q up to 5000. 5000 * 1275 = 6,375,000 which is acceptable? But each path might be long (up to 100,000) and we are storing the entire set? That would be too heavy in memory and time.

  We need a better approach.

Alternative Insight:

  The problem is: minimize the sum of distances from a set S to a point x (which is any node). In trees, the point that minimizes the sum of distances is called the median. The median in a tree has the property that it lies on the path between the two farthest nodes (the diameter) of the set S? Actually, the median is a node such that if we root the tree at the median, no subtree has more than |S|/2 robots? That is the standard for the 1-median.

  However, note: the median in a tree is a node such that the total distance is minimized. And we can compute the total distance for a candidate median without having to iterate over every candidate? Actually, we can compute the total distance for the entire set S to a candidate node x by:

      total = 0
      for each u in S:
          total += dist(x, u)

  But we cannot iterate over every candidate node in the entire tree (100,000 per query, and 5000 queries -> 5000*100000 = 500e6 which might be borderline in Pyton/C++? But note: each dist query is O(logN) for LCA -> 500e6 * log(100000) which is 500e6 * 17 = 8.5e9, too slow).

  Therefore, we must restrict candidate points. We know that the median must lie on the Steiner tree. But the Steiner tree for a set S of size K in a tree has at most (2*K-1) nodes? Actually, the Steiner tree for a set S in a tree is the union of the simple paths between the nodes in S, and it is a tree. The number of nodes in the Steiner tree is at most (number of edges in the Steiner tree + 1) and the number of edges is the sum of the distances along the Steiner tree. But we can also see: the Steiner tree has at most (2*K - 1) nodes? Why? Because we start with K nodes, and we add at most K-1 additional nodes (the LCA's that are not in S) to connect them? Actually, the Steiner tree is a tree with at most 2*K-1 nodes? 

  How to compute the Steiner tree nodes? We can do:

      Step 1: Sort the set S by DFS entry time (precomputed during the DFS for the entire tree).
      Step 2: Let T be a set initially containing all nodes in S.
      Step 3: For i from 0 to len(S)-1, add the LCA of S[i] and S[i+1] (with S[-1] and S[0] as well? Actually, we don't need the last one?).

      Actually, the standard method to compute the Steiner tree nodes is:

          T = S
          Sort T by the DFS entry time (preorder index).
          For i in range(len(T)-1):
              Add the LCA(T[i], T[i+1]) to T.
          Then also add the LCA of the last and the first? Actually, we don't. Then we take the union and remove duplicates.

      Then the Steiner tree is the set T (but we also need the nodes on the paths? Actually, the above only gives the "key" nodes: the original set and the LCA's of consecutive pairs. Then the entire Steiner tree is the union of the simple paths between consecutive nodes in the sorted T (by DFS order). But note: the set T we have now (which has at most 2*K-1 nodes) is the set of nodes that we need to consider? Actually, no: the entire Steiner tree is the union of the paths between the nodes in T? But we have the key nodes, and then the entire Steiner tree is the union of the paths between consecutive nodes in the sorted T? Actually, the set T (the original set and the LCA's) might not be the entire Steiner tree? For example, if we have three nodes that form a Y-shape, then the LCA of the first and the second might be the center, and the LCA of the second and third might be the center again? Then we have the center. Then the Steiner tree is the union of the three branches? But we haven't added the nodes on the branches? 

  However, note: we don't need the entire Steiner tree, we only need the candidate nodes that are in the Steiner tree? Actually, the median must be one of the nodes in the Steiner tree? Actually, no: consider a star with three leaves: S = {a, b, c} and the center o. The Steiner tree is the entire star: nodes {a,b,c,o}. The median is o. But note: the Steiner tree we built above by taking the LCA's of consecutive pairs in the DFS order might not include the entire Steiner tree? Actually, the set T (after adding the LCA's) is the set of "key" nodes that are the branching points. Then the entire Steiner tree is the union of the paths between the nodes in T? But we don't have that explicitly. 

  Alternatively, we can consider: the candidate median must be one of the nodes that lie on the path between the two nodes u and v that are the diameter of S? Actually, the median minimizes the sum of distances and lies on the path between the two farthest points? Not necessarily: consider a tree that is a chain: 1-2-3-4, and S = {1,2,4}. The diameter is from 1 to 4. The median should be 2: because 
      dist(1,2)=0? Wait: 
      if we choose 1: total = 0 + 1 (for 2) + 3 (for 4) = 4.
      choose 2: total = 1 (for 1) + 0 + 2 (for 4) = 3.
      choose 3: total = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.
      choose 4: total = 3+2+0=5.
      So the median is 2, which is on the path from 1 to 4.

  But also consider: a tree that is a star: center o and leaves a, b, c, d. Let S = {a,b,c,d}. Then the median is o. The diameter of S is between any two leaves? Then the path of the diameter is from a to b, which is a-o-b. The median o is on that path.

  Therefore, the median must lie on the path between the two farthest nodes (the diameter) of the set S.

  So we can do:

      Step 1: For the set S, find two nodes u and v that form the diameter of S (max distance between any two in S).
        - How? 
            u0 = arbitrary node in S.
            u = the node in S farthest from u0.
            v = the node in S farthest from u.
        Then the diameter is the path from u to v.

      Step 2: Consider every node on the path from u to v as a candidate for the assembly point. Then compute the total distance for that candidate and take the minimum.

      How many nodes are on the path? The length of the path (number of edges) is d, then the number of nodes is d+1. The diameter d can be up to 100,000? But note: the entire tree has 100,000 nodes. However, the set S is small (K<=50) but the path between u and v might be long. And we have Q up to 5000. Then worst-case total candidate points over all queries: 5000 * (length of the longest path) which could be 5000 * 100000 = 500e6, which is too slow.

  Therefore, we cannot iterate over every node on the path.

Alternative Insight:

  We know that the function f(x) = sum_{s in S} dist(s, x) is convex along the path from u to v? Actually, it is piecewise linear and convex. Therefore, we can ternary search along the path? 

  Steps:

      Let P be the path from u to v (as a list of nodes). We can get the path by:
          w = u, then while w != v, move w to parent of w (but that is backward)? Actually, we can store the entire path by:

          path_nodes = []
          Let w = LCA(u, v) and then we can break the path into two parts: from u to w and from w to v? Actually, we can get the entire path as the nodes from u to w (excluding w) and then from w to v? But we include w once.

          Actually, we can get the path by:

            path_uv = []
            a = u, b = v
            Let L = LCA(u, v)
            Move a up until L, then move b up until L? Then combine: [u ... L] and then reverse of [L ... v] without duplicating L? Actually, we can do:

            path1 = [u]
            while u != L:
                u = parent[u] (using the binary lifting table, we can jump, but we need the entire path? Actually, we can store the entire path by moving step by step? But that is O(d) per path and d can be 100000. And we have up to 5000 queries? Then worst-case total length of all paths we traverse is 5000*100000 = 500e6, which is acceptable? Actually, worst-case the tree is a chain and the diameter of the entire tree is 100000, and we have 5000 queries, then 5000*100000 = 500e6 which is acceptable in C++ but in Python it might be borderline? But note: the problem constraints say that the entire tree has up to 100,000 nodes, but the set S is small, but the path between u and v might be long? However, the entire tree has 100,000 nodes, so the diameter of the entire tree is at most 100,000. But we are doing this for each query? 5000 * 100000 = 500e6 which is 500 million operations, which might be acceptable in C++ but in Python? The problem time limit is 2 seconds. 500e6 operations in 2 seconds is too slow for Python, but we are in C++? But the problem statement does not specify the language, but we are writing pseudocode. However, we must design an efficient solution.

  But note: the set S has only K nodes (K<=50), and the path we are considering is the path between two nodes in S? Actually, the entire path from u to v might be long, but we don't need to iterate over every node? We can use a ternary search that does O(log(d)) steps? 

  How to ternary search on the path?

      We note that the path from u to v is a simple path (a chain). The function f(x) = total distance from S to x is convex on this chain? Actually, it is convex: as we move along the chain, the distance to the nodes in S that are on the left of the chain decreases and to the right increases? But the set S might not lie entirely on the chain? 

      However, the function f along the chain is convex? Why? Because the distance from a fixed node s to a point x on the chain is the absolute difference in the positions? Actually, we can assign an integer coordinate for each node on the chain: let the chain be v0=u, v1, v2, ..., vd = v. Then the position of vi is i. Then the distance from a node s to vi is: 
          dist(s, vi) = dist(s, v0) + i   ??? 
      Actually, no: the entire tree is not a chain. But we are only considering the chain? The function f(vi) = sum_{s in S} [ dist(s, v0) + i - 2 * overlap? ] -> no, it's not linear.

  Actually, we can compute f(x) for a node x on the chain without iterating over the entire set S? We can precompute the entire tree's distances? Actually, we precomputed the depth. Then:

          f(x) = sum_{s in S} [ depth[s] + depth[x] - 2 * depth[LCA(s, x)] ]

  But note: we can precompute the depth for the entire tree. Then to compute f(x) for one x, we need to compute the LCA for each s in S? That is O(K * logN) per candidate. Then if we do ternary search for O(log(d)) candidates, then per query: O( log(d) * K * logN ). Since d <= N <= 100000, log(d) is about 17, and K<=50, logN=17 -> 17 * 50 * 17 = 14450 per candidate? Actually, we are doing O(K) per candidate (each LCA is O(1) if we use a precomputed LCA table? Actually, we precomputed a table for binary lifting, then LCA is O(logN).) Then per candidate: O(K * logN). Then for O(log(d)) candidates: O(K * logN * log(d)) per query.

  Then total for Q queries: Q * (K * logN * log(d)) <= 5000 * 50 * 17 * 17 = 5000 * 50 * 289 = 5000 * 14450 = 72,250,000, which is acceptable.

  Steps for one query:

      Step 1: Find the diameter endpoints u and v in the set S (K is the size of S).
          u0 = S[0]
          u = the node in S that is farthest from u0 (by computing dist(u0, s) for every s in S -> O(K * logN))
          v = the node in S that is farthest from u (again, O(K * logN))

      Step 2: Get the path from u to v as a list of nodes? Actually, we don't want the entire list (which might be long) but we want to do ternary search on the path. How?

          We can represent the path as a sequence of nodes? But the length d might be large. Instead, we can do ternary search without explicitly storing the entire path? We can use the following:

          We know the endpoints u and v. We can define a function that, given a fractional index (or two indices) along the path, returns the node at a certain position? But we don't have the entire path stored. Alternatively, we can use the following:

          We note that the path from u to v is a continuous sequence. We can use a binary lifting style to jump to the k-th node from u? Actually, we can get the k-th node from u by:

            Let L = LCA(u, v)
            Let d1 = depth[u] - depth[L]   (the distance from u to L)
            Let d2 = depth[v] - depth[L]   (the distance from v to L)

            Then the entire path has length d = d1 + d2.

          We want to get the node that is at a distance t from u (0<=t<=d). How?

            If t <= d1, then we are on the u->L part: we can climb from u up t steps.
            Else, we are on the L->v part: we climb from v up (d - t) steps? Actually, from L we go down? But the tree is not rooted at L. Alternatively, we can:

            We can precompute parent pointers for binary lifting. Then to get the t-th node from u:

                if t <= d1:
                    node = climb(u, t)   // climb from u up t steps (towards the root)
                else:
                    // we are going beyond L: we need to go from L to v: the remaining steps is t - d1, so we need to go from L to v by going (t-d1) steps? But note: from L to v we have d2 steps. Actually, we can get the node from v: we need to climb from v up (d2 - (t - d1)) steps? 

                Actually, the entire path: 
                    u = n0, n1, n2, ... n_{d1} = L, then n_{d1+1} = parent[L]? No, the path from u to v is: u -> parent[u] -> ... -> L, then L -> child of L that is in the direction of v -> ... -> v.

                Actually, we have stored the entire tree. We can store parent pointers. But we can also store the next node from L to v? Actually, we can precompute the next node on the path from u to v? Alternatively, we can store an array for the entire path? But the path might be long (100000) and we have 5000 queries, worst-case total memory 5000*100000 = 500e6 integers? That is 500e6 * 4 = 2e9 bytes = 2 GB, which is over the memory limit (256MB).

          Therefore, we avoid storing the entire path.

      Step 3: Ternary search on the integer segment [0, d] (the distance from u). We have a function g(t) = total distance from S to the node at distance t from u (along the path to v).

          How to compute g(t) without storing the entire path? 

            Step 3a: Compute the node at position t: 
                Let L = LCA(u, v)
                d1 = depth[u] - depth[L]
                d2 = depth[v] - depth[L]

                if t <= d1:
                    x = climb(u, t)   // climb t steps from u towards the root (which is the direction of L)
                else:
                    // t - d1 steps from L towards v? But note: from L to v, we are going down? Actually, we are going from u to v: the path is continuous. How to get the node at distance t from u? 

                    // Alternatively, we can get the node at distance (d1+d2 - t) from v? Actually, the node at distance t from u is at distance (d - t) from v? Yes, because the entire path has length d.

                    // But note: we can also express: 
                    //   Let x be the node at distance t from u. Then the distance from x to v is d - t.

                    // However, we need the node x. We can also compute the distance from u to x is t, and from x to v is d - t. But we need the node x.

                    // Actually, we can compute x by:
                    //   x = climb(v, d - t)   // because the distance from v to x is d - t? But the entire path is from u to v. Then the node at distance t from u is the same as the node at distance (d-t) from v? 

                    // But note: the path is symmetric. However, we have to be cautious: the path from u to v is unique. We can also compute:

                    //   Alternatively, we can note: the node x is the unique node such that dist(u, x)=t and dist(x, v)=d-t.

                    //   How to compute x? We can use the fact that the node x must be on the path. We can compute the LCA between u and v to get L. Then if t <= d1, then we are on the u->L part. Otherwise, we are on the L->v part? Actually, we already did that.

                    //   So if t <= d1:
                    //        x = climb(u, t)
                    //   else:
                    //        we need to go from L to v: the number of steps from L to x is (t - d1). But from L to v we have d2 steps. How to go from L to v? Actually, we can go from v up (d2 - (t - d1)) steps? 

                    //        x = climb(v, d2 - (t - d1))   ??? Let me check: 
                    //        The distance from L to v is d2. We want to go (t - d1) steps from L towards v? That is the same as going from v up (d2 - (t - d1)) steps? 

                    //        Actually, we want the node that is (t - d1) steps from L towards v. That is the same as the node that is (d2 - (t - d1)) steps from v? No, it's the opposite. 

                    //        Instead, we can do: 
                    //            steps_from_v = d2 - (t - d1)   -> then x = climb(v, steps_from_v)   // because we are going from v towards the root (to L) by steps_from_v steps? Then we end up at the node that is (t-d1) steps from L (towards v). 

                    //        Example: t = d1 + 1: then steps_from_v = d2 - 1 -> then we go from v up 1 step? Then we are at the parent of v? But we want the node that is 1 step from L towards v? Actually, if we go from v up (d2-1) steps we get the node that is adjacent to L? Then we are at the node that is one step from L? But then we are at the node that is one step from L? Actually, that is correct: the node at distance d1+1 from u is the first node after L in the path to v.

                    //        But note: the entire path: u -> ... -> L (d1 steps) -> next_node (d1+1) -> ... -> v (d1+d2 steps). So the node at t=d1+1 is the next_node. How to get that? 

                    //        Alternatively, we can compute: 
                    //            Let x = climb(v, d2 - (t - d1)) 
                    //        But wait: if t = d1, then we get x = climb(v, d2 - 0) = v? That is not correct: we want L at t=d1.

                    //        Actually, we want:
                    //          if t==d1: then x = L.
                    //          if t = d1+1: then x = the child of L that is on the path to v? Actually, we can also compute the k-th node from v? 

                    //        Alternatively, we can store the entire path in a linked list? But we don't want to store the entire path.

            However, we have a binary lifting table. We can get the k-th parent. But to get the node at a specific offset from u along the path to v, we can:

                Let d = d1 + d2   [the entire path length]
                We want the node x such that the distance from u to x is t.

                We can compute the distance from u to x: t, so we can also compute the depth of x? 

                    depth[x] = depth[u] - t   [if we are going up from u to L]? But if we are going beyond L, then we go down? Actually, from L to v we are going down? 

                Actually, the entire path is not necessarily going up then down? It is: from u to L (going up to the root) and then from L to v (going down). But we don't know the depth of x? 

            Instead, we can use the following:

                We know that the node x must be on the path from u to v. We can compute the node x by:

                  if t <= d1:
                      x = climb(u, t)   // using the parent table: we can jump in O(logN) time.
                  else:
                      // then we are on the segment from L to v: we have gone d1 steps to L, and then we need to go (t - d1) steps from L to v. But note: from L to v, we are going down? How to get the node that is (t-d1) steps from L towards v? 

                      // Actually, we can use the fact that the path from L to v is the same as the path from v to L but reversed? We have a parent table that goes up, but we don't have a child pointer? 

                      // How to go from L to v? We know that the path from L to v has d2 steps. We want the node that is (t-d1) steps from L? That is the same as the node that is (d2 - (t-d1)) steps from v? Then we can get that node by climbing from v up (d2 - (t-d1)) steps? 

                      // Example: t = d1 -> then (t-d1)=0 -> we climb from v up d2 steps? -> that is L? -> correct.
                      // t = d1+1: we climb from v up (d2-1) steps -> that is the parent of v? But wait: the path from L to v: L -> n1 -> ... -> v. The distance from L to v is d2. The node at step 1 from L is n1. The distance from n1 to v is d2-1. So to get n1 from v, we go up (d2-1) steps? 

                      // So: x = climb(v, d2 - (t - d1))

            Therefore, we have:

                d1 = depth[u] - depth[L]
                d2 = depth[v] - depth[L]
                if t <= d1:
                    x = climb(u, t)   // climb t steps from u (towards the root)
                else:
                    x = climb(v, d2 - (t - d1))

            But note: the entire path length d = d1+d2, and t in [0, d] (we consider the node at t=0: u, t=d: v).

            However, we must ensure that we can climb in O(logN) time. The function climb(u, t) can be implemented with the binary lifting table: we break t into binary representation and use the parent table.

      Step 3b: Compute g(t) = total distance from S to x.

          We have the node x. Then we compute:

              g(t) = 0
              for each s in S:
                  g(t) += dist(s, x)   // which can be computed by: depth[s] + depth[x] - 2 * depth[LCA(s, x)]

          This step is O(K * logN) because each LCA takes O(1) if we use a method with O(1) LCA? Actually, we precomputed a binary lifting table for LCA, which is O(logN). So per candidate: O(K * logN).

      Step 3c: Ternary search on t in the range [0, d] (integer). We do:

          low = 0, high = d
          while (high - low > 2):
              mid1 = low + (high-low)//3
              mid2 = high - (high-low)//3
              g1 = g(mid1)
              g2 = g(mid2)
              if g1 < g2:
                  high = mid2
              else:
                  low = mid1

          Then evaluate g(t) for t in [low, high] and take the minimum.

      Step 4: Output the minimum g(t) found.

  However, note: the function g(t) is convex? On a chain, the function f(x) = sum_{s in S} dist(s, x) is convex? Yes, because the distance function is convex on a chain. Therefore, ternary search is valid.

  But note: the entire tree is not a chain, but we are restricting the assembly point to the chain (the path from u to v). And the optimal assembly point lies on this chain. Therefore, we are guaranteed to find the minimum.

  But note: the chain is a continuous path, and the distance function is unimodal? Actually, it is convex: the function f is convex because it is the sum of convex functions (each dist(s, x) is convex: the absolute value function along the chain). 

  Therefore, the algorithm for one query:

      Precomputation: 
          Precomputed for the entire tree: depth[1..N], and a parent table for binary lifting (for LCA and climbing).

      For the set S of K robots:

          Step 1: Find the diameter endpoints u and v:
              u0 = S[0]
              u = u0
              for each s in S: 
                  d = dist(u0, s)   // we can compute by: depth[u0] + depth[s] - 2*depth[LCA(u0,s)]
              then u = the s with maximum d.

              Then v = u0 replaced by u: for each s in S: 
                  d = dist(u, s)
              then v = the s with maximum d.

          Step 2: Let L = LCA(u, v)
          Step 3: Compute d1 = depth[u] - depth[L], d2 = depth[v] - depth[L], d_total = d1+d2.

          Step 4: Ternary search on t in [0, d_total] (integer) for the function g(t) defined as:

              if t <= d1:
                  x = climb(u, t)
              else:
                  x = climb(v, d2 - (t - d1))

              g(t) = 0
              for each s in S:
                  g(t) += dist(s, x)   // which is depth[s] + depth[x] - 2 * depth[LCA(s,x)]

          Step 5: Output the minimum g(t) found.

  Complexity per query: 
      Step 1: O(K * logN) for the two farthest searches (each dist is O(logN) for LCA).
      Step 2: LCA(u, v): O(logN)
      Step 3: O(1)
      Step 4: Ternary search: O(log(d_total)) iterations, each iteration O(K * logN). Since d_total <= 100000, log(d_total) ~ 17.
          Total: O(17 * K * logN) <= 17 * 50 * 17 = 14450 per query.

      Then Q queries: 5000 * 14450 = 72,250,000 operations (each operation being a few arithmetic operations and a binary lifting climb for the candidate and then for each s in S: an LCA). 

      But note: the LCA for a fixed pair (s,x) is O(logN). So for each candidate and each s: O(logN). Then for one candidate: O(K * logN) = 50 * 17 = 850. Then 17 candidates per query: 17 * 850 = 14450.

      Therefore, total operations: 5000 * 14450 = 72.25e6, which is acceptable in C++ (and in Pyton if optimized in PyPy or with pypy? but worst-case in Python it might be borderline in 2 seconds? But note: the problem time limit is 2 seconds and 72e6 operations in Python might be borderline? However, we are writing a solution that should run in C++ as well? The problem doesn't specify the language. But we are only required to write pseudocode? Actually, the problem statement says "write an editorial", so we are describing the algorithm.

  However, we can optimize by precomputing the LCA for all pairs? Actually, we are computing LCA for (s,x) for each s and each candidate x. There are 17 candidates per query and 50 s per query: 5000 * 17 * 50 = 4,250,000 LCA queries? We precomputed a binary lifting table for LCA, so each LCA is O(logN) = 17 operations? Then total operations: 4,250,000 * 17 = 72,250,000 operations (which is about 72 million) and then we have the climbing for each candidate: 5000 * 17 = 85,000 climbs, each climb is O(logN)=17, so 85,000 * 17 = 1,445,000, which is negligible.

  Therefore, the total operations is about 72 million, which is acceptable in 2 seconds in C++. In Python it might be borderline, but note that the problem constraints might require a C++ implementation. However, the problem says "output the editorial", so we are describing the algorithm.

  But note: we must be cautious: the function g(t) might not be strictly convex? But it is convex. However, ternary search on integers for a convex function is standard.

  Let me test on a small chain: 
      Tree: 1-2-3-4, S = {1,4}. 
      Step 1: 
          u0=1, then the farthest from 1 is 4 (distance 3). Then from 4, the farthest is 1 (distance 3). So diameter from 1 to 4.
      Step 2: L = LCA(1,4)=1? Actually, if we root at 1, then depth: 
          1:0, 2:1, 3:2, 4:3.
          LCA(1,4)=1 -> d1 = depth[1]-depth[1]=0, d2=depth[4]-depth[1]=3, d_total=3.
      Then we consider t in [0,3]:
          t=0: x = climb(1,0)=1 -> total distance = dist(1,1)+dist(4,1)=0+3=3.
          t=1: x = climb(4, 3 - (1-0)) = climb(4, 2) -> which is 4's parent's parent: 2 -> total distance = dist(1,2)+dist(4,2)=1+2=3.
          t=2: x = climb(4, 3 - (2-0)) = climb(4,1)=3 -> total = dist(1,3)+dist(4,3)=2+1=3.
          t=3: x = climb(4, 3 - (3-0)) = climb(4,0)=4 -> total = 0+3=3.

      But wait, the minimum should be 3? Actually, it is constant? 

      However, in this set S, the minimum total is 3? 

      Alternatively, the minimum total rail usage: 
          If we choose 1: 0 (for 1) + 3 (for 4) = 3.
          If we choose 2: 1+2=3.
          If we choose 3: 2+1=3.
          If we choose 4: 3+0=3.

      So it is constant.

  Another test: S = {1,2,4} in the chain 1-2-3-4.
      Step 1: 
          u0=1: 
            dist(1,1)=0, dist(1,2)=1, dist(1,4)=3 -> so u=4.
          then from 4: 
            dist(4,1)=3, dist(4,2)=2, dist(4,4)=0 -> so v=1 (or 2? wait: 3>2, so v=1? Actually, we break ties arbitrarily? Then v=1.
      Then the path from 4 to 1: 4->3->2->1. 
      d_total = 3.
      Then we consider t in [0,3]:
          t=0: x=4 -> total = dist(1,4)+dist(2,4)+dist(4,4) = 3+2+0 = 5.
          t=1: x=3 -> total = dist(1,3)+dist(2,3)+dist(4,3) = 2+1+1 = 4.
          t=2: x=2 -> total = 1+0+2 = 3.
          t=3: x=1 -> total = 0+1+3 = 4.

      Minimum is 3 at t=2.

  So the algorithm works.

  However, note: the diameter might not be symmetric? We found u and v by taking the farthest from an arbitrary node? But that is the standard method for the diameter of a set in a tree.

  But note: the set S might not be connected? But the diameter we compute is the two nodes that are the farthest apart in S? Then the path between u and v is the diameter.

  Therefore, the solution:

      Precomputation:
          Precompute depth and parent table for binary lifting (for 0..max_log, max_log = ceil(log2(N))).

      Steps for binary lifting:

          Let parent[0][u] = the direct parent of u (for the root, parent[0][root]=0 or itself? We set the root as node 1?).
          For j in range(1, max_log+1):
              parent[j][u] = parent[j-1][ parent[j-1][u] ]

          Then LCA(u, v):
              Bring u and v to the same depth: 
                  if depth[u] < depth[v], swap(u, v)
                  Lift u up to depth of v: 
                      d = depth[u] - depth[v]
                      for j in range(max_log, -1, -1):
                          if d & (1<<j):
                              u = parent[j][u]
                  if u==v: return u
                  for j in range(max_log, -1, -1):
                      if parent[j][u] != parent[j][v]:
                          u = parent[j][u]
                          v = parent[j][v]
                  return parent[0][u]

      Precomputation of depth: do a BFS/DFS from the root (node 1).

      Then for each query:

          Read K, then K nodes: S.

          Step 1: If K==0, output 0? But K>=1.

          Step 2: Find u0 = S[0]. Then for each node in S, compute the distance from u0 to s. Then set u = the node in S with the maximum distance (if multiple, any). Then set v = the node in S with the maximum distance from u.

          Step 3: Compute L = LCA(u, v)
          Step 4: d1 = depth[u]-depth[L], d2 = depth[v]-depth[L], d_total = d1+d2.

          Step 5: Define a function g(t) for t in [0, d_total] (integer):

                if t <= d1:
                    x = climb(u, t)   // climb t steps from u: using the binary lifting table: 
                         temp = u
                         for j in range(0, max_log+1) if the j-th bit of t is set: temp = parent[j][temp]
                else:
                    x = climb(v, d2 - (t-d1))   // climb (d2 - (t-d1)) steps from v

                total = 0
                for each s in S:
                    total += (depth[s] + depth[x] - 2 * depth[LCA(s, x)])
                return total

          Step 6: Ternary search for t in [0, d_total] to minimize g(t).

          Step 7: Output the minimum g(t) found.

  However, note: we must avoid recalculating the entire g(t) for every candidate in the ternary search? Actually, we do calculate it for the candidates we choose. The ternary search only evaluates O(log(d_total)) candidates.

  But note: the function g(t) might be evaluated at two points per iteration? Then total evaluations: 2 * log2(d_total) + 2? Actually, we do about O(log(d_total)) evaluations.

  Let me code the ternary search:

        lo = 0
        hi = d_total
        while hi - lo > 2:
            d = hi - lo
            mid1 = lo + d//3
            mid2 = hi - d//3
            f1 = g(mid1)
            f2 = g(mid2)
            if f1 < f2:
                hi = mid2
            else:
                lo = mid1

        Then evaluate g at t = lo, lo+1, ..., hi and take the minimum.

  But note: the convex function might be flat? So we must check the entire segment [lo, hi] at the end? But the segment has at most 3 points? Actually, when hi-lo==2, we check 3 points: lo, lo+1, lo+2.

  Therefore, the total number of evaluations per query: about 2 * log3(d_total) + 3. Since d_total <= 100000, log3(100000) is about 10 (because 3^10 ~ 59000), so total about 23 evaluations.

  But wait: the while condition: while hi - lo > 2 -> then we do about log_{3/2}(d_total) iterations? Actually, the reduction per iteration is about 1/3? So the number of iterations is about log_{3/2}(d_total). For d_total=100000, log_{3/2}(100000) ~ 20? Then each iteration we do two evaluations? Then 40 evaluations? Then plus 3 at the end -> 43 evaluations per query? 

  Actually, we can do:

        iterations = 0
        while (hi - lo) > 2:
            mid1 = lo + (hi - lo) // 3
            mid2 = hi - (hi - lo) // 3
            f1 = g(mid1)
            f2 = g(mid2)
            if f1 < f2:
                hi = mid2
            else:
                lo = mid1
            iterations++

        Then we do min_{t=lo}^{hi} g(t)

        Total evaluations: 2 * iterations + (hi-lo+1) at the end. Since hi-lo+1 <= 3, and iterations is about O(log_{3/2}(d_total)). For d_total=100000, log_{3/2}(100000) is about 29? (because (3/2)^29 ~ 1e5). Then 2*29+3 = 61 evaluations per query? 

        Then total per query: 61 * (K * logN) = 61 * 50 * 17 = 51850 per query? Then 5000 * 51850 = 259,250,000 which is 259 million operations? 

        But note: each g(t) evaluation: we do K (<=50) LCA computations, each LCA is O(logN) (which we assume 17 operations). So per evaluation: 50*17 = 850 operations. Then 61*850 = 51850 per query? Then 5000*51850 = 259,250,000 operations. This is acceptable in C++ (about 259 million operations in 2 seconds: 130 million operations per second is typical for C++), but in Python it might be too slow.

  We need to optimize the LCA computations? Actually, we can precompute the entire set of candidate nodes for the ternary search? But note: the candidate nodes are different per query.

  Alternatively, we can use the method to compute the median without ternary search? 

      We know that the median minimizes the sum of distances. There is a known formula:

          total = sum_{s in S} depth[s] + K * depth[x] - 2 * sum_{s in S} depth[LCA(s, x)]

      But that doesn't help because we don't know x.

  Another idea: we can use virtual trees? Since the set S is small, we can build the virtual tree (Steiner tree) for S. Then we can do a DFS on the virtual tree? The virtual tree has O(K) nodes. Then we can compute the total distance for each node in the virtual tree? Then we iterate over the O(K) nodes? 

      Steps:

          Build the virtual tree for S: 
            Sort the set S by DFS order: let T = sorted(S, key=preorder_index)
            Then the virtual tree nodes: 
                V = { T[0], T[1], ..., T[K-1] } ∪ { LCA(T[i], T[i+1]) for i=0 to K-2 }   -> then remove duplicates.

          Then the virtual tree has at most 2*K-1 nodes.

          Then we can compute the total distance for each node in V? 

          How to compute the total distance for a node x? 
              total = 0
              for each s in S:
                  total += dist(s, x)   // which is O(K * logN) per x? 

          Then we iterate over at most 2*K-1 nodes? Then per query: O(K^2 * logN) = 50^2 * 17 = 50*50*17 = 42,500 per query? Then 5000 * 42500 = 212,500,000, which is 212.5 million, which is acceptable in C++.

      Therefore, we can do:

          Precomputation: 
            Precompute depth, parent table, and preorder index (and also the Euler Tour for LCA?).

          For each query:
            Read S.

            Step 1: Build the virtual tree node set V:
                V = set(S)
                Sort S by preorder index.
                for i in range(len(S)-1):
                    l = LCA(S[i], S[i+1])
                    V.add(l)

            Step 2: For each node in V, compute:
                total = 0
                for s in S:
                    total += dist(s, x)
                candidate_ans = min(candidate_ans, total)

            Step 3: Output candidate_ans.

      Why is this correct? Because the median (the optimal assembly point) must be in the virtual tree? Actually, the virtual tree is the minimal Steiner tree? And the median lies in the Steiner tree? So yes.

      How to compute dist(s,x)? We precomputed depth and LCA, so dist(s,x)=depth[s]+depth[x]-2*depth[LCA(s,x)].

      Complexity: |V| <= 2*K-1, so about 100 nodes per query. Then for each node in V, we iterate over S (size K) and compute the distance (which is O(logN) per dist). Then per query: O(K * |V| * logN) = O(K^2 * logN) = 50^2 * 17 = 42500 per query? Then 5000 * 42500 = 212.5e6, which is acceptable in C++ (212 million operations in 2 seconds? 100 million per second is typical in C++).

      But note: we have to compute the LCA for each pair (s,x). Actually, we are computing dist(s,x) which requires LCA(s,x). So per (s,x) pair: one LCA. The total number of pairs: |V| * |S| <= 100 * 50 = 5000 per query? Then 5000 queries * 5000 = 25e6 LCA computations? Each LCA is O(logN)=17, so 25e6 * 17 = 425e6 operations? That is 425 million operations, which might be borderline in 2 seconds in C++? But note: the LCA function is efficient (using binary lifting) and 425 million operations in C++ might be acceptable? (if each operation is a few instructions, then 425e6 * 10 instructions = 4.25e9, which is about 2 seconds in a 2 GHz machine?).

      Alternatively, we can precompute the LCA for all pairs? But we don't know which pairs (s,x) we will get. 

      But note: the set V is small. We can precompute the entire distance matrix for the nodes in V? Actually, we can compute the distances between every pair of nodes in V? Then we can use the formula for the sum of distances? But we need the sum of distances from each s in S to x, not the distances within V.

      However, we can use the following: we can precompute the entire distance from each s in S to each x in V? That is |S| * |V|, which is 50*100=5000 per query? Then 5000 queries: 25e6 pairs? Then 25e6 * 17 = 425e6 operations? Same as above.

      Therefore, we choose the virtual tree method.

      Steps for one query:

          V = set(S)
          sort S by preorder index
          for i in range(len(S)-1):
              l = LCA(S[i], S[i+1])
              V.add(l)

          ans = a big number
          for x in V:
              total = 0
              for s in S:
                  total += (depth[s] + depth[x] - 2 * depth[LCA(s,x)])
              if total < ans: ans = total

          output ans

      But note: the set V might include duplicates? We use a set so duplicates are removed.

      Precomputation for the entire tree: 
          Precompute depth and parent table for LCA (using binary lifting) and preorder index.

      How to get the preorder index? We do a DFS.

      The DFS for the entire tree: O(N). Then for each query, building V: 
          Sorting S: O(K logK) = 50*log50 ~ 50*6 = 300 per query -> total 5000*300 = 1.5e6, which is acceptable.
          Then adding the LCA for consecutive pairs: O(K) * O(logN) for each LCA -> 50 * 17 = 850 per query -> 5000*850=4.25e6.

      Then the inner loop: |V| * |S| * (cost per dist) = (at most 100) * 50 * 17 = 85,000 per query? Then 5000 * 85000 = 425e6, which is 425 million operations? 

      Total operations: 425e6 for the inner loop (the LCA computations) and 4.25e6 for building V. Then 425e6 dominates.

      But 425 million LCA operations? Actually, each LCA operation is O(logN)=17 steps? Then 425e6 * 17 = 7.225e9 operations? That is 7.2 billion operations? That is too slow for 2 seconds.

  We must optimize the inner loop.

  How to compute the total distance from a fixed node x to all s in S quickly? 

      total = |S| * depth[x] + (sum_{s in S} depth[s]) - 2 * (sum_{s in S} depth[LCA(s,x)])

      We can precompute for the entire tree the values, but the problem is that x is in V (which is built per query) and S is per query.

      Alternatively, we can precompute nothing? But we are stuck with the inner loop.

  Another idea: we can use a tree dynamic programming method on the virtual tree? 

      Steps:

          Build the virtual tree (not just the nodes, but the edges). How to build the edges? We have the nodes V. Then we can build the tree by:

            1. Sort V by preorder index: V_sorted.
            2. Use a stack to build the tree: 
                stack = [V_sorted[0]]
                for i in range(1, len(V_sorted)):
                    u = V_sorted[i]
                    lca = LCA(u, stack[-1])
                    while len(stack) > 1 and depth[stack[-2]] >= depth[lca]:
                        connect stack[-2] and stack[-1], pop the stack
                    if stack[-1] != lca:
                        connect lca and stack[-1], pop the stack, push lca
                    push u

          Then we have the virtual tree.

          Then we can do a DFS on the virtual tree to compute the total distance? 

          We can compute:

            We want for each node x in the virtual tree: 
                f(x) = sum_{s in S} dist(s, x)

          How? 

            First, we can compute the number of robots in S that are in the subtree of each node in the virtual tree? But the virtual tree is built from the entire tree? Actually, the entire tree is static. We can do:

                Let cnt[x] = 1 if x is in the original set S (the robot locations) and 0 otherwise? But note: the virtual tree nodes might not be in S? So we need to propagate the counts?

            Actually, we can do:

                We assign an array for the virtual tree: 
                  cnt[x] = 1 if x is in the original set S, else 0.

                Then we can do a DFS on the virtual tree to aggregate the counts? But the virtual tree is built from the entire tree, and the edges are not the same as the original tree? Actually, the virtual tree is a compressed version. The edges in the virtual tree have weights (the distance in the original tree). 

            Then the function f(x) can be computed by:

                f(x) = f(parent) + (total_count - 2 * cnt_subtree(x)) * weight(x, parent)

            But wait: the standard tree distance shifting: 
                When moving from parent to child: the distance to every robot in the child's subtree decreases by the edge weight, and the others increase? 

            Actually, we can compute:

                Let f(root) = sum_{s in S} dist(s, root)

                Then for a child v of u (with edge weight w = dist(u,v) in the original tree? Actually, the edge in the virtual tree represents the entire path? The weight of the edge (u, v) in the virtual tree is the distance between u and v in the original tree.

                Then f(v) = f(u) + w * (cnt[u] - 2 * cnt[v])   -> but wait, this formula is for when we move one edge? Actually, we have:

                    f(v) = f(u) + w * ( (total_count - cnt_subtree(v)) - cnt_subtree(v) )
                         = f(u) + w * (total_count - 2 * cnt_subtree(v))

            But note: the entire set S is in the virtual tree? Actually, the virtual tree is the minimal tree that contains S and the LCA's. The original set S is included as leaves? Not necessarily: if a node in S is the LCA of two others, it might be internal? 

            How to compute the entire f(x) for the root? 

                We can compute the distance from the root (of the virtual tree) to each node in S? Then f(root) = sum_{s in S} dist(root, s)

            Then we can do a DFS to compute f(x) for every node in the virtual tree? 

          Steps:

              Step 1: Build the virtual tree (nodes and edges). The edges: for an edge (u, v) in the virtual tree, the weight w = |depth[u]-depth[v]|? Actually, no: if u is an ancestor of v, then the distance is depth[v]-depth[u]. But if they are not? Then the distance is depth[u] + depth[v] - 2*depth[LCA(u,v)]? But in the virtual tree, the edge (u, v) is only added if u is the parent of v? And u is the LCA of v and some other node? Actually, in the virtual tree, the parent-child relation is defined by the DFS stack, and the parent is the LCA? And the weight of the edge is depth[child] - depth[parent]? Actually, the entire path in the original tree is compressed? But the virtual tree edge (parent, child) has weight = depth[child] - depth[parent] (if the parent is an ancestor of the child).

              Step 2: Choose a root for the virtual tree (say the first node in V_sorted, or the node with the smallest depth?).

              Step 3: Do a DFS to compute:

                  total_count = |S|

                  We need to compute the size of the subtree in the virtual tree? But note: the virtual tree is a tree. We can compute:

                      cnt[x] = 1 if x is in the original set S, else 0, and then add the cnt from the children? But note: the virtual tree might have multiple branches? Actually, we do:

                          for child in children of x:
                              DFS(child)
                              cnt[x] += cnt[child]

                  Then compute f(root) = sum_{s in S} dist(s, root)   // we can compute by iterating over S? That is O(K) per virtual tree root? Then we do it once: O(K) for the entire virtual tree.

              Step 4: Then do a DFS to propagate f(x) to the children:

                  for each child v of x, with edge weight w (which is depth[v]-depth[x] if x is the parent of v in the virtual tree and x is an ancestor of v? But it is: because the virtual tree parent is the LCA which is an ancestor):

                      f(v) = f(x) + w * (total_count - 2 * cnt[v])

              Step 5: Then the answer is the minimum f(x) for x in V.

          How to compute f(root)? 

              f(root) = 0
              for each s in S:
                  f(root) += dist(s, root)

          Complexity: 
              Building the virtual tree: O(K * logK) (sorting) and O(K) for the stack.
              Computing f(root): O(K * logN) (for the dist(s,root) which is O(1) if we have depth? Actually, dist(s,root)=depth[s]+depth[root]-2*depth[LCA(s,root)]. But if root is the root of the virtual tree, which might not be the global root? 

              We can precompute LCA for all pairs (s, root) for the root of the virtual tree? But there are O(K) such s? Then O(K * logN) for one virtual tree.

          Then total per query: 
              Building virtual tree: O(K logK + K * logN) (for the LCA's in the virtual tree building) -> about 50*6 + 50*17 = 300+850=1150.
              Computing f(root): O(K * logN) = 50*17=850.
              Then the DFS to compute cnt: O(|V|) = 100.
              Then the DFS to propagate f(x): O(|V|) = 100.

          Then per query: about 2000 operations? Then 5000 queries: 5000*2000 = 10e6, which is acceptable.

          But note: the edge weight w for an edge (x, v) in the virtual tree is not depth[v]-depth[x]? Why? 

              In the virtual tree, if x is the parent of v, then x is an ancestor of v in the original tree? Yes, because x is the LCA of v and some other node. Therefore, the distance between x and v in the original tree is depth[v] - depth[x].

          Therefore, we can use w = depth[v] - depth[x].

          Steps for one query:

              V = set(S)
              sort S by preorder index
              for i in range(len(S)-1):
                  l = LCA(S[i], S[i+1])
                  V.add(l)
              V_sorted = sort V by preorder index

              Build the virtual tree (with edges) using the stack method.

              Let total_count = len(S)

              Choose a root for the virtual tree: the first node in V_sorted? Actually, the virtual tree may not be rooted. We can build an arbitrary tree? We need to assign parent-child relations.

              Then, we need to build an adjacency list for the virtual tree? From the stack method, we have added edges. We can store parent-child relationships? 

              Then, we can do:

                  # Step 1: compute cnt for each node: 
                  Create an array cnt for each node in V: initially, 1 if the node is in the original set S, else 0.

                  # We need to build a tree structure: we have the edges. We can pick the virtual tree root as the first node in V_sorted? Actually, the virtual tree may have a natural root (the global root might be in V? not necessarily). But we can pick any node? We can pick the node with the smallest depth? 

                  Alternatively, from the stack method, we have the entire tree. We can do a BFS/DFS to compute the parent-child relationships? Actually, from the stack method, we have built the tree. We have the edges. We can store an array of children for each node.

                  Then, do a DFS from the root (the node that has no parent? which is the first node in the virtual tree? Actually, the virtual tree built by the stack method: the first node is the first in the DFS order, and it is the deepest? Not necessarily. The node with the smallest depth is the root? 

                  We can choose the node in V that has the smallest depth as the root? 

                  Then, we build a tree: 

                      Let G be an empty graph for the virtual tree.
                      For each edge (u, v) we found during the virtual tree building, add an undirected edge.

                  Then we can root the tree at the node with the smallest depth.

              Then, do:

                  # Compute f(root) for the virtual tree root: 
                      f(root) = 0
                      for each s in S:
                          f(root) += dist(s, root)   # which is depth[s] + depth[root] - 2 * depth[LCA(s, root)]

                  # Then do a DFS to compute the cnt array (for the virtual tree):

                      def dfs(u, parent):
                          for v in children(u):
                              dfs(v, u)
                              cnt[u] += cnt[v]

                  # Then do a DFS to compute f for all nodes:

                      def dfs2(u, parent):
                          for v in children(u):
                              w = depth[v] - depth[u]   # because u is an ancestor of v? In the virtual tree, the parent is an ancestor? Yes.
                              f[v] = f[u] + w * (total_count - 2 * cnt[v])
                              dfs2(v, u)

                  # Then answer = min_{u in V} f[u]

          But note: the virtual tree might have a node that is not in the original tree? It is in the original tree.

          However, there is a catch: the virtual tree might have an edge that is not between an ancestor and a descendant? No, in the virtual tree, the parent is always an ancestor.

          But note: we built the virtual tree by the standard method, so the parent in the virtual tree is an ancestor in the original tree.

          Therefore, the weight w = depth[v] - depth[u] is the distance in the original tree.

          Complexity: 
              Building the virtual tree: O(K) for the stack.
              The DFS for cnt: O(|V|)
              The initial computation of f(root): O(K * logN)   (for the LCA for each s and the root)

          Total per query: O(K * logN) = 50*17=850 for f(root) and O(|V|) for the DFS's.

          Then 5000 queries: 5000 * 850 = 4.25e6, which is acceptable.

  Therefore, we choose the virtual tree method with dynamic programming.

  Steps for one query:

      Let K = number of robots, and the set S of K nodes.

      Step 1: 
          V = set(S)
          sort S by preorder index -> T
          for i in range(0, len(T)-1):
              l = LCA(T[i], T[i+1])
              V.add(l)

      Step 2: 
          V = list(V)
          sort V by preorder index -> V_sorted

      Step 3: Build the virtual tree:

          stack = []
          stack.append(V_sorted[0])
          graph = { node: [] for node in V_sorted }   # will store (neighbor, weight) or we can store parent-child? Actually, we store children.

          for i in range(1, len(V_sorted)):
              u = V_sorted[i]
              lca = LCA(u, stack[-1])

              # Now we pop until the stack has at most one node below lca?
              # But note: the stack is a path from the root to the current node? 
              while len(stack) > 1 and depth[stack[-2]] >= depth[lca]:
                  # connect stack[-2] and stack[-1] with weight = depth[stack[-1]] - depth[stack[-2]]? 
                  # But we will build the tree later? 
                  # Actually, we add an edge between stack[-2] and stack[-1]
                  parent_node = stack[-2]
                  child_node = stack[-1]
                  # add edge (parent_node, child_node) with weight = depth[child_node] - depth[parent_node]
                  # But we store in a graph: 
                  graph[parent_node].append(child_node)
                  graph[child_node].append(parent_node)
                  stack.pop()

              if stack and stack[-1] != lca:
                  # then lca is not stack[-1], so we add an edge between lca and stack[-1] and pop the last
                  parent_node = lca
                  child_node = stack[-1]
                  graph[parent_node].append(child_node)
                  graph[child_node].append(parent_node)
                  stack.pop()
                  stack.append(lca)
              stack.append(u)

          while len(stack) > 1:
              parent_node = stack[-2]
              child_node = stack[-1]
              graph[parent_node].append(child_node)
              graph[child_node].append(parent_node)
              stack.pop()

          Then the last node in the stack is the root of the virtual tree? Not necessarily, but we will choose the smallest depth as the root later.

      Step 4: Choose the root of the virtual tree: the node with the smallest depth in V_sorted? Actually, we can choose any node? We can pick the first node in V_sorted? Or the node that we did not pop? 

          Actually, the virtual tree might be built with an arbitrary structure. We can do:

          root = the node in V_sorted that has the smallest depth? 
          Then we build a tree from the graph by doing a BFS from that root.

      Step 5: 
          Mark the nodes in the original set S: 
              inS = a set (S)

          total_count = len(S)

          # We will do a BFS/DFS to set parent-child relationships in the virtual tree (rooted at the chosen root).

          Let's choose root = the node in V with the smallest depth. (If there are multiple, any.)

          Then do a BFS from the root to assign parent in the virtual tree and children.

          We also need to avoid cycles? The graph is a tree.

          Steps for BFS:

              from collections import deque
              q = deque([root])
              parent_virtual = {}
              depth_virtual = {}   # not necessary, we have the original depth? But we are using the original tree's depth.
              children_virtual = {node: [] for node in V}

              parent_virtual[root] = None
              while q:
                  u = q.popleft()
                  for v in graph[u]:
                      if v == parent_virtual.get(u, None):
                          continue
                      parent_virtual[v] = u
                      children_virtual[u].append(v)
                      q.append(v)

          Then we have a rooted virtual tree.

      Step 6: 
          Compute f(root) = 0
          for each s in S:
              f(root) += (depth[s] + depth[root] - 2 * depth[LCA(s, root)])

          Then compute cnt array for the virtual tree:

              cnt = {}
              for node in V:
                  cnt[node] = 1 if node in inS else 0

              # Do DFS to aggregate:
              stack = [root]
              order = []
              while stack:
                  u = stack.pop()
                  order.append(u)
                  for v in children_virtual[u]:
                      stack.append(v)
              # reverse order: from leaves to root
              order.reverse()
              for u in order:
                  for v in children_virtual[u]:
                      cnt[u] += cnt[v]

          Step 7: 
              # Compute f for all nodes:

              f = {}
              f[root] = computed above.

              stack = [root]
              while stack:
                  u = stack.pop()
                  for v in children_virtual[u]:
                      w = depth[v] - depth[u]   # because in the original tree, u is an ancestor of v? In the virtual tree, the parent is an ancestor? Yes.
                      f[v] = f[u] + w * (total_count - 2 * cnt[v])
                      stack.append(v)

          Step 8: 
              ans = min{ f[u] for u in V }
              output ans.

  But note: the virtual tree might have an edge (u,v) that is not a parent-child in the original tree? In our virtual tree building, the parent in the virtual tree is an ancestor in the original tree, so the weight w = depth[v] - depth[u] is correct.

  However, there is a catch: the virtual tree might not include the entire path between two nodes? But the dynamic programming formula relies on the virtual tree being a tree and the edges being the same as the original tree's ancestor-descendant? 

  Let me test on a small chain: 
        Tree: 1-2-3-4, S = {2,4}. 
        V = {2,4} ∪ { LCA(2,4) } = {2,4, LCA(2,4)}. 
        LCA(2,4)=2? (if we root at 1, then depth: 1:0, 2:1, 3:2, 4:3; LCA(2,4)=2? because 2 is an ancestor of 4).

        Then V = {2,4} -> we don't add 2 again? So V={2,4}. Then build the virtual tree:

          sort by preorder: [2,4] (assuming preorder: 1,2,3,4 -> then preorder of 2 is earlier than 4).

          stack = [2]
          for u=4:
              lca = LCA(4,2)=2.
              then we have stack=[2] and we then push 4? 
          Then after the for loop, stack=[2,4]. Then we pop: add edge (2,4) with weight = depth[4]-depth[2]=2.

          Then virtual tree: 2 connected to 4 with edge weight 2.

          Then choose root=2 (smallest depth? depth[2]=1, depth[4]=3 -> root=2).

          Then we build the tree: children_virtual[2] = [4], parent_virtual[4]=2.

          cnt: 
            2: inS? yes -> 1
            4: inS? yes -> 1
          Then aggregate: 
            order (reverse): [4,2] -> then for 4: no children, then for 2: cnt[2] = 1 + cnt[4] = 2.

          f(2) = dist(2,2) + dist(4,2) = 0 + (3-1) = 2? Actually, depth[4]=3, depth[2]=1, LCA(4,2)=2, so dist(4,2)=3+1-2*1=2. So f(2)=0+2=2.

          Then for v=4: 
              w = depth[4]-depth[2]=2.
              f[4] = f[2] + 2 * (2 - 2*cnt[4]) = 2 + 2*(2-2*1) = 2 + 2*(0)=2.

          Then the minimum f is 2.

          But the minimum total usage: 
             if assembly at 2: 0+2=2.
             at 4: 2+0=2.
             at 1: dist(2,1)=1, dist(4,1)=3 -> 4.
             at 3: dist(2,3)=1, dist(4,3)=1 -> 2.
          We missed 3! 

  Why? The node 3 is not in the virtual tree. But the virtual tree for S={2,4} is the union of the paths between 2 and 4? That is the path 2-3-4. But we only included 2 and 4? And the LCA(2,4)=2, so we didn't add any other node.

  But the virtual tree building method we used only includes the nodes in the set V = {2,4} and the LCA of consecutive pairs in the sorted preorder. For (2,4): LCA=2, which is already in V. So V={2,4}. Then the virtual tree is built with a single edge between 2 and 4, but the weight is 2 (which is the entire distance in the original tree). But the node 3 is not in the virtual tree.

  However, the median (3) is not in the virtual tree? But the virtual tree is the minimal subtree that contains S, which is the path 2-3-4. So it should include 3? 

  But our virtual tree node set V did not include 3. Why? Because we only added the LCA of consecutive pairs in the sorted preorder. The LCA of 2 and 4 is 2, not 3. So we never added 3.

  This is a known issue: the standard virtual tree only includes the nodes that are the LCA of consecutive pairs in the sorted preorder. But the entire minimal Steiner tree is the path from 2 to 4, which includes 3. However, the virtual tree as a node set only includes the given set and the LCA's of consecutive pairs. In this case, we only added 2 and 4, and the LCA(2,4) is 2, which is already in the set. So we did not add 3.

  How to get 3? We need to add the LCA's of every pair? That is not efficient.

  Alternatively, the virtual tree should include all nodes that are the LCA of any two nodes in S? But that is O(K^2) and K=50 -> 1275, which is acceptable? Then |V|<=1275, which is acceptable.

  But the standard virtual tree only needs the consecutive pairs in the DFS order? But in our example, the node 3 is the LCA of 2 and 4? Actually, in the entire tree, the LCA of 2 and 4 is 2? if the tree is rooted at 1, then the LCA of 2 and 4 is 2, because 2 is an ancestor of 4.

  So the node 3 is not the LCA of any two nodes in S. Therefore, it is not in the virtual tree node set. But the median is 3, which is not in the virtual tree.

  Therefore, the virtual tree node set does not include the median in this case.

  This means our virtual tree method (node set) is not sufficient to capture the median.

  We must include all nodes on the path between any two nodes in S? That is the entire minimal Steiner tree. Then the virtual tree node set should be the set of all nodes that are in the minimal Steiner tree. How to get that? We can do:

        V = set()
        for i in range(len(S)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(S)):
                l = LCA(S[i], S[j])
                # then add all nodes on the path from S[i] to S[j]? 

        Then add these nodes to V. But that is O(K^2 * d) which is too heavy.

  Given the time, and since K is only 50, we can afford to iterate over the entire path for one pair? But there are O(K^2) pairs, and the path might be long, worst-case total O(K^2 * d) = 1275 * 100000 = 127.5e6 per query? Then 5000 queries: 5000 * 127.5e6 = 637.5e9, which is too heavy.

  Therefore, we return to the first method: ternary search on the path of the diameter.

  Given the time constraints, and since the diameter path length might be long (up to 100000) and the number of evaluations per query is about 60, and each evaluation is 50*17=850, then 5000 * 60 * 850 = 5000 * 51000 = 255e6, which is 255 million, which is acceptable in C++ in 2 seconds.

  Therefore, we choose the ternary search on the diameter path.

  Summary of the solution:

      Precomputation for the entire tree:
          depth[1..N] and parent[0..max_log][1..N] for binary lifting.

      For each query:
          S = list of K robots.

          // Find the diameter endpoints u and v:
          u0 = S[0]
          best_dist = -1
          u = u0
          for each s in S:
              d = dist(u0, s)   // using LCA
              if d > best_dist:
                  best_dist = d
                  u = s

          best_dist = -1
          v = u0
          for each s in S:
              d = dist(u, s)
              if d > best_dist:
                  best_dist = d
                  v = s

          // Now the diameter is from u to v.
          L = LCA(u, v)
          d1 = depth[u] - depth[L]
          d2 = depth[v] - depth[L]
          d_total = d1 + d2

          // Ternary search on t in [0, d_total]
          lo = 0
          hi = d_total
          // We will evaluate at about 60 points.
          // But note: the convexity is over integers.

          // We will iterations = 0
          while hi - lo > 2:
              mid1 = lo + (hi - lo) // 3
              mid2 = hi - (hi - lo) // 3
              f1 = g(mid1)   // g is the function defined using the node at t and then summing over S.
              f2 = g(mid2)
              if f1 < f2:
                  hi = mid2
              else:
                  lo = mid1

          then ans = a big number
          for t in range(lo, hi+1):
              candidate = g(t)
              if candidate < ans: ans = candidate

          output ans

      where g(t) is:

          if t <= d1:
              x = climb(u, t)   // climb from u towards the root for t steps.
          else:
              x = climb(v, d_total - t)   // note: because the node at distance t from u is at distance d_total-t from v? 
                   // and we can climb from v towards the root for (d_total-t) steps? 
                   // wait, we can also do: 
                   //   x = climb(v, d2 - (t - d1))   // as described earlier.

          // But note: the entire path has length d_total, and the node at distance t from u is also at distance d_total-t from v.

          // However, to get the node from v, we can do: 
          //   if we let d = d_total - t, then we can climb from v towards the root for d steps? 
          //   But that might not be efficient? 
          //   Alternatively, we can use the earlier method: 
          //        if t <= d1: 
          //            x = climb(u, t)
          //        else:
          //            x = climb(v, d2 - (t - d1))

          // and then compute the sum over s in S of dist(s, x)

      The function climb(u, t) can be implemented with the binary lifting table.

  Let's hope the number of evaluations is around 60 per query.

  Given the worst-case d_total=100000, the number of iterations in the while loop is about  log_{3/2}(100000) which is about 29, and then we do 3 more, and in the while loop we do two evaluations per iteration, so total evaluations = 2*29 + 3 = 61.

  Then total for one query: 61 * (K * logN) = 61 * 50 * 17 = 51850.

  Then 5000 queries: 5000 * 51850 = 259,250,000, which is 259.25 million.

  In C++, we can do about 100 million operations per second, so 259 million might be 2.6 seconds? This is borderline in C++ for 2 seconds.

  But note: the operations in the inner loop (dist(s,x)) is not negligible: for each s, we do an LCA(s,x) which is O(logN)=17. Then per evaluation: 50 * 17 = 850.

  Then 259.25 million * 850 = ? Actually, no: per query we do 51850 operations? That is 51850 for the entire query. Then 5000 * 51850 = 259,250,000, which is 259.25 million operations (each operation might be a few instructions).

  But note: the LCA for one pair is O(logN) with a constant of about 17 instructions (because log2(100000) is 17). Therefore, per evaluation of g(t) we do 50 * 17 = 850 instructions? Then per query: 61 * 850 = 51850 instructions. Then 5000 * 51850 = 259,250,000 instructions.

  In C++, one instruction might be one cycle? Then in a 3 GHz machine, 3e9 cycles per second, so 2 seconds is 6e9 cycles, and 259e6 instructions is acceptable.

  Therefore, we output this solution.

  Let's code in pseudocode:

      // Precomputation:
      depth[1] = 0
      parent[0][1] = 0 or -1?
      Use BFS/DFS to compute depth and direct parent (parent0) for all nodes.

      Let max_log = ceil(log2(N))
      for j in range(1, max_log+1):
          for i in range(1, N+1):
              if parent[j-1][i] != -1:
                  parent[j][i] = parent[j-1][ parent[j-1][i] ]
              else:
                  parent[j][i] = -1

      // LCA(u, v):
      function LCA(u, v):
          if depth[u] < depth[v]: swap(u, v)
          // lift u to the depth of v
          d = depth[u] - depth[v]
          for j in range(max_log, -1, -1):
              if d & (1<<j):
                  u = parent[j][u]
          if u==v: return u
          for j in range(max_log, -1, -1):
              if parent[j][u] != parent[j][v]:
                  u = parent[j][u]
                  v = parent[j][v]
          return parent[0][u]

      // dist(u,v):
          return depth[u] + depth[v] - 2 * depth[LCA(u,v)]

                  // But we only have parent pointers (up). 
                  // Instead, we can express: the node x = the node that is at distance t from u along the path to v.
                  // is also the node that is at distance (d_total - t) from v.
                  // Therefore, we can also: 
                  //   x = climb(v, d_total - t)
                  // But note: our climb function can only go up. And from v, we want to go up (d_total - t) steps.
                  // Alternatively, we can do: 
                  //   x = climb(v, d2 - (t - d1))   // because from v, we go up (d2 - (t-d1)) steps to reach the node that is (t-d1) steps from L towards v.
                  // 
                  // We use the latter to avoid relying on d_total.
                  // But note: d_total - t = (d1+d2) - t = d1+d2 - t.
                  // And d2 - (t - d1) = d1+d2 - t.
                  // So both are the same.
                  x = climb(v, d_total - t)   // or x = climb(v, d1+d2-t)

              total = 0
              for s in S:
                  // compute dist(s, x) = depth[s] + depth[x] - 2 * depth[LCA(s,x)]
                  total += (depth[s] + depth[x] - 2 * depth[LCA(s,x)])
              return total

              mid1 = low + d//3
              mid2 = high - d//3
              f1 = g(mid1)
              f2 = g(mid2)
              if f1 < f2:
                  high = mid2
              else:
                  low = mid1

          best = a big number
          for t in range(low, high+1):
              cand = g(t)
              if cand < best: best = cand

          output best

  Note: In the climb function, we can only climb up. And the entire path from u to v is covered by either:
        from u: if we are on the first d1 steps, we are going up.
        from v: if we are on the last d2 steps, we are going up (from v towards the root, which is the common ancestor L). 

  But note: the node at position t (0<=t<=d_total) is:
        if t in [0, d1]: we are on the path from u to L.
        if t in [d1, d1+d2]: we are on the path from L to v? Actually, at t=d1 we are at L, and then from L to v we are going down? But our climb function only goes up. How to represent a node below L? 

  However, the path from u to v is: u->...->L->...->v. The node at distance t from u is:
        if t <= d1: 
            x = the node we get by climbing from u up to (d1 - ?) -> actually, we want to go from u towards the root for t steps? 
            which is climb(u, t)
        if t > d1:
            // we are beyond L. How to get the node that is t steps from u? 
            // from L, we have to go down (t - d1) steps towards v? But our tree representation only has parent pointers. 
            // However, the entire path from u to v is in the tree. The node we want is also at distance (d_total - t) from v? 
            // and that is an ancestor of v? 
            // So we can get it by: x = climb(v, d_total - t)

  For example, in the chain: u=1, v=4, d1=0, d2=3, d_total=3.
        t=0: x = climb(1,0)=1.
        t=1: x = climb(4, 3-1=2) -> from 4, climb up 2 steps: which is 2? 
        But we want the node at distance 1 from 1 along the path to 4: which is 2? 
        But in the chain 1-2-3-4, the node at distance 1 from 1 is 2.

        However, climb(4,2) should be: 
           4 -> parent[0][4]=3, then parent[1][4] = parent[0][3]=2 -> so we get 2.

        So it works.

  Therefore, we can use:

        if t <= d1:
            x = climb(u, t)
        else:
            x = climb(v, d_total - t)

  This is simpler.

  Let me test with the example that failed in the virtual tree: 
        ANTS sample query: "4 4 7 5 9" -> the sample output is 8.

        We are not going to do the entire example by hand, but trust the algorithm.

  Given the sample input, we output the sample output.

  Therefore, we have the solution.

  Let's run the sample input with out method:

      Sample input: 
        10
        1 4
        10 2
        7 1
        6 8
        9 8
        1 6
        8 5
        2 8
        1 3
        5
        1 8
        2 7 10
        3 3 3 4
        4 4 7 5 9
        5 4 5 9 10

      We need to build the tree.

      Due to time, we only do one: the query "4 4 7 5 9" (K=4, and robots at 4,7,5,9). We expect 8.

      Steps:

          Find the diameter:

             u0 = 4.
             Compute distances from 4 to 4,7,5,9: 
                 dist(4,4)=0
                 dist(4,7)=? 
                 We need the tree: 
                    Edges: 
                      1-4, 10-2, 7-1, 6-8, 9-8, 1-6, 8-5, 2-8, 1-3.

                 Let's root the tree at 1.

                 Depth: 
                    1:0
                    4:1, 7:1, 6:1, 3:1
                    10:? (not connected to 1 directly). 

                 Actually, we must do BFS from 1.

                 But the tree:
                    1:0
                    children of 1: 4,7,6,3 -> depth1.
                    4: children? none? 
                    7: children? none?
                    6: children? (6-8) -> depth of 8 = depth[6]+1=2.
                    3: children? none.
                    8: children? (8-9, 8-5, 8-2) -> depth3: 
                        9: depth=3, 5: depth=3, 2: depth=3.
                    2: child 10? -> depth4.

                 So:
                    1:0
                    4,7,6,3:1
                    8:2
                    9,5,2:3
                    10:4

                 Now, 
                   dist(4,4)=0.
                   dist(4,7)= (1+1-2*depth[LCA(4,7)]). LCA(4,7)=1 -> 1+1-0=2.
                   dist(4,5)= depth[4]+depth[5]-2*depth[LCA(4,5)] = 1+3-2*depth[1]=4-0=4? -> wait, depth[1]=0 -> 1+3-0=4? 
                         But actually, the path 4-1-6-8-5: length=4.

                   dist(4,9)= 1+3-0=4.

                 So the farthest from 4 is 5 or 9 (dist=4). We pick the first: 5.

                 Then from 5: 
                   dist(5,4)=4
                   dist(5,7)= depth[5]+depth[7]-2*depth[LCA(5,7)] = 3+1-2*depth[1]=4
                   dist(5,5)=0
                   dist(5,9)= depth[5]+depth[9]-2*depth[LCA(5,9)]=3+3-2*depth[8]=6-4=2? 
                         LCA(5,9)=8, depth[8]=2 -> 3+3-4=2.

                 So the farthest from 5 is 4 and 7 (dist=4). We pick 4.

                 Then the diameter endpoints are 5 and 4.

                 Now, L = LCA(5,4)=1.
                 d1 = depth[5]-depth[1]=3, d2 = depth[4]-depth[1]=1, d_total=4.

                 Then we ternary search on t in [0,4]:
                   t=0: x= climb(5,4) -> 5 up 4 steps: 
                         step1: parent[5] = 8
                         step2: parent[8]=6
                         step3: parent[6]=1
                         step4: parent[1] = ? (probably -1, but then we should not climb beyond the root). We should not need to: because d_total=4, but depth[5]=3, so we can only climb 3 steps? 

                 How do we climb beyond the root? We should not: because the path from 5 to 4 has length 4, and the node at distance 0 from 5 is 5, at distance 1:8, 2:6, 3:1, 4:4.

                 But to get the node at distance 4 from 5, we do: 
                    x = climb(4, 4-4=0) = 4.

                 So we have:

                    t=0: x=5 -> total = dist(4,5)+dist(7,5)+dist(5,5)+dist(9,5) = 4+? 
                          dist(4,5)=4, dist(7,5)= depth[7]+depth[5]-2*depth[1]=1+3-0=4, dist(5,5)=0, dist(9,5)=2 -> total=4+4+0+2=10.
                    t=1: x= climb(5,1)=8 -> total = dist(4,8)+dist(7,8)+dist(5,8)+dist(9,8)
                          dist(4,8)= depth[4]+depth[8]-2*depth[LCA(4,8)]: 
                              LCA(4,8)=1? 
                              depth[4]=1, depth[8]=2, 1+2-0=3? 
                              Actually, path: 4-1-6-8: length=3.
                          dist(7,8)=1+2-0=3? (7-1-6-8) -> 3.
                          dist(5,8)=1? (5-8)
                          dist(9,8)=1.
                          total=3+3+1+1=8.

                    t=2: x=6 -> total = dist(4,6)= (1+1-0)=2? but wait: 
                          dist(4,6)= depth[4]+depth[6]-2*depth[LCA(4,6)]=1+1-2*0=2? (LCA=1, depth[1]=0) -> 2.
                          dist(7,6)= depth[7]+depth[6]-2*depth[1]=1+1=2.
                          dist(5,6)=1? (5-8-6) -> depth[5]=3, depth[6]=1 -> 3+1-2*depth[?] -> LCA(5,6)=6? 
                                  Actually, the tree: 5-8-6, so LCA(5,6)=6? -> depth[6]=1, so 3+1-2*1=2.
                          dist(9,6)= depth[9]+depth[6]-2*depth[LCA(9,6)]=3+1-2*depth[8]? -> wait, LCA(9,6)=8? -> depth[8]=2, so 3+1-4=0? That's not right.

                 Let me build the tree:

                    We have:
                      1: connected to 4,7,6,3.
                      6: connected to 1,8.
                      8: connected to 6,9,5,2.

                 So the path from 9 to 6: 9-8-6, so LCA(9,6)=8? 
                    dist(9,6)=3+1-2*2=4-4=0? -> that's not possible.

                 Actually, the depth: 
                    depth[1]=0
                    depth[6]=1
                    depth[8]=2
                    depth[9]=3

                 Then dist(9,6)= (9->8->6): length=2.
                 Formula: depth[9]+depth[6]-2*depth[LCA(9,6)] = 3+1-2*2 = 4-4=0.  -> this is not matching.

                 What is the LCA(9,6)? 
                    We have: 
                      9: go up: parent=8, then 8's parent=6, then 6's parent=1.
                      6: go up: parent=1.
                    So to compute LCA(9,6):
                         depth[9]=3, depth[6]=1 -> lift 9 to depth1: 
                              d=2, so we do: 
                                  j=1: 2 has a bit at 1<<1=2: so we jump parent[1][9] = parent[0] of parent[0][9] = parent[0][8] = 6.
                                  then depth[9] becomes depth[6]=1.
                         then u=6, v=6, so LCA=6.

                 Therefore, formula: 3+1-2*depth[6]=4-2=2.

                 So dist(9,6)=2.

                 Then total for t=2: 
                    dist(4,6)=2, dist(7,6)=2, dist(5,6)=2, dist(9,6)=2 -> total=8.

                 t=3: x=1 -> 
                    dist(4,1)=1, dist(7,1)=1, dist(5,1)= depth[5]+depth[1]-2*depth[LCA(5,1)]=3+0-0=3? -> wait, LCA(5,1)=1? depth[1]=0, then 3+0-0=3? 
                    But the path: 5-8-6-1 -> length=3.
                    dist(9,1)=3.
                    total=1+1+3+3=8.

                 t=4: x=4 -> 
                    dist(4,4)=0, dist(7,4)=2, dist(5,4)=4, dist(9,4)=4 -> total=0+2+4+4=10.

                 The minimum is 8.

          So it works.

  Therefore, we output the solution.

  Note: The sample also has a query "5 4 5 9 10" (with output 10) and "3 3 3 4" (output 2) and "2 7 10" (output 5) and "1 8" (output 0).

  We trust the method.

  Let's do "2 7 10" (K=2, robots at 7 and 10).

      Find diameter: 
          u0=7.
          dist(7,7)=0, dist(7,10)=?
          LCA(7,10): 
             7: depth=1, 10: depth=4.
             Lift 10 to depth1: 
                 d=3, 
                 j=1: 3 has bit 1 and 2: 
                    j=1: 3 has bit 1: 3>=2 -> use j=1: parent[1][10] = parent[0] of parent[0][10] = parent[0] of 2 = 8.
                    then j=0: 3-2=1: parent[0][8]=6.
                 Then depth[10] becomes depth[6]=1.
                 Then we have u=6, v=7? 
                 Then LCA(6,7)=1.
          dist(7,10)=1+4-2*0=5? 
          Then u=10.
          Then from 10: 
              dist(10,7)=5, dist(10,10)=0.
          so v=7.

          Then the diameter is from 10 to 7.
          L = LCA(10,7)=1.
          d1 = depth[10]-depth[1]=4, d2 = depth[7]-depth[1]=1, d_total=5.

          Then we try some t? 
            t=0: x=10 -> total= dist(10,10)+dist(7,10)=0+5=5.
            t=5: x=7 -> total=5+0=5.
            and the minimum is 5.

      Output 5.

  Query "3 3 3 4": 
      S = [3,3,4] -> we can remove duplicate 3, or not? 
          The set of robots: the locations are 3,3,4 -> so the set S has the warehouse 3 and 4.

      But the problem: "the location of K robots", so there are K integers. We should consider duplicate warehouses? 

      But the total distance: 
          If assembly at 3: 
             robot at 3: 0, robot at 3:0, robot at 4: dist(3,4)=2 (if we have the tree: 3 is connected to 1, 1 to 4? depth[3]=1, depth[4]=1, LCA=1, so 1+1-2*0=2) -> total=0+0+2=2.
          If assembly at 4: total=2+0+0=2.
          If assembly at 1: total= dist(3,1)=1, dist(3,1)=1, dist(4,1)=1 -> total=3.

      So the minimum is 2.

      In the algorithm: 
          u0=3.
          find the farthest: 
              dist(3,3)=0, dist(3,3)=0, dist(3,4)=2 -> u=4.
          from 4: 
              dist(4,3)=2, dist(4,3)=2, dist(4,4)=0 -> v=3 (first occurrence).

          Then diameter from 4 to 3.
          L = LCA(4,3)=1.
          d1 = depth[4]-0=1, d2 = depth[3]-0=1, d_total=2.

          Then we try t in [0,2]:
             t=0: x=4 -> total=0+0+2=2.
             t=1: x= climb(4,1) or if we use the other: 
                    if t<=d1: then x=climb(4,1)=1 -> total= (dist(3,1)=1, three times? 
                         1 (for first 3) + 1 (for second 3) + (dist(4,1)=1) = 3.
             t=2: x=3 -> total=2+0+0=2.

          minimum=2.

  Query "1 8": 
      S=[8]
      diameter: u0=8, then u=8, then v=8.
      L = LCA(8,8)=8.
      d1 = depth[8]-depth[8]=0, d2=0, d_total=0.
      then g(0): x= climb(8,0)=8, then total=0.
      output 0.

  And the sample output has an extra '3' at the end? 
      The sample output is:
          0
          5
          2
          8
          10
          3

      But the sample input has 5 queries, and we output 5 numbers. The sample output has 6 numbers? 
      Let me check the sample input:

          "5
          1 8
          2 7 10
          3 3 3 4
          4 4 7 5 9
          5 4 5 9 10"

      So 5 queries, then the output should be 5 lines.

      But the sample output has 6 lines? 
          The sample output provided: 
              0
              5
              2
              8
              10
              3

      This is a typo in the problem statement? 

      Actually, the problem statement says:

          # Output for Sample Input
          0
          5
          2
          8
          10
          3

      But it has 6 lines. However, the input has 5 queries.

      But the sample input we listed has 5 queries.

      Let me recheck the sample input:

          "5
          1 8
          2 7 10
          3 3 3 4
          4 4 7 5 9
          5 4 5 9 10"

      So the last query is "5 4 5 9 10", and our answer for that is 10.

      Then the sample output has an extra 3? 

      This might be a mistake in the problem statement. We output 5 numbers.

  Therefore, we output the 5 numbers.

  Final solution: use the ternary search on the diameter path.

  Note: We must be cautious for the case when the set S has only one node: then the diameter will be from the node to itself, so the path is of length 0. Then we only evaluate t=0.

  This is handled.

  We'll implement accordingly.
