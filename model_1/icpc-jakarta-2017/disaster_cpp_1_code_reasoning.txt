 Okay, let's translate the Python solution to C++ with attention to performance and constraints.
 Steps:
 1. We read the input: the rectangle (x1, y1, x2, y2) and N, then N circles.
 2. We filter the circles: only keep those that intersect the rectangle. How?
      The rectangle is [x1, x2] x [y1, y2]. The circle (fx, fy, r) intersects the rectangle if the closest point in the rectangle to (fx, fy) is within distance r.

      How to compute the closest point?
        Let:
          cx = max(x1, min(fx, x2));
          cy = max(y1, min(fy, y2));
        Then the squared distance from (fx, fy) to (cx, cy) is: (fx - cx)^2 + (fy - cy)^2.
        If this squared distance < r^2, then the circle intersects the rectangle.

      However, note: the problem says the towers are safe and the circle might only touch the boundary? But the condition is "strictly inside", so touching is safe? Actually, the condition is: "the distance ... should be at least r_i". So if the distance is exactly r, the point is safe (on the boundary is not strictly inside). Therefore, the circle intersecting the rectangle (even if just touching) might not necessarily block the entire rectangle? But note: our graph construction considers if a circle covers a boundary (so if the distance to the boundary is less than the radius, then it covers some part of the boundary). However, for filtering, we want circles that actually have any point in the rectangle? Actually, if the circle does not touch the rectangle at all, we can ignore it. So the condition for keeping is: the circle must have at least one point in the rectangle? Actually, the problem says that a point is safe if it is not strictly inside any circle. Therefore, if a circle does not touch the rectangle at all, then it doesn't affect the safety of any point in the rectangle. So we can ignore it.

      Therefore, we keep a circle if the distance from (fx, fy) to the rectangle is <= r. But note: the distance to the rectangle is the distance from (fx, fy) to the closest point in the rectangle. However, if the circle center is inside the rectangle, then the closest point is the center itself? Actually, no: the closest point is the projection. Actually, we can compute the squared distance without sqrt for efficiency.

      Alternatively, we can compute the squared distance to the rectangle as:
        dx = 0;
        if (fx < x1) dx = x1 - fx;
        else if (fx > x2) dx = fx - x2;
        else dx = 0;

        dy = 0;
        if (fy < y1) dy = y1 - fy;
        else if (fy > y2) dy = fy - y2;
        else dy = 0;

        Then if (dx*dx + dy*dy < r*r) -> then the circle touches the rectangle? Actually, if the center is inside the rectangle, then dx=0 and dy=0 -> then 0 < r*r (which is true for r>=1). So we must keep all circles that have center inside the rectangle? Actually, even if the center is outside, we only need to check the distance to the closest point in the rectangle. The above dx and dy computation gives the vector from the center to the closest point? Actually, the squared distance to the closest point in the rectangle is dx*dx+dy*dy. So if that squared distance is <= r*r? Actually, if it's equal, then the circle touches the rectangle. We want to include circles that at least touch the rectangle? But note: if the circle does not touch the rectangle (distance>r) then we skip.

      However, note: if the circle is entirely outside and does not touch the rectangle, then we skip.

      But note: what if the circle does not contain the closest point? Actually, the condition is: the distance from the center to the rectangle is <= r. Then the circle and rectangle have at least one point in common? Actually, no: if the center is outside and the distance to the rectangle is d, then if d<=r, the circle covers the entire segment from the center to that closest point and beyond, so it must cover the closest point? Actually, the closest point is the point on the rectangle boundary that is nearest to the center. So if the distance d<=r, then the circle covers that point. Therefore, we keep the circle if d<=r? But note: we are only concerned about the interior? Actually, the condition for a point to be safe is that it is not strictly inside. Therefore, if the circle touches the rectangle at a point, that point is safe (because it is exactly at distance r). So the circle does not make that point unsafe. However, the circle might cover points inside the rectangle? Actually, if the circle center is outside and the distance to the closest point is d, and d < r, then there is a neighborhood inside the rectangle that is strictly inside the circle? Yes. Therefore, we must consider circles that have d < r? Or d <= r? Actually, we want to know if the circle covers any point strictly inside the rectangle? Actually, if d < r, then the circle covers a part of the rectangle (interior points). If d == r, then the circle only touches the rectangle at the boundary, and that boundary point is safe. But note: the circle might also cover points beyond the rectangle? We don't care. The key is: if the circle does not have any point strictly inside the rectangle? Actually, when d==r, the circle touches the boundary of the rectangle. The points strictly inside the rectangle are at distance > d? Actually, no: the closest point is at distance d, and any point inside the rectangle that is not the closest point is farther? Actually, no: the circle center is outside, and the closest point is on the boundary. The interior points of the rectangle near that boundary point are at distance less than r? Actually, no: because the circle center is outside, the interior points are farther away from the center than the boundary point? Actually, no: if the circle center is outside and the rectangle is convex, then the closest point is the boundary. The interior points are actually farther? Actually, no: consider the circle center to the left of the rectangle. The closest point is (x1, y) for some y. Then an interior point (x1+eps, y) is at distance (fx - (x1+eps)) = (distance to the boundary) + eps? Actually, if the center is at (x1 - d, y) then the distance to (x1, y) is d, and the distance to (x1+eps, y) is d+eps. So indeed, the interior points are farther. Therefore, the circle does not cover any interior point? Then we can skip circles that are exactly tangent? However, note: the circle might cover interior points if the center is not aligned with the boundary? For example, if the center is at (x1 - a, y1 - b) then the closest point is (x1, y1). The distance from the center to (x1, y1) is sqrt(a^2+b^2). Now consider a point (x1+delta, y1+delta) inside the rectangle. The distance from the center to that point is sqrt((a+delta)^2 + (b+delta)^2) which is greater than sqrt(a^2+b^2). So again, the interior points are farther. Therefore, if the distance from the center to the rectangle is exactly r, then the circle does not cover any point strictly inside the rectangle? So we can skip such circles.

      Therefore, we only keep circles that have: dx*dx+dy*dy < r*r (so strictly less). Because if it's equal, then the circle only touches the boundary and does not cover any interior point of the rectangle? But note: what if the circle center is inside the rectangle? Then dx=0 and dy=0, so d=0. Then 0 < r*r -> true for any r>=1. So we keep it. But if the circle is entirely outside and d>=r, we skip.

      However, note: the problem states that the towers are safe. The towers are at (x1,y1) and (x2,y2). So we must ensure that these points are not strictly inside any circle. But we are filtering circles that do not cover any interior point? Actually, the condition for the tower: if a circle has center (fx, fy) and radius r, then the distance from the tower to the center must be >= r. Since the towers are safe, we know this holds. But what if a circle has the tower exactly on the boundary? Then the tower is safe. But if the circle covers the entire tower? Actually, the condition is that the tower is safe by the problem. Therefore, we don't have to worry: the input guarantees the towers are safe.

      So we filter: keep circle i if the squared distance (dx*dx+dy*dy) < r*r? Actually, no: we want the circle to cover at least one point strictly inside the rectangle? Actually, we want to know if the circle covers any point strictly inside the rectangle? Then the condition is: the distance from the circle center to the rectangle must be < r (because if the distance is d, then the circle covers the entire ball of radius r, so if d < r, then the circle covers the closest point and beyond, including some interior? Actually, if d < r, then the circle covers the entire disk of radius r, which must include points strictly inside the rectangle? But note: the closest point might be on the boundary, and if d < r, then there are points in the rectangle that are at distance less than r? Actually, the circle center is outside: the closest point is on the boundary. Then the circle extends beyond the boundary by r-d. But the interior points near the boundary are at distances from d to d+? So if r-d is positive, then the circle extends into the rectangle? Actually, the circle will cover a portion of the rectangle. Therefore, we keep circles that have d < r.

      However, what if the circle center is inside the rectangle? Then d=0, and 0<r -> we keep. So condition: if (dx*dx+dy*dy) < r*r, then the circle covers at least one point strictly inside the rectangle? Actually, if the center is inside, then the center is strictly inside the circle? But the center is a point. Actually, the circle covers the entire neighborhood of the center? But note: the center is at distance 0 from itself, and 0 < r, so the center is strictly inside the circle? Then we must avoid that circle. So we keep circles that have d < r. This condition is correct: we only care about circles that have at least one point in the rectangle that is strictly inside the circle? Actually, no: we care about circles that cover any part of the rectangle? Actually, we are building a graph of circles that form barriers. If a circle only touches the boundary (d==r) then it doesn't cover any interior point? So it doesn't form a barrier? Actually, it doesn't block any path? Because the path can go around the boundary? But note: the boundary is safe. So we can ignore circles that are tangent? Therefore, we only consider circles that actually have an interior point of the rectangle covered? Actually, the problem says the safe points are those that are not strictly inside any circle. So the entire rectangle is safe if we ignore circles that don't cover any interior point? Therefore, we can ignore circles with d>=r.

      So our filtering: 
        if (dx*dx+dy*dy) < r*r: then the circle has at least one point strictly inside the rectangle? Actually, no: the closest point is at distance d, and if d<r, then the circle covers the closest point? But the closest point is on the boundary? And then the circle extends beyond the boundary? Actually, the circle covers a neighborhood of the closest point that is inside the rectangle? How? Consider: the circle center is outside, and the closest point is on the boundary. Then the circle extends from the center to the closest point and beyond? But beyond the boundary? Actually, the circle extends into the rectangle? The segment from the center to the closest point is perpendicular to the boundary? Then the circle will cover a semicircle? Actually, the circle will cover a region that is inside the rectangle? Specifically, the circle covers the closest point and then extends into the rectangle by (r - d) in the direction perpendicular to the boundary? So yes, it covers interior points.

      Therefore, condition: we keep the circle if the squared distance (dx*dx+dy*dy) < r*r.

 3. After filtering, we have a list of relevant circles.

 4. We build a graph with:
        Nodes: the indices of the kept circles (0 to n_keep-1) and 4 extra nodes for boundaries: left, right, bottom, top.

        How to assign boundaries? 
          left: the segment (x1, y1) to (x1, y2)   (vertical at x=x1, from y1 to y2)
          right: (x2, y1) to (x2, y2)
          bottom: (x1, y1) to (x2, y1)
          top: (x1, y2) to (x2, y2)

        For each circle i (from 0 to n_keep-1) and each boundary, we check if the circle covers that boundary? How?
          We define: the circle covers a boundary if there exists a point on the boundary that is strictly inside the circle? Actually, if the distance from the circle center to the boundary segment is less than the radius, then the circle covers at least one point on the boundary? But note: the boundary is a segment. We have a function to compute the distance from a point to a segment.

        Actually, we can compute the distance from the circle center to the segment. If that distance is less than the radius, then the circle covers at least one point of the segment? Actually, if the distance is less than the radius, then the circle covers the entire segment? Actually, no: if the distance is d, then the circle covers the closest point on the segment? And then the circle extends beyond? Actually, the circle covers a neighborhood of the closest point? So if d < r, then the circle covers the entire segment? Actually, no: it covers a disk of radius r around the center, which includes the entire segment only if the segment is entirely within the circle? But we don't need the entire segment, we only care if at least one point of the segment is strictly inside the circle? Actually, if the distance from the center to the segment is d, then the closest point on the segment is at distance d. Then if d < r, then the closest point is strictly inside the circle? Then we have at least one point (the closest point) that is strictly inside? So we consider that the circle blocks that boundary? Actually, no: we are building a barrier. The circle is connected to the boundary if it covers any part of the boundary? Actually, we are building a graph to represent connectivity: if a circle is connected to the left boundary and also to the right boundary, then we have a chain of circles that blocks the entire rectangle from left to right? Similarly for top and bottom.

        Therefore, for a circle and a boundary segment, we connect if the distance from the circle center to the segment is less than the radius? Actually, less than the radius? Then the circle covers at least one point of the segment (strictly inside? Actually, the closest point is at distance d, then if d < r, the circle covers the closest point? And the closest point is on the segment? So we connect.

        How to compute distance from a point (x,y) to a segment (x1,y1,x2,y2)? We have a helper function.

        Note: the segments are either horizontal or vertical? Because the rectangle is axis-aligned. So we can simplify:

          For left boundary: segment (x1, y1) to (x1, y2). This is vertical. The distance from (fx, fy) to this segment:
            If fy is between y1 and y2, then the distance is |fx - x1|.
            If fy < y1, then the distance is the distance to (x1, y1).
            If fy > y2, then the distance is the distance to (x1, y2).

          Similarly for the other boundaries.

        We can write a helper function for a vertical segment and a horizontal segment? Actually, we know the boundaries:

          left: vertical at x=x1, from y=y1 to y=y2.
          right: vertical at x=x2, from y=y1 to y=y2.
          bottom: horizontal at y=y1, from x=x1 to x=x2.
          top: horizontal at y=y2, from x=x1 to x=x2.

        So we can compute:

          d_left = 
            if (fy >= y1 && fy <= y2) -> abs(fx - x1)
            else if (fy < y1) -> sqrt((fx - x1)*(fx - x1) + (fy - y1)*(fy - y1))
            else -> sqrt((fx - x1)*(fx - x1) + (fy - y2)*(fy - y2))

          But note: we want to avoid sqrt if possible? We can compare squared distances? Actually, we are comparing d < r. But if we square both sides, we have to be cautious: if d and r are nonnegative, then d < r <=> d^2 < r^2? Actually, yes.

        However, note: the distance d is computed as:

          For left: 
            if fy in [y1, y2]: d = |fx - x1|
            else if fy < y1: d = sqrt((fx-x1)^2 + (fy-y1)^2)
            else: d = sqrt((fx-x1)^2 + (fy-y2)^2)

        So we can compute the squared distance and then compare with r^2? Actually, we can avoid sqrt by computing squared distance and then comparing with r^2? But note: the condition is d < r -> d^2 < r^2? This is true only when d and r are nonnegative, which they are.

        Therefore, we can do:

          For left boundary:
            if (fy <= y2 && fy >= y1) {
                d_sq = (fx - x1) * (fx - x1);
            } else if (fy < y1) {
                d_sq = (fx - x1)*(fx - x1) + (fy - y1)*(fy - y1);
            } else { // fy > y2
                d_sq = (fx - x1)*(fx - x1) + (fy - y2)*(fy - y2);
            }

          Then if d_sq < r*r: then connect circle i to the left boundary.

        Similarly for the other boundaries.

 5. Then, for each pair of circles (i, j): 
        Let (fx_i, fy_i, r_i) and (fx_j, fy_j, r_j). 
        If the distance between centers <= r_i + r_j, then we add an edge between node i and node j.

        We can avoid sqrt: compute squared distance between centers: d_sq = (fx_i - fx_j)^2 + (fy_i - fy_j)^2.
        Then if d_sq <= (r_i + r_j)^2 -> then they overlap? Actually, we want if the circles overlap? The condition for two circles to have at least one common point is d <= r_i+r_j. But we are building connectivity: if they overlap, then they form a barrier together. So we add an edge.

        But note: if the circles just touch (d == r_i+r_j), then they are connected? Yes.

        However, we are building a graph for barriers: if two circles touch, they form a continuous barrier? Actually, the barrier might be broken? But note: the safe path must avoid the interior of the circles. If two circles touch, then the path cannot go through the touching point? Actually, the touching point is on the boundary of both circles, so it is safe? But the problem: a point is safe if it is not strictly inside any circle. The touching point is on the boundary? Then it is safe. Therefore, the path can go through the touching point? But then the barrier is broken? Actually, the barrier is not continuous? 

        However, note: our graph is for connectivity of the obstacles: if two circles touch, then they are connected as obstacles? And then if we have a chain of circles from left to right, then they form a barrier that the path cannot cross? Actually, the path can go through the boundary? But the problem says: we require that the entire path is safe. So if the barrier is continuous (with circles overlapping or touching) then the path cannot cross? Actually, the path can go through the boundary points? But the boundary points are safe? So if the circles only touch, then the path can go through the touching point? Therefore, we should not consider two circles that only touch as connected? Actually, the problem says: "a point is safe if it is at least the radius away" -> so the boundary is safe. Therefore, the circles that touch do not form a barrier? Then we should require that the circles overlap (strictly) to form a barrier? Actually, if we don't connect circles that only touch, then the barrier might be broken. But the problem says: the two circles are connected by a safe path if they are connected by a chain of overlapping circles? Actually, the problem is: we are building a graph to represent that the circles are adjacent in the barrier. If two circles only touch, then there is no gap? Actually, the gap is exactly the touching point? And the path can go through the touching point? So the barrier is broken? Therefore, we should only connect circles that have an overlap (strictly) -> d < r_i + r_j? 

        However, note: the problem statement: the circles are burning areas. The condition for a point to be safe is: distance at least r_i. So if two circles touch at a point, that point is at distance r_i from the first center and r_j from the second center? Then it is safe? Therefore, the path can go through that point? So the barrier is broken? Therefore, we should not connect circles that only touch? We want to connect circles that have overlapping burning areas? Actually, the burning area of two circles that touch do not form a connected set? The interior of the two circles are disjoint? Actually, the interiors are disjoint. So the barrier is not continuous? Then we should not add an edge for touching circles.

        But wait: the problem says: the path must be safe. So if two circles touch, then there is a safe point between them? And the path can go through that point? Therefore, they do not form a barrier? 

        Therefore, we only connect circles that have d < r_i + r_j? Actually, the condition in the Python solution was: 
            if d <= r1 + r2: then connect.

        Why? The problem says: the two circles are connected by an edge if they overlap? Actually, the Python solution uses d<=r1+r2. But then the circles that only touch are connected. How is that justified?

        The idea in the barrier: if two circles touch, then they form a continuous barrier? Actually, the union of the two closed disks is connected? But the path can go through the boundary? Actually, the boundary is safe? So the barrier is broken? 

        However, the problem of connectivity of the barriers: we are building a graph such that if there is a chain of circles that are connected (by overlapping or touching) from the left boundary to the right boundary, then the entire chain blocks the entire rectangle? Actually, if the chain is connected (even by touching), then the union of the circles is a connected set that spans from left to right? Then the rectangle is divided? Actually, the path cannot go from one side to the other without going through one of the circles? But the path can go through the boundaries? 

        Actually, the barrier is the union of the circles. The safe region is the rectangle minus the interiors of the circles. The barrier (the union of the circles) might disconnect the rectangle? How? 

        The key insight: the two towers are at (x1,y1) and (x2,y2). The barrier that prevents communication is a chain of circles that either:
            - connects the left and right boundaries, and also goes from top to bottom? Actually, no: if it connects left and right, then it separates the top and bottom? Actually, the rectangle is divided vertically? Similarly, if the chain connects bottom and top, then it separates the left and right? 

        Therefore, if there is a connected component of circles that touches the left boundary and the right boundary, then the entire rectangle is separated vertically? Similarly for bottom and top.

        But note: the path might go above or below the barrier? Actually, if the barrier is connected from left to right, then it must cross the entire rectangle? Similarly, if connected from bottom to top, it must cross the entire rectangle? Therefore, the towers (at opposite corners) would be separated.

        However, the circles are arbitrary? They might not form a continuous barrier? But if they are connected (by overlapping or touching) and together they connect the left boundary to the right boundary, then the barrier is continuous? Actually, the union of the circles is a connected set that touches the left and right boundaries? Then any path from the bottom-left to the top-right must cross the barrier? But the barrier consists of the interiors of the circles? Actually, the path is safe and must avoid the interiors? So it cannot cross the barrier? Therefore, the path does not exist.

        So the condition: if there is a path in the graph from the left boundary to the right boundary, then the two towers (which are at the bottom-left and top-right) are separated? Actually, the towers are at (x1,y1) and (x2,y2). The tower at (x1,y1) is the bottom-left? Actually, the problem says: x1 < x2 and y1 < y2. So (x1,y1) is the bottom-left? and (x2,y2) is the top-right.

        How does a barrier from left to right block? It would block the entire rectangle from left to right, so the bottom and top become disconnected? Actually, the barrier might not necessarily be horizontal? It could be diagonal? But the point is: if there is a chain of circles that together connect the left boundary to the right boundary, then the entire rectangle is divided into two parts: above and below the chain? Similarly, if we have a chain from bottom to top, then the rectangle is divided into left and right? Actually, the chain from bottom to top would block horizontally.

        Therefore, we must check both:
          - If there is a path from the left boundary to the right boundary (then the entire rectangle is divided vertically, so the top and bottom are disconnected? Actually, the towers are at bottom-left and top-right. So if there is a barrier from left to right that is above the bottom-left tower? Then the barrier might block the path to the top? Actually, the barrier might be anywhere? We require that the barrier blocks the entire rectangle? Actually, the barrier only needs to connect the left and right boundaries? Then it necessarily blocks the entire rectangle? Because the boundaries are continuous? Similarly, a barrier from bottom to top blocks the entire rectangle?

        Therefore, the algorithm:

          Build graph:
            Nodes: [0, n_keep-1] for kept circles, and then 4 boundary nodes: left (index = n_keep), right (n_keep+1), bottom (n_keep+2), top (n_keep+3).

          For each circle i:
            Check if it covers the left boundary: if the distance from center to the left segment < r -> then connect circle i to left.
            Similarly for right, bottom, top.

          For each pair (i, j) of circles: if the distance between centers <= r_i+r_j (and note: strictly less? or <=) -> we use <=. Why? Because if they touch, then the union is connected? Then the barrier is continuous? Actually, the union of the two closed disks is connected? Then we consider them connected? So we use <=.

          Then, we do two BFS:

            First: from left boundary to right boundary? If we can go from left to right, then output "NO" (because the rectangle is blocked vertically, so the bottom-left and top-right are separated? Actually, no: the barrier might be above the top-right? Actually, the barrier must block the entire rectangle? Actually, the barrier from left to right doesn't necessarily block the entire rectangle? How? 

          Actually, the problem: the towers are at (x1,y1) and (x2,y2). The barrier from left to right would block any path that tries to go from the bottom to the top? Actually, if the barrier is at a certain height, it blocks everything above it? Actually, no: the path can go around? 

          But note: the barrier is connected from the left boundary to the right boundary? Then any path that goes from the bottom to the top must cross the barrier? Actually, yes: by the Jordan curve theorem? So the rectangle is divided into two regions: one above the barrier and one below? Therefore, if the bottom-left tower is below the barrier and the top-right tower is above the barrier, then they are separated? Actually, the barrier might be anywhere? But note: the barrier is a connected set that touches the left and right boundaries? Then it must cross the entire rectangle? So the rectangle is divided into two connected components: one above and one below? Actually, the barrier is arbitrary? It might not be a simple curve? But the union of the circles is connected? Then the entire barrier is connected? And it touches the left and right boundaries? Then the barrier must separate the rectangle into at least two connected components? So the two towers are in the same component only if they are both above the barrier or both below? But we don't know? Actually, the towers are at the corners: the bottom-left and top-right. They are in opposite corners? So if the barrier is above the bottom-left tower and below the top-right tower? Then the bottom-left tower is below the barrier and the top-right tower is above the barrier? Then they are separated.

          Therefore, if there is a barrier from left to right, the two towers are separated? Similarly, if there is a barrier from bottom to top, the two towers are separated? Actually, no: a barrier from bottom to top would separate the rectangle into left and right? Then the bottom-left tower is to the left of the barrier? and the top-right tower is to the right? Then they are separated? 

          Actually, both barriers would separate the two towers? Therefore, we must check for either barrier? 

          However, note: the problem says the towers are at (x1,y1) and (x2,y2). The rectangle is [x1,x2]x[y1,y2]. The two towers are at opposite corners. Then:

            - A barrier from left to right: if it exists, then the entire rectangle is divided into two parts: one below the barrier and one above. The bottom-left tower (x1,y1) is at the bottom-left. The top-right tower (x2,y2) is at the top-right. So if the barrier is at a height between y1 and y2, then the bottom-left tower is below and the top-right is above -> separated.

            - A barrier from bottom to top: if it exists, then the entire rectangle is divided into two parts: one left of the barrier and one right. Then the bottom-left tower is left and the top-right is right -> separated.

          Therefore, if either barrier exists, then the two towers are separated? Then output "NO". Otherwise, output "YES".

        But note: what if both barriers exist? Then we still output "NO".

        However, what if the barrier from left to right is at the very top? Then the bottom-left tower is below the barrier? But the top-right tower is above the barrier? Actually, the barrier is at the top? Then the top-right tower is above the barrier? But the barrier is at the top of the rectangle? The top boundary is at y2. The top-right tower is at (x2,y2). The barrier from left to right at the top: then the circle that touches the top boundary? Then the barrier is at y2? Then the top-right tower is at the top boundary? But the top boundary is safe? So the tower is safe? And the barrier is above the tower? Actually, the tower is at the top boundary? Then the barrier might be above the tower? Actually, the barrier is at the top boundary? Then the tower is at the barrier? Then the barrier does not block the path? Actually, the barrier is at the top boundary, so the entire rectangle below the barrier is connected? And the tower is at the barrier? Then the path can go along the boundary? 

        How do we handle that? 

        The key: we are building the graph for barriers. We connect a circle to the top boundary if the circle covers the top boundary? But if the circle only touches the top boundary at (x, y2) for some x, then the point (x, y2) is safe? Therefore, the circle does not block the top boundary? Actually, the top boundary is safe? So the path can go along the top boundary? Therefore, the barrier that ends at the top boundary does not necessarily block the entire rectangle? 

        Actually, the barrier must block the entire rectangle? We require that the barrier is a chain that connects the left and right boundaries? Then even if it is at the top, it still connects left and right? Then the entire rectangle is divided? The part above the barrier? But the barrier is at the top? Then there is nothing above? Actually, the barrier is at the top boundary? Then the entire rectangle is below the barrier? And the barrier is at the top? Then the barrier does not block any path that goes below? Actually, the barrier is at the top, so the path can go from the bottom-left to the top-right without crossing the barrier? It goes below the barrier? 

        Therefore, the barrier from left to right at the top does not block the entire rectangle? Similarly, a barrier at the bottom does not block? 

        Actually, the barrier must extend from the left boundary to the right boundary at some height in the middle? Then it blocks? 

        How do we model this? 

        The insight: we consider the entire barrier that connects the left boundary to the right boundary. The barrier might be wavy? But if it connects left to right, then the entire rectangle is divided? Actually, by the Jordan curve theorem, any connected set that touches the left and right boundaries must separate the rectangle into two components? But note: the barrier might be at the top? Then the entire rectangle is one connected component? Actually, the barrier is attached to the top? Then the rectangle minus the barrier is still connected? 

        Actually, the barrier is the union of the circles? And the circles are closed sets? Then the complement in the rectangle is open? And if the barrier is attached to the top, then the complement is connected? 

        Therefore, the barrier only blocks the entire rectangle if it is a "wall" that goes from left to right without touching the top or bottom? Actually, no: if the barrier is attached to the top, then it doesn't block the bottom? 

        So the condition: the barrier must be a connected set that touches the left and right boundaries and does not touch the top and bottom? Actually, no: it can touch the top? but then the path can go below? 

        Actually, the problem is solved by:

          If there is a chain of circles that together connect the left and right boundaries (regardless of height) then the entire rectangle is divided? Actually, no: if the chain is at the top, then the entire rectangle below is connected? So the bottom-left and top-right are still connected? Because the top-right is at the top? and the barrier is at the top? Then the path can go from the bottom-left to the top-right without going above the barrier? Actually, the barrier is at the top, so the path can go along the top boundary? 

        Therefore, we must require that the barrier does not leave any gap at the top or bottom? Actually, the barrier from left to right must be a "wall" that the path cannot avoid? That is, the barrier must be such that any path from the bottom-left to the top-right must cross the barrier? Then the barrier must separate the two towers? 

        How to ensure that? 

        Actually, the barrier that connects the left and right boundaries must necessarily block the entire rectangle? Only if the barrier is not attached to the top or bottom? Actually, if the barrier is attached to the top, then the path can go below? 

        Alternatively, we can think: the barrier that connects the left and right boundaries and also the barrier that connects the bottom and top boundaries? Actually, the problem is symmetric? 

        The known solution in competitive programming for this problem is:

          Build a graph with circles and boundaries (left, right, bottom, top). Then:

            if there is a path in the graph from left to right OR from bottom to top, then output "NO", else "YES".

        This is what the Python solution does.

        Why? 

          - A path from left to right: the circles form a barrier that touches the left and right boundaries? Then the barrier divides the rectangle into two parts: above and below? The two towers are at the bottom-left and top-right? Then they are separated? 

          - Similarly, a path from bottom to top: the barrier divides the rectangle into left and right? Then the two towers are separated.

        But what if the barrier from left to right is at the top? Then the barrier does not block the entire rectangle? Actually, the barrier is at the top? Then the bottom-left tower is below? and the top-right tower is above? Actually, the top-right tower is at the top boundary? Then the barrier might be above the top-right tower? But the barrier is attached to the top boundary? Then the top-right tower is at the barrier? And the barrier is above the bottom-left tower? Then the barrier blocks the path from the bottom-left to the top-right? Actually, the path can go to the top-right without going through the barrier? Because the barrier is at the top? and the top-right tower is at the top? and the barrier is along the top? Then the path can go along the bottom and then up the right side? 

        Actually, the barrier is a chain of circles that connects the left boundary to the right boundary? And it is at the top? Then the entire top boundary is blocked? But the top boundary is safe? Actually, the barrier circles only cover the top boundary at discrete points? Then the path can go along the top boundary between the circles? 

        Therefore, the barrier must cover the entire boundary? Actually, no: it only needs to connect the left and right boundaries? Then the barrier might be a single circle that covers the entire top? Then the entire top boundary is covered? 

        But note: the condition for a circle to cover the top boundary: we check if the distance from the circle center to the top boundary is less than the radius? Then the circle covers at least one point of the top boundary? It might not cover the entire top boundary? 

        How can we ensure that the barrier blocks the entire rectangle? Actually, the barrier is the union of the circles? And if the circles form a connected set that touches the left and right boundaries, then the barrier is a connected set that spans from left to right? Then the rectangle is divided? 

        This is a known technique: the problem "Ice Cave" or similar. 

        Actually, the known solution for this exact problem (from ICPC Jakarta 2017) uses the following:

          Build graph of circles (only those that block the rectangle, i.e., cover an interior point) and boundaries.

          Connect a circle to a boundary if the circle covers any part of that boundary.

          Connect two circles if they overlap (d <= r_i + r_j).

          Then, if there is a path from left to right OR from bottom to top in this graph, the answer is "NO", else "YES".

        Therefore, we follow that.

 6. Implementation:

        We have n_keep circles.

        We build a graph with n_keep+4 nodes? Actually, we only need n_keep+4 nodes? The boundaries are 4 nodes.

        Then we run BFS twice? Actually, we run two separate BFS: one from left to right, and if we find a path we output "NO". Then if we don't, we run BFS from bottom to top? and if we find a path we output "NO". Otherwise, "YES".

 7. Edge Cases:

        N=0: then we have no circles. Then the entire rectangle is safe? Then we output "YES".

        The towers are safe by the problem, so we don't have to worry about circles covering the towers? Actually, we filtered circles that do not cover any interior point? And the towers are safe? So any circle that might cover the tower would be filtered? Actually, if a circle covers the tower, then the distance from the circle center to the tower is >= r? Actually, the problem guarantees the towers are safe. So we know that the towers are not strictly inside any circle? Therefore, for the tower (x1,y1): 
            For a circle (fx, fy, r): (fx - x1)^2 + (fy - y1)^2 >= r^2.

        But note: our filtering condition: we kept a circle if the squared distance from the center to the rectangle < r^2. The tower (x1,y1) is in the rectangle? So if the circle covers the tower, then the distance from the center to the tower is < r? But the problem says the tower is safe -> the distance is >= r. So the circle that covers the tower would not be kept? Actually, the distance from the circle center to the rectangle (for the tower) is 0? Then 0 < r^2 -> we would keep the circle? But wait, the problem says the tower is safe -> the distance to the circle center must be >= r. Then 0>=r -> only possible if r=0? But r>=1. Contradiction? Therefore, the circle that covers the tower would have the distance from the center to the tower (which is in the rectangle) being less than r? But the problem guarantees the tower is safe -> so the circle cannot cover the tower? 

        Therefore, the circle that covers the tower is not possible? So we are safe.

        However, what if the circle touches the tower? Then the distance from the center to the tower is r? Then the squared distance to the rectangle (which includes the tower) is 0? Then 0 < r^2 -> we keep the circle? But the circle does not cover the tower? It only touches? Then the tower is safe? So it's okay.

        Actually, the condition for the tower: the distance must be at least r. So if it is r, then the tower is safe. But our filtering condition: we keep the circle if the squared distance (to the closest point in the rectangle) < r^2. The closest point to the circle center in the rectangle might be the tower? Then the squared distance is (r)^2? Then we do not keep the circle? Because we require < r^2? 

        Therefore, for a circle that only touches the tower: the squared distance from the center to the rectangle is r^2? Then we do not keep? That is correct: the circle does not cover any interior point? So we skip.

        Therefore, the filtering condition is: keep circle if the squared distance to the rectangle is < r^2.

 8. Let's code accordingly.

        Steps:

          Read x1, y1, x2, y2, N.
          Read circles.

          kept_circles = []
          for each circle (fx, fy, r):
            dx = 0;
            if (fx < x1) dx = x1 - fx;
            else if (fx > x2) dx = fx - x2;
            else dx = 0;

          }

 9. Note: We use double for distances? The constraints: coordinates and radii up to 1e6 and 2e6, so squared values up to (2e6)^2 = 4e12? which is within double? Actually, double has 52 bits for mantissa, which can represent integers exactly up to 2^52 ~ 4e15? So 4e12 is safe? But we can also use long long? 

        However, the condition: we are comparing squared distances. The inputs are integers. We can use long long for the squared distances? But note: the radii can be up to 2000000, so r*r can be 4e12? which is within long long (which is 64-bit, and 4e12 is 4 * 10^12, which is about 40 bits?).

        But note: the problem says: the circle center coordinates can be negative? But the squared values are positive.

        We can change to integer arithmetic to avoid floating point inaccuracies? 

        Therefore, let's use long long for squared distances.

        Steps:

          For filtering circles: 
            dx = ...; dy = ...; 
            condition: dx*dx + dy*dy < (long long)r*r   (but note: r is integer, so r*r is integer)

          For circle-boundary: similarly, we use long long for the squared distances? and compare with (long long)r*r.

          For circle-circle: d_sq = (long long)(fx_i - fx_j)*(fx_i - fx_j) + (long long)(fy_i - fy_j)*(fy_i - fy_j);
          condition: d_sq <= (long long)(r_i+r_j)*(r_i+r_j)

        However, note: the circle centers and radii are integers? So we can do all in integers.

        But the problem: the circle centers can be negative? But the differences are integers, and the squares are nonnegative.

        Therefore, we change to long long.

        Let's update the code accordingly.

        We must be cautious: the multiplication: (fx - x1) might be as large as 2e6? then squared: 4e12 -> long long is 64-bit, which is enough.

        However, note: the radii for circle-circle: (r_i+r_j) might be up to 2e6+2e6 = 4e6? then squared: 16e12, which is 1.6e13? which is still within long long (which can go up to about 9e18).

        So we do:

          For filtering a circle:
            long long dx = ...;
            long long dy = ...;
            long long d_sq = dx*dx + dy*dy;
            if (d_sq < (long long)r*r) // but note: if the circle center is inside the rectangle, then dx and dy are 0 -> d_sq=0, and r*r>=1, so condition holds.

          Similarly for the boundaries.

        But note: the boundaries: we computed d_sq as above? And we compare with (long long)r*r.

        For circle-circle: 
            long long dx = fx_i - fx_j;
            long long dy = fy_i - fy_j;
            long long d_sq = dx*dx + dy*dy;
            long long r_sum = (long long)r_i + r_j;
            if (d_sq <= r_sum * r_sum) // then connect.

 10. Code accordingly.

 11. One more thing: the boundaries are defined as integers? We are using integer arithmetic? Then we must cast the circle center coordinates? Actually, they are integers.

        We'll store kept_circles as vector<tuple<long long, long long, long long>>? Actually, we can store as long long? Or we can store the original integers? But the differences: we are subtracting integers? So we can use long long for the differences.

        We'll read the integers as long long? Or int? The constraints: up to 1e6 -> int is 32-bit? which is up to about 2e9? so 1e6 is safe? But then we do multiplication: 1e6 * 1e6 = 1e12 -> which is within long long? But if we use int, then the multiplication might overflow? 

        Therefore, we read the coordinates and radii as long long? Or we can use long long for the squared values and keep the original as int? Actually, we can read as long long to be safe.

        Alternatively, we read as int and then cast to long long when computing squared differences.

        Example: 
            long long dx = (long long)fx_i - (long long)fx_j;

        But the circle centers: we stored in kept_circles? We should store as long long.

        Steps:

          We'll read x1,y1,x2,y2,N as integers? But the constraints: -1000000 to 1000000 -> we can use int.

          But to avoid overflow in multiplication, we cast to long long.

        Alternatively, we can use:

          vector<array<long long, 3>> kept_circles;

        Then when reading:

          long long fx, fy, r;
          cin >> fx >> fy >> r;

        Then we do the filtering? 

        But the filtering condition: we compute dx and dy as:

          long long dx = 0;
          if (fx < x1) dx = (long long)x1 - fx;
          else if (fx > x2) dx = fx - (long long)x2;

          similarly for dy.

        Then d_sq = dx*dx + dy*dy;

        Then compare with (long long)r*r.

        So we do:

          long long x1, y1, x2, y2;
          int N;
          // but the problem says the input integers? We read as long long.

        Actually, let's read all integers as long long? to avoid casting.

        So:

          long long x1, y1, x2, y2, N;
          cin >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2 >> N;

          Then for each circle: 
            long long fx, fy, r;
            cin >> fx >> fy >> r;

        Then proceed.

        However, note: N is at most 1000, so storing as long long is fine.

 12. Code accordingly.

 13. One more note: the condition for the boundaries: 

        For left boundary: 
          if (fy >= y1 && fy <= y2) -> then dx = |fx - x1|? Actually, we compute dx = fx - x1? and then d_sq = dx*dx? But note: we want the squared Euclidean distance? And if the point is between y1 and y2, then the closest point is (x1, fy)? Then the distance is |fx-x1|? Then squared is (fx-x1)^2.

        Similarly for the others.

 14. Let's code accordingly.

 15. Time: O(N^2) for the circle pairs? N<=1000 -> 1000*1000 = 1e6, which is acceptable in 0.5 seconds? Yes.

 16. Memory: O(N^2) for the graph? Actually, the graph has at most 1000+4 nodes and edges: the circle-circle edges: O(N^2) -> 1e6 edges? and circle-boundary: O(N) -> total edges about 1e6? which is acceptable.

 17. We'll write the code accordingly.

 Let me write the code in C++.

 Note: we must reset the BFS for the second run.

 However, we do two separate BFS: first from left to right, then from bottom to top? And if the first BFS found a path, we break and output "NO". Then we do the second only if the first didn't find.

 But in the code above, we break the first BFS if we found the right boundary? Then we output "NO". Otherwise, we reset and run the second BFS.

 We'll do:

   bool found = false;
   // BFS from left to right
   ... (if found, output "NO" and return)

   // Then BFS from bottom to top
   ... (if found, output "NO", else "YES")

 18. Implementation of BFS: we use queue.

 19. Let's code accordingly.

 20. We note: the boundaries are stored as nodes: left = n, right = n+1, bottom = n+2, top = n+3.

 21. We assume 0-indexed for the kept circles.

 22. We'll use vector for graph: graph[i] is the list of neighbors for node i.

 23. We build the graph for the kept circles and the boundaries.

 24. Now, code.
