 We are going to follow the approach described in the editorial guidelines.
 Steps:
 1. Handle special cases: T=0 and K=N.
 2. Sort the array of arrival times A.
 3. Precompute prefix sums for A.
 4. Generate candidate thresholds m: 0, T-1, and for each a in A: a and a-1 (if within [0, T-1]).
 5. For each candidate m:
      - Count r: number of elements <= m (using bisect_right).
      - If K <= r:
          cost = (m+1)*(r - K) + (P[K] - P[r])
          Explanation: 
            We have r subordinates that are <= m. We want only K of them to be <= m (so we push r-K of them to m+1, costing (m+1 - original) for each? 
            But note: we can also lower some? Actually, we don't need to lower. We want to have exactly K subordinates at or below m? 
            Actually, the meeting time S will be chosen between m and m+1 (a non-integer). Then we require that exactly K subordinates have arrival time <= m (so they are present at time m+Îµ) and the others are >= m+1.
            How to achieve that?
            We can leave the K smallest ones (among the r) as <= m? Actually, we might have to push some above m? But note: we can also lower some that are above m? 
            However, the cost calculation in the editorial is: 
                cost = (m+1)*(r-K) + (P[K] - P[r])
            This implies:
                We are going to leave the smallest K ones (from the first r) at their original value? Actually, no: 
                We are going to leave the first K ones (which are the smallest) as they are? But then what about the next (r-K)? 
            Actually, we can break the array into two parts: 
                We want the first r subordinates to be adjusted so that the first K remain <= m and the next (r-K) are pushed to m+1? 
            But note: if we push an element a_i (which is originally <= m) to m+1, we pay (m+1 - a_i). Alternatively, we can lower some that are above m? 
            However, we are only allowed to push up? Because if we lower, we might get below 0? 

            Actually, the problem allows both increasing and decreasing. But note: we cannot have an arrival time < 0. So if we have an element that is above m, we can lower it to m? 

            The idea: 
              We want exactly K subordinates to be <= m and the rest (n-K) to be >= m+1.
              How to fix the array?
                - For the r subordinates that are originally <= m: we can leave up to K of them at or below m, and we must push the remaining (r-K) to at least m+1.
                - For the n-r subordinates that are originally > m: we must push down at least (r + (K - r))? Actually, if we are short of K (i.e., K>r), then we need to bring down some from above m to be <= m? But note: we require exactly K in total <= m.

            Therefore, for the case K <= r:
                We have too many in the <= m group. We want to push (r-K) of them to m+1 (or beyond). The cheapest way is to take the largest (r-K) of these r (i.e., the ones with the largest original times) and push them to m+1. The cost for each one is (m+1 - a_i). 
                But note: we might also consider lowering some of the ones above m to become <= m? However, we don't need to because we already have too many? So we only push the extra ones up.

            However, wait: the cost expression in the editorial is: (m+1)*(r-K) + (P[K] - P[r])
                = (m+1)*(r-K) + (sum of the first K) - (sum of the first r)
                = (m+1)*(r-K) - (sum_{i=K}^{r-1} A[i])

            Why? Because the first r are sorted: A[0] ... A[r-1]. Then P[K] = A[0]+...+A[K-1] and P[r] = A[0]+...+A[r-1]. 
            Then P[K] - P[r] = - (A[K] + ... + A[r-1]).

            So the expression becomes: (m+1)*(r-K) - (A[K] + ... + A[r-1])

            But note: pushing the largest (r-K) ones (which are A[K] to A[r-1]) from their current value to m+1 costs: 
                for each a in A[K:r]: (m+1 - a) = (r-K)*(m+1) - (sum_{i=K}^{r-1} A[i])
            That is exactly the expression.

            So that matches.

      - If K > r:
          We are short by s = K - r. We need to bring s subordinates from the group that are originally > m down to at most m. However, we cannot push them below 0? But note: m is at least 0 and we are pushing them to m? Actually, we can push them to any value <= m? The cheapest ones to push down are the smallest ones in the group above m? Because they are the closest to m.

          We take the next s (smallest) from the group above m (which are the first s in the sorted array from index r to n-1) and push them to m? Actually, we can push them to m? Then the cost for each one a_i is (a_i - m). But note: we are allowed to push arbitrarily? However, we don't have to push exactly to m? We can push to any value between 0 and m? So the minimal cost for one a_i is (a_i - m) if we push down to m? Actually, we can push to any value between 0 and m, but the minimal cost is achieved by pushing to m? Because if we push to a value less than m, we pay more? Actually, no: we are only required to have the arrival time <= m. So we can push to m to minimize the distance? Actually, the minimal cost is (a_i - m) if we push to m, but we might push to a value greater than m? That doesn't help. So we push to m? 

          However, note: the meeting time S is non-integer and we are going to set it between m and m+1. So if we set the arrival time to m, that is acceptable. Therefore, the cost for an element a_i (which is originally > m) is (a_i - m) to push it to m.

          Then the total cost for these s elements is: sum_{i=r}^{r+s-1} (a_i - m) = (sum_{i=r}^{r+s-1} a_i) - s * m.

          But note: we might also have to adjust the ones that are already above m? Actually, we are only adjusting the ones we choose to bring down? And we choose the smallest s ones? 

          So the expression: (P[r+s] - P[r]) - s * m.

          However, note: if r+s > n, then we don't have enough elements to bring down? Then we skip this candidate.

 6. We take the minimum cost over all candidate m.

 7. However, note: we must also consider that the adjustments must not make any subordinate arrive before 0 or after T. But in our cost calculation, when we push an element down to m, we are only pushing down to m (which is at least 0) and when we push an element up to m+1, we are pushing to m+1 (which is at most T, because m is at most T-1). So the constraints are satisfied.

 8. But what if we cannot achieve exactly K? The problem says if impossible output -1. However, we have generated candidate m and if for a candidate we have r+s <= n (when K>r) then we can do it? What about the case when we cannot get exactly K? Actually, the problem says: if impossible output -1.

    Why might it be impossible?
        - If T=0 and K != n -> impossible.
        - Otherwise, is there a scenario? 
          Note: we are allowed to adjust arbitrarily as long as the arrival time is in [0, T]. 
          But if we require K subordinates and we have to have at least one subordinate that we cannot adjust to be in the meeting? 

        Actually, the constraints: 
          - We can set any non-integer S. So we can choose any interval (m, m+1) for m in [0, T-1]. 
          - We can adjust the arrival times arbitrarily (with cost) as long as they are in [0, T]. 

        Therefore, the only impossibility is when T=0 and K != n? And also if T=0 and K=n, then we can set all to 0? 

        But note the fourth sample: 
            "2 1 0
             0 0"
            Output: -1.

        Why? 
            T=0: the subordinates must arrive at 0? They are already at 0. But we require exactly 1 to be present? 
            However, if we start at S (a positive non-integer) then both subordinates are present at time S (because they are at 0, and 0 < S). So we have 2, not 1.

        How can we fix to get exactly 1?
            We have to push one of them to become >0? But T=0, so we cannot push to a positive time because that would be > T=0. 
            Alternatively, we can push one of them to become negative? But that is not allowed (arrival time must be >=0). 

        Therefore, we cannot have one of them not present? So we have to have either both (if we do nothing) or if we try to push one to a later time, we cannot because T=0. 

        Also, we cannot push one to an earlier time? But that would be negative -> not allowed.

        So the condition: 
            When T=0, we are forced to have all subordinates at 0. Then at any positive non-integer S, all are present. Therefore, we can only have K = n. Otherwise, it's impossible.

        But note: the problem says "subordinate must not arrive strictly later than T". So if T=0, then they must arrive at 0.

        So we have already handled T=0: if K != n then output -1.

        However, what about other cases? 
          Consider: we require exactly K. But we can adjust arbitrarily? So if we have at least K subordinates that we can adjust to be in [0, T] and at least n-K that we can adjust to be above m+1 (which is <= T) then we can do it? 

        Actually, we are allowed to push any subordinate arbitrarily as long as the new time is in [0, T]. So the only constraint is that we cannot get an arrival time outside [0, T]. 

        Therefore, the candidate m must be in [0, T-1]. Our candidate set is within [0, T-1] (because we include 0, T-1, and a_i and a_i-1 only if in [0, T-1]).

        But what if we have a candidate m that we can use? Then we can achieve the configuration. 

        However, note: we might not be able to get enough subordinates above m+1? For example, if we have many subordinates that we have to push down to m (so they become <= m) and we also have to push others to m+1? But we are allowed to push arbitrarily as long as in [0, T]. So if m+1 <= T, then we can push to m+1? 

        Therefore, the only impossibility is when T=0 and K != n.

        But wait: what if T=0 and K=n? Then we can do it (cost 0). 

        So our algorithm: 
          - For T=0: if K==n -> 0, else -1.
          - For K==n: 0.

          Otherwise, we generate candidate m and compute the cost. Then we take the minimal cost.

        However, what if we don't find any candidate? Actually, we generate at least 0 and T-1 (if T>=1) and also the a_i and a_i-1 that are in [0, T-1]. But note: the array A is in [0, T]. So we have at least the candidate 0 and T-1? 

        But what if T=0? Then we skip the general case.

        However, we have handled T=0 at the beginning.

        But what if we have no candidate? Actually, the set candidates is non-empty because we add 0 and T-1 (if T>=1) and if T==0 we skip. So for T>=1, we have at least 0 and T-1.

        However, note: if T==0, we handled separately.

        Therefore, we are safe.

 9. But note: the third sample: 
        "2 1 1
         0 0"
        Output: 1.

        How does our algorithm handle?
          T=1, so we do not enter the T==0 block.
          K=1, n=2 -> K != n -> so we proceed.

          Sort A: [0,0]
          Prefix P: [0,0,0]

          Candidates: 
            m=0 -> included (0 and T-1=0, also a_i=0 -> 0, and a_i-1=-1 -> skip, so candidates: {0, 1-1=0} -> so candidate set {0}? Actually:
                candidates.add(0) -> {0}
                candidates.add(T-1) -> T-1=0 -> still {0}
                for a in A (which are 0 and 0): 
                  a=0: add 0 -> no change; then a-1=-1 -> skip.
                So candidate set: {0}.

          Then for m=0:
            r = bisect_right(A,0) -> 2 (because [0,0] and bisect_right(0) returns the index after the last 0 -> 2? Actually, the array has two elements: A[0]=0, A[1]=0. bisect_right returns the insertion position for 0+eps? Actually, bisect_right(A,0) returns the index at which 0 would be inserted to maintain sorted order? Actually, bisect_right returns the insertion position that comes after the last 0. So for [0,0], bisect_right(0) returns 2.

            Then: K=1, r=2 -> so K<=r: use the formula for K<=r.
                cost = (0+1)*(2-1) + (P[1] - P[2])
                P[1] = A[0] = 0
                P[2] = A[0]+A[1]=0
                cost = 1*(1) + (0 - 0) = 1.

          So we output 1.

 10. The fourth sample: 
        "2 1 0
         0 0"
        We output -1 (handled by T==0 and K!=n).

 11. The second sample:
        "4 2 4
         1 2 2 4"
        Output: 1.

        How?
          T=4, n=4, K=2.
          Sort A: [1,2,2,4]
          P: [0,1,3,5,9]

          Candidates: 
            m=0, m=3 (T-1=3), and for each a in A: 
                a=1 -> candidates: 1,0 -> but 0 already there, so add 1 and 0? -> we have 0,1,3.
                a=2 -> candidates: 2,1 -> 0,1,2,3.
                a=2 -> same -> 0,1,2,3.
                a=4 -> 4 (but 4 is not <= T-1=3 -> skip) and 3 -> already there.

          Candidates: {0,1,2,3}

          We try each candidate:

          m=0:
            r = number of elements <=0 -> only the first element? Actually, A[0]=1 -> no element <=0? So r=0.
            Then K=2>0 -> s=2. We need the next 2 from the group above 0? which are A[0] and A[1] -> 1 and 2.
            cost = (P[0+2] - P[0]) - 2*0 = (P[2]-P[0]) = 3 - 0 = 3.

          m=1:
            r = number of elements <=1 -> 1 (only the first element 1)
            Then K=2>1 -> s=1. We need one more: the next one (A[1]=2) -> cost = (P[1+1] - P[1]) - 1*1 = (P[2]-P[1]) - 1 = (3-1) - 1 = 1.

          m=2:
            r = number of elements <=2 -> 3 (the first three: 1,2,2)
            Then K=2<=3 -> cost = (2+1)*(3-2) + (P[2] - P[3]) = 3*1 + (3 - 5) = 3 - 2 = 1.

          m=3:
            r = number of elements<=3 -> 3 (the first three: 1,2,2; 4 is >3)
            Then K=2<=3 -> cost = (3+1)*(3-2) + (P[2]-P[3]) = 4*1 + (3-5)= 4 -2 = 2.

          The minimum cost is min(3,1,1,2) = 1.

          So we output 1.

          But note: there are two candidates (m=1 and m=2) that yield cost 1. So we pick 1.

 12. Implementation note: We use bisect_right to count r: 
          r = bisect.bisect_right(A, m)   # because A is sorted, then the number of elements <= m is the index where m+eps would be inserted? Actually, bisect_right(A, m) returns the insertion position to the right of the last m. So it returns the first index at which the element is > m. Therefore, the count of elements <= m is exactly that index.

      Example: A = [1,2,2,4], m=2 -> bisect_right returns 3? because the array is [1,2,2,4] and at index3 we have 4 which is >2. So r=3.

 13. However, note: we are using the entire array? 

 14. Code: We precompute prefix sums for the entire sorted array.

 15. But note: the prefix P: 
        P[0]=0
        P[1]=A[0]
        P[2]=A[0]+A[1]
        ... 

 16. In the formula for K<=r:
        cost = (m+1)*(r-K) + (P[K] - P[r])
        Here, note: r is the count (so r is the number of elements <= m). Then we are considering the first r elements? But note: the sorted array is A[0] ... A[r-1] that are <= m. Then:
            P[K] = sum of the first K elements (if K<=r) -> but what if K>r? that case is handled separately.

        Actually, the prefix P is defined for the entire sorted array. So P[i] = sum of A[0] to A[i-1].

        Therefore, the sum of the first K elements is P[K] and the sum of the first r elements is P[r].

        Then for the case K<=r: we are subtracting the sum of the first r from the sum of the first K? That doesn't make sense? Actually:

            We are doing: (P[K] - P[r]) = (sum of first K) - (sum of first r) = negative? 

        But note: we are pushing the elements from index K to r-1 (which are the ones we are pushing up) and we are subtracting the entire segment? 

        Actually, the formula is: 
            cost = (m+1)*(r-K) - (sum_{i=K}^{r-1} A[i])
        and note: 
            (sum_{i=K}^{r-1} A[i]) = P[r] - P[K]

        So: cost = (m+1)*(r-K) - (P[r]-P[K])

        But our code does: (m+1)*(r-K) + (P[K] - P[r]) = (m+1)*(r-K) - (P[r]-P[K]) -> which is the same.

        So that is correct.

 17. For K>r:
        We need the next s (s=K-r) elements? They are the first s elements in the segment starting at r (which are the smallest in the group above m). 
        The sum of these s elements is P[r+s] - P[r].

        Then cost = (P[r+s]-P[r]) - s*m.

 18. But what if r+s > n? Then we skip the candidate? Because we don't have enough elements to bring down.

        Why? We require s=K-r, but if r+s = r + (K-r) = K, and if K>n? Actually, K<=n (from input: 1<=K<=N). And r is at most n, so r+s = K, which is <=n? 

        However, note: r is the count of elements <= m, then we have n-r elements above m. We need s=K-r of them. So if n-r < s, then we cannot get s elements? That is, if n-r < K-r -> n < K -> which is impossible because K<=n.

        Therefore, we always have at least (K-r) <= (n-r) -> so we have at least s elements? Then why the condition?

        Actually, the condition in the code: 
            if r+s > n: then skip.

        But note: r+s = r + (K-r) = K, and K<=n -> so r+s = K <= n? Then we never skip? 

        However, what if we are using the entire array? Then we have n elements. So r+s = K <= n -> so we never skip? 

        But wait: the prefix sum array P is of length n+1. We can access P[r+s] as long as r+s <= n? Actually, we have defined P for indices 0..n. So P[r+s] is defined for r+s in [0, n].

        Therefore, we do not need the skip? Then why in the editorial it says "if r+s>n, then continue"? 

        Actually, in the editorial, the code snippet in Python has:
            if K <= r:
                ...
            else:
                s = K - r
                if r + s > n:
                    continue
                ...

        But as we deduced, r+s = K <= n -> so we don't need to check? 

        However, note: in our candidate set, m might be such that r is the count of elements <= m. Then we are taking the next s elements from the remaining (n-r) elements. We have n-r >= s? because s = K - r and K <= n, and r>=0 -> K-r <= n-r? 

        Therefore, we always have at least s elements above m? So we don't need the condition? 

        But wait: what if m is very large? For example, m = T-1 and T is very large, then r might be n? Then K>r -> K>n -> impossible? But we know K<=n.

        Actually, if m is T-1, then the condition: 
            r = number of elements <= T-1 -> which might be n? Then if K>r -> K>n -> but K<=n, so that case never happens? 

        Therefore, the condition "if r+s>n" is actually redundant? 

        However, to be safe, we can remove it? But the editorial has it. 

        Actually, let me check: 
            r is the count of elements <= m -> r<=n.
            s = K - r -> then r+s = K, which is <=n? So we don't need the condition? 

        But what if we have an array with duplicates and the candidate m is such that the entire array is <= m? Then r = n. Then if K>r -> K>n -> but K<=n, so that case is impossible? 

        Therefore, we can remove the condition? 

        However, the editorial has it. Maybe for the case when we have candidate m that is negative? But we are generating m in [0, T-1]. So it's safe.

        Actually, the condition is redundant. But we leave it as in the editorial? Or we remove? 

        Since the problem constraints say K<=N, we can skip the condition? 

        But note: the condition is there to avoid indexing beyond the array? Actually, if we have r+s = K, then we need to access P[r+s] = P[K]. Since we have P[0..n] (with n+1 elements), we can access P[K] as long as K<=n? 

        Therefore, we can remove the condition? 

        However, in the code we have: 
            P = [0]*(n+1) -> indices from 0 to n.

            Then for index r+s: 
                if r+s <= n, then P[r+s] is defined? Actually, yes: because r+s=K<=n.

        So we can remove the condition.

        But the editorial code has the condition? 

        Actually, the editorial code in Python has the condition. Why? 

        I see: the condition is "if r + s > n: continue". But if K>n, then we skip? But K<=n, so it's redundant.

        We'll remove the condition? Or leave it? 

        Since the problem says K<=n, we can remove it? But to be safe against off-by-one? 

        Actually, r+s = K, and we have P defined for indices up to n (inclusive). Then we can do:
            cost_val = (P[r+s] - P[r]) - s * m

        without condition.

        However, note: r is in [0, n] and s=K-r, so r+s = K, which is in [0, n]? 

        But what if K=0? The problem says K>=1. So K>=1 and K<=n.

        Therefore, we can safely remove the condition? 

        But let me check the sample: 
            n=4, K=2, r=1 -> s=1, then r+s=2, which is <=4 -> we can compute.

        However, the problem constraints: K>=1 and K<=n. So we remove the condition.

        But wait: what if we have m such that r=0 and K=1? Then s=1, and we access P[0] and P[1] -> which is defined.

        Therefore, we remove the condition.

        However, the sample input "4 2 4" with A=[1,2,2,4] for candidate m=1: 
            r = 1 (because only the first element is <=1? Actually, the array is [1,2,2,4] -> 1<=1 -> count=1? Then the next element is 2 which is >1? 
            Then s=1 -> we take one element from the remaining 3? The next smallest one is 2? 
            Then cost = (P[1+1]-P[1]) - 1*1 = (P[2]-P[1]) - 1 = (1+2 - 1) - 1 = (3-1)-1 = 1.

        Correct.

        But what if we remove the condition? Then we don't skip any candidate? 

        So we'll remove the condition.

 19. However, the editorial code in the problem statement has the condition? 

        We are going to write the code as in the editorial? 

        But the problem constraints guarantee K<=n. So the condition is redundant. But to be safe for future changes? Or to match the editorial? 

        Since the problem statement says "follow the editorial exactly", we will leave the condition? 

        Actually, the editorial says:
            if r + s > n:
                continue

        So we will leave it? Even though it is redundant? 

        Why? Because if we have a candidate m that is not in the valid set? Actually, we generated m in [0, T-1] so that m+1<=T. But what if we have a candidate m that is T? Then we skip? But we don't generate m>=T? 

        Actually, we generate m in [0, T-1]. 

        Therefore, we remove the condition? 

        But the editorial says: "if r+s>n, then continue". We are going to follow the editorial exactly. So we include the condition.

        However, note: the condition is redundant? Then we can skip it? But we include it to match the editorial.

 20. But wait: what if we have a candidate m that is negative? We don't generate negatives. So we are safe.

 21. Final code:

        Read n, K, T and the array A.

        if T == 0:
            if K == n:
                print(0)
            else:
                print(-1)
            return

        if K == n:
            print(0)
            return

        Sort A.
        Precompute prefix P: size n+1.

        candidates = set()
        candidates.add(0)
        if T-1 >= 0:   # which is true because T>=1 (since T==0 handled above)
            candidates.add(T-1)
        for a in A:
            if a >= 0 and a <= T-1:
                candidates.add(a)
            if a-1 >= 0 and a-1 <= T-1:
                candidates.add(a-1)

        best = a big number (like 10**18 for C++: LLONG_MAX? or 1e18)

        for each m in candidates:
            r = upper_bound(A, m) - A.begin();   // in C++: the count of elements <= m is the number of elements in [begin, it) where it is the first element > m -> that is the index.

            Actually, we can do: 
                int r = upper_bound(A.begin(), A.end(), m) - A.begin();

            Then:
            if (K <= r) {
                cost = (m+1) * (r - K) + (P[K] - P[r]);
            } else {
                int s = K - r;
                if (r + s > n) {   // redundant but as per editorial
                    continue;
                }
                cost = (P[r+s] - P[r]) - s * m;
            }

            best = min(best, cost);

        Then output best.

 22. But note: the third sample: 
        "2 1 1
         0 0"
        We computed cost=1 for m=0.

        However, what if we try m=1? 
            r = upper_bound([0,0],1) -> returns the index after the last element? which is 2.
            Then K=1<=2 -> cost = (1+1)*(2-1) + (P[1]-P[2]) = 2*1 + (0 - 0)=2.

        So the minimum is 1 (for m=0).

 23. One more: 
        Sample Input: "4 2 4
                       1 2 3 4"
        Output: 0.

        How?
          Candidates: 
            m=0 -> r=0 -> then s=2 -> cost = (P[0+2]-P[0]) - 2*0 = (1+2) - 0 = 3.
            m=1: 
                r = count of <=1: 1 -> then s=1 -> cost = (P[1+1]-P[1]) - 1*1 = (1+2 - 1) -1 = (3-1)-1=1.
            m=2: 
                r=2 -> then K=2<=2 -> cost = (2+1)*(0) + (P[2]-P[2]) = 0.
            m=3: 
                r=3 -> cost = (3+1)*(1) + (P[2]-P[3]) = 4 + (3 - (1+2+3)) = 4 + (3-6)=4-3=1.
            m= T-1=3 -> already considered.

          Then the minimum cost is 0.

 24. Therefore, we output 0.

 Implementation in C++:

              }

              if (T == 0) {
                  if (K == n) {
                      cout << 0 << endl;
                  } else {
                      cout << -1 << endl;
                  }
                  return 0;
              }

              if (K == n) {
                  cout << 0 << endl;
                  return 0;

              }

              set<long long> candidates;
              candidates.insert(0);
              if (T-1 >= 0) {
                  candidates.insert(T-1);
              }
              for (long long a : A) {

                      candidates.insert(a);
                  }
                  if (a-1 >= 0 && a-1 <= T-1) {
                      candidates.insert(a-1);
                  }
              }

              long long best = (long long)1e18;
              for (long long m : candidates) {
                  // Count r: number of elements <= m
                  auto it = upper_bound(A.begin(), A.end(), m);
                  long long r = it - A.begin();

                  if (K <= r) {
                      long long cost = (m+1) * (r - K) + (P[K] - P[r]);
                      if (cost < best) {
                          best = cost;
                      }
                  } else {
                      long long s = K - r;
                      if (r + s > n) {
                          continue;
                      }
                      long long cost = (P[r+s] - P[r]) - s * m;
                      if (cost < best) {
                          best = cost;
                      }
                  }
              }

              cout << best << endl;
              return 0;
          }

 25. But note: the sample "2 1 0" is handled by the T==0 block: output -1.

 26. However, the problem constraints: T can be up to 1000000000, and n up to 100000. The candidate set has at most 2*n + 2 elements? So about 200000 candidates? Then we do 200000 binary searches (each O(log n)) -> total O(200000 * log(100000)) which is acceptable? 

        log2(100000) is about 17, so 200000 * 17 = 3.4e6 operations -> acceptable.

 27. But note: the candidate set is stored in a set, so we iterate over unique candidates. The worst-case number of unique candidates is 200000? 

        So we do 200000 iterations, each with a binary search (which is O(log n)).

 28. Let's test with a worst-case: n=100000, then we have 100000*2 + 2 = 200002 candidates? Then 200002 * log2(100000) ~ 200000*17 = 3.4e6 -> acceptable in C++.

 29. However, note: the problem time limit is 1.0s? We must be cautious.

        We can avoid the inner binary search? 

        Actually, we are doing:
            for each candidate m: 
                r = upper_bound(A, m) - A.begin();

        But note: the candidate set is generated from A and the set is sorted? Then we can iterate the candidate set in sorted order and use two pointers? 

        Alternatively, we can note that the function f(m) = (number of elements <= m) is monotonic? But the cost function is not? 

        Since the candidate set is not too big (200000) and the binary search is O(log n) per candidate, we do it.

 30. One more sample: the third sample "2 1 1" with A=[0,0] -> candidate set {0}. Then we do:
        r = upper_bound([0,0],0) -> returns index 2? Because the array is [0,0] and upper_bound(0) returns the first index where element>0? which is 2? So r=2.

        Then K=1<=2 -> cost = (0+1)*(2-1) + (P[1]-P[2]) 
            P[1] = 0
            P[2] = 0
            cost = 1 + (0-0) = 1.

        Correct.

 31. Edge: what if candidate m is negative? We don't generate negatives.

 32. Let's run the code on the provided samples.

 33. But note: the condition in the else branch: 
        if (r+s > n) continue;
        As discussed, r+s=K<=n, so we never skip? Then we can remove it? 

        However, we follow the editorial. So we leave it.

 34. Code:

        We use long long for T, m, and the cost because T up to 1e9 and n up to 100000 -> worst-case cost might be about 1e9 * 100000 = 1e14, which fits in long long (which is typically 64-bit).

 35. Let me check the worst-case cost? 
        In the case K<=r: 
            (m+1)*(r-K) -> m+1 up to T (which is 1e9) and (r-K) up to 100000 -> 1e9 * 1e5 = 1e14 -> fits in long long.

        Similarly, the other term: P[K]-P[r] is at most 100000 * T = 1e5 * 1e9 = 1e14 -> so we are safe.

 36. Final C++ code:

        Note: We must be cautious with the prefix array: P[0]=0, P[i] for i from 1 to n.

        We'll write accordingly.

 37. One more sample: 
        Input: "4 2 4
                1 2 2 4"

        We did above: candidate m=1: cost=1, m=2: cost=1 -> so the answer is 1.

        But what if we have multiple candidates with the same value? The set will remove duplicates.

 38. Run:

        candidates: {0,1,2,3} -> then we compute for each.

        m=0: r=0 -> s=2 -> cost = (P[2]-P[0]) - 2*0 = (1+2) - 0 = 3.
        m=1: r=1 -> s=1 -> cost = (P[2]-P[1]) - 1*1 = (3-1) -1 = 1.
        m=2: r=3 -> cost = (2+1)*(3-2) + (P[2]-P[3]) = 3 + (3-5) = 3-2=1.
        m=3: r=3 -> cost = (3+1)*(3-2) + (P[2]-P[3]) = 4 + (3-5)=2.

        Then best=1.

 39. Therefore, we output 1.

                    // But the problem says if impossible output -1. 
                    // We already handled T=0 and K=n. 
                    // But what if for every candidate m we had the else branch condition skip? 
                    // Actually, the condition is redundant and we know that r+s=K<=n, so we never skip? 
                    // Therefore, we should always update best? 
                    // But what if we have no candidate? Then we output 1e18? 
                    // Actually, the set cand is non-empty? 
                    // But if T==0 we handled above. 
                    // So we don't need to output -1? 
                    // But the problem says: if impossible output -1. 
                    // We have already handled T=0 and K!=n -> output -1. 
                    // And for T>=1, we have the candidate set non-empty? 
                    // Therefore, we don't need to check? 
                    // However, to be safe? 
                    // We'll output best if we found a candidate. 
                    // But if best remains 1e18, then we output -1? 
                    // But the problem says it might be impossible? 
                    // Actually, the only impossibility we found is T=0 and K!=n. 
                    // So for T>=1, it should always be possible? 
                    // Why? 
                    //   We can choose m in [0, T-1] arbitrarily. 
                    //   We can adjust the arrival times arbitrarily (as long as in [0,T]) to achieve exactly K subordinates <= m and the rest >= m+1. 
                    //   The cost might be huge? but we can always do it? 
                    //   For example, we can push all the subordinates we want to be in the meeting to 0 and all the others to T? 
                    //   But that might be expensive? but we are computing the minimal cost. 
                    //   The problem does not say that it might be impossible for T>=1? 
                    //   But the constraints: 
                    //      "subordinate must not arrive strictly before you" -> we set to 0 (which is not strictly before? it's at the same time) -> allowed? 
                    //      The problem says: "a subordinate must not arrive at the office strictly before you" -> so 0 is allowed? 
                    //   Therefore, we can always set the ones we want to be in the meeting to 0 and the others to T? 
                    //   Then we can set the meeting time S to 0.5? Then the ones at 0 are present, the ones at T are not (if T>0.5). 
                    //   But if T is 0.5? Then we cannot set the meeting time to 0.5? But note: T is integer? and S is non-integer? 
                    //   Actually, T is integer? The problem says: T is an integer in [0,1000000000]. 
                    //   Then we can set S to 0.5? 
                    //   Therefore, for T>=1, it is always possible? 
                    //   Then we don't need to output -1? 

                    //   But wait: what if T=0.5? Actually, T is integer. 
                    //   Therefore, we always have a solution for T>=1? 

                    //   So we don't need to output -1? 

                    //   However, the problem statement says: "If it is impossible to do so, output -1."

                    //   And we have handled T=0 and K!=n -> output -1. 

                    //   Then for T>=1, we must have found at least one candidate? 

                    //   Therefore, we don't set best to -1? 

                    //   But what if the candidate set is empty? 
                    //        cand.insert(0) -> if T>=1, then T-1>=0 -> cand has 0 and T-1? 
                    //        So at least two candidates? 

                    //   Therefore, we output best.

                    //   We do not need to output -1 here.

                    //   But if we did not update best? Then we output 1e18? 

                    //   Since we have candidates and we always update? Then we output the best.

                    //   So we don't need an extra check.

                }

                cout << best << endl;

                return 0;
            }

 41. However, the problem sample input: 
        "2 1 0
         0 0"
        is handled by T==0 and K!=n -> output -1.

 42. Therefore, we output best.

 43. But what if T>=1 and there is a candidate that we skip in the else branch? We never skip because the condition is redundant? 

        Actually, we skip if r+s>n? But that never happens? Then we always update? 

 44. Final code: 

        We run as above.

 45. Let me run the sample that the editorial provided: 
        Input: "4 2 4
                1 2 3 4" -> output 0.

        Input: "4 2 4
                1 2 2 4" -> output 1.

        Input: "2 1 1
                0 0" -> output 1.

        Input: "2 1 0
                0 0" -> output -1.

 46. We'll run the code on these.

 47. One more: 
        Input: "2 1 1
                0 0"

        Our code: 
            T=1 -> not 0, K=1 != n (n=2) -> so proceed.
            Sort: [0,0]
            P: [0,0,0]
            Candidates: {0} (because T-1=0, and a=0 -> add 0, and a-1=-1 -> skip)
            Then for m=0: 
                r = upper_bound([0,0],0) -> 2.
                K=1<=2 -> cost = (0+1)*(2-1) + (P[1]-P[2]) = 1*(1) + (0-0)=1.

            Then output 1.

 48. Therefore, we are confident.

 49. Code with comments removed for clarity:

        Note: We use long long for all.

        Let me test with the worst-case: n=100000, T=1000000000, and A filled with zeros? 
            Then we have candidate set: {0, T-1=999999999, and for each a=0: we add 0 and -1 (skip) -> so candidate set {0, 999999999}. 
            Then we iterate:

            m=0: 
                r = 100000 -> then if K<=100000? 
                cost = (0+1)*(100000-K) + (P[K]-P[100000])

            m=999999999:
                r = 100000 -> same.

            Then we compute the cost for m=0: 
                We are going to push (100000-K) of the zeros to 1? 
                The cost for pushing one zero to 1 is 1? 
                So total cost = (100000-K).

            For m=999999999: 
                cost = (1000000000)*(100000-K) + (P[K]-P[100000]) -> which is (1000000000)*(100000-K) - (0) = 1000000000*(100000-K) -> which is huge.

            Then the best is (100000-K).

            But what if K=50000? Then cost=50000.

        So the code runs.

 50. We output the code accordingly.

 51. Note: The condition in the else branch is redundant? But we leave it to match the editorial.

 52. Final code:
