 Okay, let's break down the problem and the editorial guidelines.

 We are given:
   - N, K: the range [1, N] and the maximum number of guesses K.
   - A string `s` of answers. The string can end with '=' or be entirely '<' and '>' of length K.

 Steps:

 1. Precomputation: We need to compute the minimal interval size required at each step to be able to complete the game with the remaining answers.

    Let M = length of the string s (which is the number of guesses made, and the game stops at '=' or after K guesses).

    We traverse backwards:

      min_size[i] = minimal size of the interval needed at step i (0-indexed) to have a chance of completing the sequence.

      For the last answer (i = M-1):
        - If the last answer is '=', then min_size[M-1] = 1 (because we must have a singleton to be correct).
        - If the last answer is '<' or '>', then min_size[M-1] = 2 (because we need at least two numbers: one for the guess and one for the remaining number that is either smaller or greater).

      For i from M-2 down to 0:
        - If at step i the answer is '<' or '>', then the next step will have an interval that must be at least min_size[i+1]. How do we get the minimal size at step i?
          We know that after making a guess, the interval is split. Theodora will choose the answer that leaves the larger part (or the left part in case of tie). Therefore, to guarantee that we can complete the sequence, we must have:

          min_size[i] = min_size[i+1] + 1   ??? 

        But note: Actually, the adversarial strategy requires that the worst-case branch (the one that leaves the larger interval) must be able to accommodate the rest. However, the minimal starting interval for step i must be at least:

          If we make a guess at step i, then the two resulting intervals are:
            - For '<': [L, guess-1]
            - For '>': [guess+1, R]

          Theodora will choose the answer that leaves the larger interval. Therefore, the worst-case interval we get is the maximum between (guess - L) and (R - guess). To minimize the total starting interval that we need, we want to choose a guess that minimizes that maximum. The minimal worst-case interval we can leave is ceil((size-1)/2). However, we require that the worst-case interval must be at least min_size[i+1].

          Actually, we can precompute the minimal starting interval for a sequence of j non-final answers (without an '=' in the middle) as follows:

          We know that after one non-final answer, we are left with at most floor((size-1)/2) or size-1? Actually, the adversarial strategy leaves the largest possible interval. So the minimal starting interval for j non-final answers is the minimal number x such that even after j splits (each time the interval being reduced to the worst-case) we have at least 1 number at the end? Actually, we can precompute:

          Let f(0) = 1   (if we have no more moves, then we need at least 1 number? Actually, if we have no moves left, then we don't need any because the game ended? But note: the precomputation is for the minimal interval size required at step i to complete the remaining answers.

          Actually, the editorial says:

          min_size[i] = 
            if i == M-1: 
                if s[i] == '=' -> 1
                else -> 2
            else:
                if s[i] == '=' -> impossible? Actually, we cannot have a non-final '='? But the problem says: the last character is '=' OR the entire string is of length K and non-equal.

          However, note: the string either ends with '=' or is entirely of '<' and '>' of length K.

          So:

          We traverse backwards:

            Let min_size[i] for the step i:

            If at step i we have an '=' (and it must be the last one) then we require 1.

            But note: the problem says the string may have an '=' in the last character and then the game stops. So the string of answers is of length M, and M might be less than K.

          Actually, the editorial approach:

          min_size[M] = 0   // after the last step, we don't require anything? Or we set for the step beyond the last? Actually, let min_size[i] be the minimal interval size required at the beginning of step i.

          Alternatively, we can define an array `req` of length M+1, where `req[i]` is the minimal interval size required at step i (i from 0 to M, and step M is after the last guess).

          We set:
            `req[M] = 1`   // because after the last guess, if we have an '=' we require exactly one number. But if the last answer is not '=', then we don't have an '='? Actually, the last step if it's non-equal we don't require anything? Actually, no: the game ends after K guesses without being correct? But note: the problem says that Theodora's answers are given, so we know the entire sequence. For a non-final step, we don't require the interval to be 1 at the end. Actually, the precomputation is for the minimal interval that can support the remaining answers.

          Let me reinterpret the editorial:

          They precompute an array `min_size` for indices from 0 to M-1.

          How?
            Start from the last step (i = M-1):
              if s[M-1] == '=', then min_size[M-1] = 1.
              else (s[M-1] is '<' or '>'), then min_size[M-1] = 2.

          Then for i from M-2 down to 0:
            min_size[i] = min_size[i+1] + 1   // but wait, that would be linear? Actually, that might be too small.

          Actually, we need to account for the adversarial split. The minimal starting interval for step i must be at least:

            If we are to make a guess and then get an answer, the worst-case split must leave an interval of at least min_size[i+1]. What is the minimal starting interval that can guarantee that?

            We note: if the current interval has size X, then after a guess we get two intervals: one of size A and one of size B (with A+B = X-1). Theodora will choose the larger one (and if tie, choose the left one which is the '<' branch). So the worst-case interval we get is:

                worst = max( A, B ) 

            But we require worst >= min_size[i+1]? Actually, we require that the interval we are forced into must be at least min_size[i+1]. Therefore, we must have:

                worst = max( A, B ) >= min_size[i+1]

            What is the minimal X such that we can split it into A and B (with A+B = X-1) and max(A,B) >= min_size[i+1]?

            Actually, the minimal X is: min_size[i] = min_size[i+1] + 1? That would be if we could always leave exactly min_size[i+1] by having A = min_size[i+1] and B = X-1 - min_size[i+1] and then if we choose the guess appropriately? But note: we are free to choose the guess.

            Actually, the minimal starting interval for step i must be:

                min_size[i] = min_size[i+1] + 1   // if the next step requires min_size[i+1] and we lose one number (the guess) and then we need to cover the worst-case which is the larger of the two sides? 

            But consider: we can choose the guess to minimize the worst-case. The minimal starting interval that can leave an interval of at least min_size[i+1] in the worst-case is:

                min_size[i] = min_size[i+1] * 2   ??? 

            Actually, think of the classic: to guarantee that we can have an interval of size S after one non-final guess, we must have at least 2*S - 1? 

            However, note: the adversarial strategy always leaves the larger part. So to guarantee that the larger part is at least S, we require:

                Let the interval be [L, R] of size X.
                We choose a guess g. Then we require:
                  max( g - L, R - g ) >= S.

                The minimal X that can satisfy this for some g is: 2*S.

                Why? Because if we split the interval such that the larger part is at least S, then the entire interval must be at least S (the larger part) + (the other part) + 1 (the guess). The worst-case is when the interval is split as evenly as possible. Actually, the minimal X such that there exists g with max(g-L, R-g) >= S is:

                  We set g as close as possible to one end? Actually, we can set g at L+S: then the left part is S numbers? Actually, the left part has size (g-L) = S, so we leave S numbers? Then the entire interval must be at least L to L+S (which is S+1 numbers: including g and the S numbers to the left?).

                Actually, the interval must include the guess and the two sides. The minimal starting interval must be at least S+1? 

            Let me test:

              We want to leave a segment of at least S numbers. For the '<' case, we leave [L, g-1] of size (g-L). For the '>' case, we leave [g+1, R] of size (R-g).

              We require that the worst-case (the maximum of these two) is at least S.

              How to minimize the total interval? We can set g such that one side is exactly S. Then:

                If we set g = L + S, then the left part is [L, L+S-1] -> size S, the right part is [L+S+1, R] -> which must be non-negative? So the total interval must be at least L to L+S (so the guess is L+S) and then the right part can be empty? Actually, we don't require the right part to be non-empty? We only require that the side we are forced into (which the adversary chooses the larger one) is at least S. But if we set g = L+S, then:
                  left part: [L, L+S-1] -> size S
                  right part: [L+S+1, R] -> if R>=L+S+1 then the right part is at least 1, but if R = L+S, then the right part is empty? Then the adversary would choose the left part? And that is exactly S.

              So the total interval must be at least from L to L+S -> that is S+1 numbers: L, L+1, ..., L+S.

              Therefore, the minimal starting interval is S+1? 

            But wait: the problem says that the adversary will choose the answer that maximizes the remaining interval. So if we have an interval of size X, and we choose a guess g, then the adversary will choose the side that is larger. Therefore, the worst-case interval we are left with is the maximum of the two sides. To guarantee that this maximum is at least S, we require:

                max( g-L, R-g ) >= S

            The minimal X = R-L+1 that can satisfy this for some g is when we set g = L+S. Then the left part has size S (so we have S numbers: from L to L+S-1) and the right part has size (R - (L+S))? We require that the left part is S, and the right part might be 0. Then the worst-case is S. So the minimal X is:

                X = (L+S) - L + 1? Actually, the entire interval must be from L to L+S: that's S+1 numbers.

            So min_size[i] = min_size[i+1] + 1? 

            However, consider if we require the worst-case to be at least min_size[i+1], then the minimal starting interval is min_size[i+1] + 1.

          But wait, the editorial says for non-final answers:

            min_size[i] = min_size[i+1] + 1

          However, the sample: 
            Input: ">>>>>>>>" (8 '>') for N=10, K=9 -> output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9.

          How does that work?

          Precomputation for a string of 8 '>' (M=8):

            min_size[7] = 2 (last step: non-final? Actually, the last character is not '=' so at step 7 we need 2)
            min_size[6] = 3
            min_size[5] = 4
            ... min_size[0] = 9.

          Then the initial interval must be at least 9. N=10, which is >=9 -> valid.

          Then the simulation:

            Step0: L=1, R=10, min_size[0]=9 -> the interval size is 10 (>=9) -> we need to choose a guess such that after the '>' answer, the interval [guess+1, R] has at least min_size[1] = 8.

            How do we choose the guess? The editorial says for '>': 
                high_bound = min( floor((L+R-1)/2), R - min_size[i+1] )
            Actually, the editorial says for '>':
                Compute the upper bound: the guess must be at most ...? 

            Let me read the editorial again:

              For "<":
                low_bound = max( ceil((L+R)/2), L + min_size[i+1] )
                Then guess = low_bound? Actually, the editorial says: "Guess low_bound, update R = guess-1"

              For ">":
                high_bound = min( floor((L+R-1)/2), R - min_size[i+1] )
                Then guess = high_bound, update L = guess+1.

          Why floor((L+R-1)/2)? That would be the midpoint? Actually, we want to leave the larger part to the right? But Theodora will choose the answer that leaves the larger interval. In the case of '>', we are going to leave [guess+1, R]. To force the answer to be '>', we require that the number is greater than the guess, so the guess must be less than the number. But we also want to leave an interval of size at least min_size[i+1] for the next steps.

          Actually, the editorial's method for the adversarial strategy is to choose the guess that minimizes the worst-case interval? But we are reconstructing the guesses. We know the answer Theodora gave, so we can choose a guess that is consistent and also leaves an interval that is at least the required min_size for the next step.

          For a '>' answer at step i:

            After the guess, the next interval is [guess+1, R]. We require that this interval has at least min_size[i+1] numbers? Actually, no: we require that after the split, the interval we are left with (which is [guess+1, R]) must be at least min_size[i+1] in size? Yes.

            Therefore, we require: R - guess >= min_size[i+1]  => guess <= R - min_size[i+1]

            Also, to be consistent with the adversarial strategy: Theodora would have chosen the '>' answer only if the interval [guess+1, R] is at least as large as the interval [L, guess-1]? Actually, she chooses the answer that maximizes the remaining interval. So for the guess to force her to say '>', we must have:

                [guess+1, R] >= [L, guess-1]   (in terms of size) and in case of tie, she would choose '<'? But the problem says: in case of tie, she chooses '<'. Therefore, to force her to say '>', we must have:

                [guess+1, R] > [L, guess-1]

            How do we choose the guess? We want the smallest guess that satisfies:

                R - guess > guess - L   [because then the right part is strictly larger] 
                and also R - guess >= min_size[i+1]

            Actually, we are free to choose any guess that satisfies:

                The guess must be in [L, R] (obviously).

                And to force a '>' answer, we require: (R - guess) > (guess - L)   [because if they are equal, she would choose '<' and we would not get the '>' we have in the string].

            Alternatively, we might have a guess that does not force a tie? Actually, we know the answer is '>', so we must have:

                (R - guess) > (guess - L)   OR if we have a tie? But the problem says: in tie, she chooses '<'. So to get a '>', we must have the right part strictly larger.

          Therefore, we require:

                R - guess > guess - L   =>   guess < (L+R)/2

            And also: guess <= R - min_size[i+1]

          Then we can choose the guess as the maximum possible value that is still less than (L+R)/2 and also <= R - min_size[i+1]. Actually, we want to choose a guess that is as large as possible? But note: we want to leave the interval [guess+1, R] as small as possible? Actually, we don't care as long as it's at least min_size[i+1] and we are consistent.

          Alternatively, we can set:

            guess = min( floor((L+R-1)/2), R - min_size[i+1] )

          Why floor((L+R-1)/2)? Because (L+R)/2 is the midpoint. If we take floor((L+R-1)/2), then:

            Let L=1, R=10: then (1+10-1)/2 = 10/2 = 5 -> then the left part [1,4] has size 4, the right part [6,10] has size 5 -> so right part > left part -> she would say '>'. 

          But what if we set guess = 5? Then:
            left: [1,4] -> 4
            right: [6,10] -> 5 -> so she says '>'.

          However, what if we set guess = 4? Then:
            left: [1,3] -> 3
            right: [5,10] -> 6 -> she says '>'.

          But we want to choose the smallest guess? Actually, we are free to choose any.

          The editorial uses:

            For '>': guess = min( floor((L+R-1)/2), R - min_size[i+1] )

          Why min? Because we are setting an upper bound: we cannot exceed R - min_size[i+1] (to leave at least min_size[i+1] numbers in the right part) and also we cannot exceed floor((L+R-1)/2) to ensure that the right part is larger.

          Similarly, for '<':

            We require: (guess - L) > (R - guess)   to force a '<'? Actually, no: the problem says in tie she chooses '<', so to force a '<' we require that the left part is at least as large as the right part? Actually, no: because if they are equal, she would choose '<'? Then we can get a '<' even if they are equal? 

          But note: the problem says: "Theodora will always answer either ... that maximizes the possible answer range. In the case of tie, she will always answer the first one (<)".

          So if the two intervals are of equal size, she says '<'. Therefore, to get a '<', we require:

                [L, guess-1] >= [guess+1, R]

          And to get a '>' we require:

                [guess+1, R] > [L, guess-1]

          Therefore:

            For '<' at step i:
                We require: (guess - L) >= (R - guess)   [because if equal, she says '<' and that's what we want; if strictly greater, she also says '<' because the left part is larger? Actually, no: if the left part is larger, then the left part is the maximum and she would say '<'.]

                Also, we require: the left part must be at least min_size[i+1]: (guess - L) >= min_size[i+1]

            Then the minimal guess? Actually, we want to minimize the guess? But we are free. We can set:

                guess = max( ceil((L+R)/2), L + min_size[i+1] )

            Why ceil((L+R)/2)? Because then the left part is at least the right part? 

            Example: L=1, R=10: ceil((1+10)/2)=ceil(5.5)=6 -> then left part [1,5] has size 5, right part [7,10] has size 4 -> so she says '<'? Actually, the left part is larger? Then she says '<'. Also, if we set guess=6, the left part is 5 which is >= min_size[i+1] (if min_size[i+1]<=5).

          However, what if we set guess=5? Then left part=4, right part=5 -> she would say '>'. So we must set guess at least 6 to get '<'.

          So the formula for '<':

            guess = max( ceil((L+R)/2.0), L + min_size[i+1] )

          But note: we are dealing with integers. We can compute:

            For '<': 
                low_bound = max( (L+R+1)/2, L + min_size[i+1] )   [because (L+R+1)/2 is the ceiling?]

          Actually, for integers: 
            ceil((L+R)/2) = (L+R+1)/2   when using integer division that truncates? Actually, if we use integer arithmetic:

            We can do: 
                candidate1 = (L+R+1) / 2   [for even and odd: this gives the ceiling?] 
                candidate2 = L + min_size[i+1]

            Then guess = max(candidate1, candidate2)

          Similarly, for '>':

            candidate1 = (L+R) / 2   [floor((L+R)/2)] -> but note: we want floor((L+R-1)/2) in the editorial? Actually, the editorial says: floor((L+R-1)/2). Why?

            Example: L=1, R=10: 
                floor((1+10-1)/2) = (10)/2 = 5 -> then the condition: left part = [1,4] -> size 4, right part = [6,10] -> size 5 -> right part is larger -> she says '>'. But if we set guess=5, then that is valid.

            But if we set guess= floor((L+R)/2) = (1+10)/2 = 5 -> same.

            Actually, floor((L+R-1)/2) is the same as (L+R-1)//2. Why subtract 1? 

            Consider when the total interval is even? 

            Actually, we require that the right part is strictly larger than the left part. With guess = (L+R-1)//2:

                left_size = (guess - L) 
                right_size = (R - guess)

                And we require: right_size > left_size.

            How?

                left_size = ( (L+R-1)//2 - L )
                right_size = R - ( (L+R-1)//2 )

                Then: right_size - left_size = (R - (L+R-1)//2) - ((L+R-1)//2 - L) 
                         = R - L - 2*((L+R-1)//2) + 1? 

            Actually, we can check:

                Let L=1, R=10: (1+10-1)=10, 10//2=5 -> left_size=5-1=4, right_size=10-5=5 -> 5>4 -> good.

                Now, if L=1, R=11: 
                  (1+11-1)=11, 11//2=5 -> left_size=5-1=4, right_size=11-5=6 -> 6>4 -> good.

            But if we set guess = (L+R)//2 = (1+11)//2 = 6? Then:
                left_size = 6-1=5, right_size=11-6=5 -> then she would say '<' (because tie -> she chooses '<').

            So to force a '>' we must have the right part strictly larger, so we set the guess to be strictly less than the midpoint? 

            Therefore, the maximum guess that ensures the right part is strictly larger is floor((L+R-1)/2). Why maximum? Because we also have the constraint: guess <= R - min_size[i+1]. Then we choose the minimum between this candidate and R - min_size[i+1]? Actually, we want the largest possible guess that is <= floor((L+R-1)/2) and <= R - min_size[i+1]? But the editorial says: guess = min(floor((L+R-1)/2), R - min_size[i+1])

            Why min? Because we are setting an upper bound: we cannot exceed R - min_size[i+1] (to leave at least min_size[i+1] in the right part) and we also cannot exceed floor((L+R-1)/2) (to ensure that the right part is strictly larger). Then we take the minimum of these two upper bounds.

          Similarly, for '<':

            We require: guess at least ceil((L+R)/2) to ensure the left part is at least the right part? Actually, to ensure the left part is at least the right part? Then we take:

                candidate1 = (L+R+1)//2   [ceiling of (L+R)/2] 
                candidate2 = L + min_size[i+1]

            Then guess = max(candidate1, candidate2)

          However, what if candidate1 is too high? Actually, we are constrained to have the left part at least min_size[i+1] (so guess must be at least L + min_size[i+1]) and also at least ceil((L+R)/2) to force a '<'. Then we take the maximum of the two.

 3. Steps for simulation:

    Let M = s.length()
    Precompute an array `req` of length M: 
        req[i] = minimal interval size required at step i.

        We do:
          req[M] = 1   // after M steps, we need at least 1 number? Actually, after the last guess, if it's correct, we need 1. But if it's not the last and we have more steps? Actually, we precompute backwards:

          Instead, we can compute backwards:

          Let dp[i] = minimal interval size required at the beginning of step i (so that the answers from i to the end are possible).

          Initialize: 
            dp[M] = 1   // after the last guess, we have no more guesses? Actually, we have M steps. After step M-1, we are done. So we can define:

          We traverse i from M-1 down to 0:

            if s[i] == '=':
                dp[i] = 1   // because we must have a singleton? But then the next step? Actually, after an '=', the game stops. So we don't have a next step. But we must have exactly one number at the moment of the guess.

            else: // '<' or '>'
                // we are going to split the interval. The worst-case branch must have at least dp[i+1] numbers? Actually, we require that the worst-case branch (the one that the adversary leaves) must be at least dp[i+1] in size.

                // The minimal starting interval that can leave a worst-case branch of at least dp[i+1] is: 
                //   dp[i] = dp[i+1] + 1   ??? 

                But wait: we know that the worst-case branch (the larger one) must have at least dp[i+1]. How much starting interval do we need? At least 2 * dp[i+1]? 

                Actually, we can use:

                  dp[i] = 2 * dp[i+1] + 1   ??? -> no, that would be exponential.

                Alternatively, we can use:

                  dp[i] = dp[i+1] + 1   // as in the editorial? 

                But the sample: 
                  M=1: if s[0] is '<' or '>', then dp[0]=2? Then for M=2: 
                      dp[1] = 2 (for the last step) and then dp[0] = 2+1=3.

                Then for the entire string of 8 '>', dp[0] = 9? Then we require the initial interval to be at least 9 -> which matches.

                Why is this linear? Actually, because the minimal interval required for j non-final steps is j+1? 

                Actually, let me check:

                  Step j: we need an interval of size j+1? Then we guess one number, and then we are left with an interval of size j? Then we can do the next step.

                So it is linear: dp[i] = dp[i+1] + 1 for non-final steps.

                However, what if the step is the last one and it is non-final? Then we set dp[M-1]=2. Then dp[M-2] = 3, etc.

                But what about when we have an '=' in the middle? Actually, the problem says that the last character must be '=' OR the entire string is non-equal of length K.

                So we traverse backwards:

                  Let dp[i] be defined for i from M-1 down to 0.

                  if i == M-1:
                    if s[i]=='=': dp[i] = 1
                    else: dp[i] = 2   // because we need at least 2 numbers: one for the guess and one for the remaining number.

                  else:
                    if s[i]=='=': 
                      // this is impossible? because the problem says the last character is '='. So we shouldn't see an '=' in the middle? Actually, the problem states: 
                      //   "The last character of the string is `=` and each character of the string other than the last character is either `<` or `>`" 
                      // So if we see an '=' and it is not the last, then the input is invalid? But we are given the string. Actually, the input is valid by the problem statement.

                    Therefore, we don't get an '=' in the middle? So we only consider the case when the last character is '=' and the rest are '<' or '>'. 

                Actually, the problem says:

                  The string is either:
                    - ends with '=' and the rest are '<' or '>', and the length <= K, OR
                    - the entire string is of length K and each is '<' or '>'.

                So when we are in the step i (which is not the last) and s[i]=='=', then that is impossible? Actually, we don't get that: the last character is the only one that can be '='.

                Therefore, in our precomputation, we only have an '=' at the last step.

                So algorithm for precomputation:

                  Let M = s.length()
                  dp[M] = 1   // after the last step, we don't need any numbers? Actually, we set dp[i] for the step i: the minimal interval size at the start of step i.

                  Then we go backwards from i=M-1 down to 0:

                    if i==M-1 and s[i]=='=': 
                         dp[i] = 1
                    else if i==M-1 and (s[i]=='<' or '>'): 
                         dp[i] = 2
                    else:   // i is not the last and s[i] is '<' or '>'
                         dp[i] = dp[i+1] + 1

                But wait: what if the last character is '=' but the step we are at is not the last? Actually, the last character is at index M-1. So for i from M-2 down to 0, we have non-final steps? Then we do:

                  dp[i] = dp[i+1] + 1

                However, what if the last character is '=' and we are at step i (which is not the last) and the next step is not the last? Then we do:

                  dp[i] = dp[i+1] + 1

                Then when we get to the step i where the next step is the last (and that step is '='), then dp[i] = dp[i+1] + 1 = 1+1 = 2.

          Then we simulate:

            L = 1, R = N
            For i in range(M):
                if R-L+1 < dp[i]:   // the current interval is too small -> output -1
                if s[i]=='=':
                    if L != R:   // we must have a singleton? 
                         return -1
                    else:
                         guess = L   // or R
                         and then we break? but note: the game ends. So we output the guess and then stop.

                else if s[i]=='<':
                    // We require: 
                    //   candidate1 = ceil((L+R)/2) = (L+R+1)/2   [using integer arithmetic: (L+R+1)/2 might be fractional? We do integer division? But L and R are integers, and we want integer floor? Actually, we can do: (L+R+1) >> 1?]
                    //   candidate2 = L + dp[i+1]   // because the left part must be at least dp[i+1]? Actually, the left part is [L, guess-1] and we require that the size of that interval is at least dp[i+1]? 
                    //   Then guess = max(candidate1, candidate2)

                    // But note: we must also ensure that the guess is in [L, R] and that the left part is at least the right part? 

                    // However, what if candidate1 is beyond R? Then we have to use candidate2? But candidate2 might be too high? 

                    // Actually, we require that the guess is at least max(candidate1, candidate2) and at most R? 

                    // How about if max(candidate1, candidate2) > R? then it's impossible.

                    guess = max( (L+R+1) / 2, L + dp[i+1] )   // integer division: (L+R+1) might be even?

                    // But note: (L+R+1)/2 might not be integer? Then we do integer division? Actually, we can use:

                         candidate1 = (L+R+1) >> 1;   // integer division: this is the ceiling for integers? Actually, for integers: 
                         ceil((L+R)/2) = (L+R+1)/2 when using integer division? 

                    // However, if (L+R) is even: 
                         (L+R+1)/2 = (even+1)/2 -> integer? 
                         If (L+R) is odd: (odd+1)/2 -> integer.

                    Then if guess > R: return -1

                    // Also, we must ensure that the left part is at least the right part? 
                    // But by setting guess to at least (L+R+1)/2, we have:
                         left_size = guess - L
                         right_size = R - guess
                         and we require: left_size >= right_size.

                    Then we update: R = guess - 1

                else if s[i]=='>':
                    candidate1 = (L+R) >> 1;   // but wait, we want floor((L+R-1)/2) -> (L+R-1) // 2? 

                    Actually, we want: 
                         candidate1 = (L+R-1) / 2   [integer division?]

                    candidate2 = R - dp[i+1]   // because the right part must be at least dp[i+1]? 

                    Then guess = min(candidate1, candidate2)

                    If guess < L: return -1

                    Then update: L = guess + 1

          However, note: the sample input ">>>>>>>>" (8 '>') for N=10, K=9:

            Precomputation: 
                M=8
                dp[7]=2
                dp[6]=3
                dp[5]=4
                dp[4]=5
                dp[3]=6
                dp[2]=7
                dp[1]=8
                dp[0]=9

            Step0: L=1, R=10, s[0]='>'? Actually the first character in the sample string is '>', then we do:

                candidate1 = (1+10-1)/2 = (10)/2 = 5
                candidate2 = R - dp[1] = 10 - 8 = 2
                Then guess = min(5,2)=2 -> but the sample output starts with 1? Actually, the sample output is: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9.

            Why 1? Actually the sample input is ">>>>>>>>" (8 times) and the output is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9.

            How does that work?

            Step0: guess=1 -> then Theodora answers '>' (as per the string) -> so the number is greater than 1 -> then the interval becomes [2,10]. 

            Why did we choose 1? Because we are free to choose any guess that is consistent? But our formula for the first step:

                candidate1 = (1+10-1)/2 = 5 -> but we set guess = min(5, 10-8)=min(5,2)=2.

            How can we choose 1? 

            Conditions for the first guess (s[0]=='>'):

                We must choose a guess g such that:
                  (1) Theodora would answer '>' -> meaning that the right part (g+1 to 10) is strictly larger than the left part (1 to g-1). 
                  (2) The right part must be at least dp[1]=8.

            Condition (2): 10 - g >= 8 -> g <= 2.

            Condition (1): (10 - g) > (g - 1)  => 10 - g > g - 1  => 11 > 2g  => g < 5.5 -> so g<=5.

            Then we can choose g=1 or 2? 

            Why choose 1? Because the problem says we can output any sequence? Then we can choose 1? But our formula chose 2.

            Why not choose 1? 

            Condition (1): 
                left part: [1,0] -> size 0? 
                right part: [2,10] -> size 9 -> 9>0 -> so she would say '>'.

            Condition (2): the right part has 9 which is >=8 -> so it's valid.

            Therefore, we can choose 1.

            How to allow 1? 

            The formula for '>':

                candidate1 = (L+R-1)/2 -> which is the maximum guess that ensures the right part is strictly larger? Actually, we can choose any guess that is at most (L+R-1)/2 and also at most R - dp[i+1]. Then we can choose the smallest possible guess? But the formula for candidate1 gives an upper bound, and then we take the minimum of candidate1 and candidate2? 

            Actually, we are taking the minimum of candidate1 and candidate2? Then we get the smallest of the two? But we want the largest? 

            Why? Because we want to leave the right part as large as possible? Actually, we don't care. We can choose any guess in the valid range.

            However, the problem: we are free to choose any guess that is in [L, R] and satisfies:

                For '>': 
                  (R - g) > (g - L)   and   (R - g) >= dp[i+1]

            The valid g must be:

                g <= (L+R-1)/2   [so that the right part is larger] and g <= R - dp[i+1]

            Then we can choose any g in [L, min( (L+R-1)/2, R-dp[i+1] )]? 

            But note: the left part must be nonnegative? Actually, g must be at least L. 

            Why not choose the smallest? Then g = L? 

            Then the update: L = g+1 -> becomes L+1, which is the next number.

            And then we can continue.

            Therefore, we can choose the smallest possible? 

            However, the sample output chooses 1, then 2, then 3, ... then 9. 

            How about we choose the smallest possible? 

            For '>' at step i: 
                guess = L   (if L <= min( (L+R-1)//2, R - dp[i+1] ))

            Then update: L = L+1.

            Similarly, for '<' we could choose the largest possible? 

            But the editorial says for '<': guess = max( ceil((L+R)/2), L+dp[i+1] ) -> which is the largest? Actually, it is the minimal guess that satisfies the conditions? 

            Actually, we require the guess to be at least a lower bound. Then we can choose the lower bound as the guess.

            So we can set:

                For '<': 
                    low_bound = max( (L+R+1)/2, L+dp[i+1] )
                    Then we choose low_bound? 

                For '>': 
                    high_bound = min( (L+R-1)/2, R - dp[i+1] )
                    Then we choose the smallest possible? Actually, no: we must also satisfy the condition that the right part is strictly larger? 

                    But note: if we choose a guess that is less than high_bound, then the condition (right part > left part) is still satisfied? 

                    Actually, the condition: (R - g) > (g - L)  <=> g < (L+R)/2.

                    Since (L+R-1)/2 = floor((L+R-1)/2) <= (L+R)/2 - 0.5? 

                    So if g is <= (L+R-1)/2, then g < (L+R)/2 -> condition satisfied.

            Therefore, we can choose any guess in the range [L, high_bound]? 

            However, we also require that the right part has at least dp[i+1] numbers: R - g >= dp[i+1] -> g <= R - dp[i+1]. But we already set high_bound = min( (L+R-1)/2, R - dp[i+1] ), so any guess in [L, high_bound] satisfies both.

            Why not choose the smallest? Then we choose L.

            Similarly, for '<': we can choose any guess in [low_bound, R]? Then we choose low_bound.

          Then the simulation for the sample:

            Step0: 
                s[0] = '>'
                L=1, R=10
                dp[0]=9 -> we need at least 9? Then the interval is 10>=9 -> valid.
                high_bound = min( (1+10-1)/2, 10 - dp[1] ) = min(10/2=5, 10-8=2) = 2.
                Then we choose the smallest in [1,2]? -> 1.

                Then update: L = 1+1 = 2.

            Step1:
                s[1] = '>' (the next character in ">>>>>>>>" is the second '>')
                L=2, R=10
                dp[1]=8 -> interval size=9>=8 -> valid.
                high_bound = min( (2+10-1)/2 = (11)/2=5, 10 - dp[2]=10-7=3) = min(5,3)=3.
                Then we choose 2? (the smallest in [2,3]) -> 2.

                Then update: L=3.

            Step2: 
                s[2]='>', L=3, R=10
                high_bound = min((3+10-1)/2 = (12)/2=6, 10 - dp[3]=10-6=4) = 4.
                guess = 3 -> then update: L=4.

            Step3: 
                s[3]='>', L=4, R=10
                high_bound = min((4+10-1)/2 = (13)/2=6 (integer division: 6), 10 - dp[4]=10-5=5) = 5.
                guess=4 -> update: L=5.

            Step4: 
                s[4]='>', L=5, R=10
                high_bound = min((5+10-1)/2 = (14)/2=7, 10 - dp[5]=10-4=6) = 6.
                guess=5 -> update: L=6.

            Step5:
                s[5]='>', L=6, R=10
                high_bound = min((6+10-1)/2 = (15)/2=7 (integer division: 7), 10 - dp[6]=10-3=7) = 7.
                guess=6 -> update: L=7.

            Step6:
                s[6]='>', L=7, R=10
                high_bound = min((7+10-1)/2 = (16)/2=8, 10 - dp[7]=10-2=8) = 8.
                guess=7 -> update: L=8.

            Step7:
                s[7]='>', L=8, R=10
                high_bound = min((8+10-1)/2 = (17)/2=8 (integer division: 8), 10 - dp[8] -> wait, we have dp[8]? 

                Actually, we precomputed dp for indices 0..7. We have:

                  dp[7]=2, then for step7: 
                    dp[8] is not defined? 

                We defined:
                  dp[i] for i from 0 to M-1? and we set dp[M]=1.

                Then for step i, we use dp[i+1] for the next step? 

                Step7: i=7, then we need dp[8]? 

                How did we precompute?

                  Let M=8 -> we have answers at indices 0 to 7.

                  We set dp[8]=1.

                  Then for i=7: 
                      if s[7]=='<', or '>' -> then dp[7] = dp[8] + 1 = 2.

                  Then for step7: 
                    dp[8] is 1.

                Then for step7 (i=7): 
                    candidate1 = (8+10-1)/2 = (17)/2 = 8
                    candidate2 = 10 - dp[8] = 10 - 1 = 9
                    Then high_bound = min(8,9)=8.

                    Then we can choose 8? 

                    Then update: L = 8+1 = 9.

                Then we output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] -> but the sample output has 9 guesses? 

                Actually, the sample output has 9 numbers: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9.

            How do we get 9? 

            Note: the problem says the game ends when the correct guess is made or after K wrong guesses. The sample input has K=9 and the string of 8 '>', meaning that the last guess (the 9th) is not provided? Actually, the string has 8 characters? Then we have 8 guesses? 

            But the sample output has 9 guesses? 

            Actually, the sample input: 
                "10 9
                 >>>>>>>>>" -> wait, the sample input says:
                Input: 
                  10 5
                  ><>=   -> output 4 numbers.

                Then the next sample: 
                  10 5
                  ><<><   -> output 5 numbers.

                Then:
                  10 5
                  <>=   -> output -1.

                Then:
                  10 9
                  >>>>>>>>   -> output 9 numbers: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9.

                And the last sample:
                  10 10
                  >>>>>>>>>>   -> output -1.

            So the string length M is 8 for the fourth sample? Then we are to output 8 guesses? But the output has 9 numbers? 

            Actually, the problem says: the output contains M integers, where M is the length of the string.

            The fourth sample input: 
               10 9
               >>>>>>>>   -> 8 characters.

            Then we output 8 numbers? But the sample output is 9 numbers: 1 to 9? 

            Correction: the sample input says: 
                Input: "10 9
                        >>>>>>>>"

            Output: "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9"

            This is 9 numbers? 

            Actually, the string has 8 characters, so we should output 8 numbers? 

            But the problem says: the output contains M integers (M = length of the string). 

            The sample output has 9 numbers? 

            This is a discrepancy. 

            Looking at the sample: 
                ">>>>>>>>" has 8 characters.

            Then the output should be 8 numbers.

            However, the sample output is 9 numbers? 

            Actually, I see the sample input says ">>>>>>>>" (8 characters) and the output is 9 numbers? 

            This must be a mistake. The sample input is:

                "10 9
                 >>>>>>>>"

            And the output is:

                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

            But note: the problem says: 
                "The output for Sample Input: 
                 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9"

            However, the sample input has 8 characters, so we should output 8 guesses. 

            How can we output 8 guesses? 

            The sample output has 9 numbers? 

            I see: the sample input has K=9, but the string is 8 characters. Then the game ends after 8 guesses? But the problem says the game ends when the correct guess is made or after K wrong guesses. Since K=9, we haven't used all guesses? 

            Actually, the problem says: 
                Theodora's answer for each guess.

            And the input: the second line is a string of answers.

            The sample input has a string of 8 answers. That means Romanos made 8 guesses? Then we must output 8 guesses.

            But the sample output has 9 numbers? 

            This is confusing.

            After checking the problem statement:

              "The second line contains a string in a line denoting Theodora's answers."

              and the output: "the output contains M integers: A1 ... AM in a line"

              M = length of the string.

            Therefore, for the sample input with 8 answers, we output 8 guesses.

            So the sample output "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9" has 9 numbers, which is wrong.

            Actually, the sample input says:

                Input: 
                  10 9
                  >>>>>>>>   (8 characters)

                Output: 
                  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   (9 numbers)

            This must be a typo? 

            Alternatively, the sample input has 9 '>'? 

            The problem says: 
                Sample Input: 
                  10 9
                  >>>>>>>>

            How many '>'? 8.

            Then the sample output is 9 numbers? 

            I see the sample input "10 5" and "><>=" -> output 4 numbers: 5 8 6 7.

            Therefore, the fourth sample input should output 8 numbers.

            How about the sample output is: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8? 

            Then the next guess would be 9? but we don't output the 9th because the game ended? 

            But the problem says: the game ends after the 8th guess (because we didn't get an '=') and we used 8 guesses (which is less than or equal to K=9) -> then Romanos loses? 

            Then the output is 8 numbers: 1,2,...,8.

            But the problem statement says: 
                "Output for Sample Input: 
                 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9"

            This is inconsistent.

            Let me check the sample input in the problem statement:

                "10 9
                 >>>>>>>>"

            Then the sample output is: 
                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

            This implies that the string of answers has 9 characters? 

            Actually, the problem says: the string can be either:
              - ends with '=' and the rest are '<' or '>', and length <= K, OR
              - the entire string is of length K and each character is '<' or '>'.

            In the fourth sample, K=9, and the string is entirely '<' or '>' and of length 9? 

            Therefore, the sample input has 9 '>'? 

            The problem says: 
                "Sample Input:
                 10 9
                 >>>>>>>>"

            That's 8 '>'. 

            But the output has 9 numbers, which implies 9 guesses -> 9 answers? 

            So the sample input should have 9 characters? 

            I think there was a typo: the sample input has 8 '>' but it should be 9.

            How to confirm? 

            The fifth sample input:

                "10 10
                 >>>>>>>>>>"

            Then the output is -1.

            And we output 10 guesses? 

            But the problem says: the string length is exactly K (10) and we output 10 numbers? 

            However, the problem output is -1.

            Therefore, we must design:

              Precomputation for the fourth sample (9 '>', K=9, N=10):

                M = 9
                dp[8] = 2   (last step: non-final? Actually, the last character is '>' -> non-final, so dp[8]=2)
                dp[7] = 3
                dp[6] = 4
                dp[5] = 5
                dp[4] = 6
                dp[3] = 7
                dp[2] = 8
                dp[1] = 9
                dp[0] = 10

                Then step0: 
                   L=1, R=10, dp[0]=10 -> the interval is 10, so valid.
                   s[0]='>': 
                         candidate1 = (1+10-1)/2 = 10/2=5
                         candidate2 = 10 - dp[1] = 10 - 9 = 1
                         guess = min(5,1)=1.

                Then update L=2.

                Step1: 
                   candidate1 = (2+10-1)/2 = 11/2 = 5
                   candidate2 = 10 - dp[2] = 10-8=2
                   guess = min(5,2)=2.

                ... until step8: 
                   step8: i=8, L=9, R=10
                         candidate1 = (9+10-1)/2 = 18/2=9
                         candidate2 = 10 - dp[9] -> but we have dp[9]? 

                How we precomputed: 
                  We defined dp[9] = 1? (because we set dp[M] = 1, and M=9, so dp[9] is defined as 1)

                Then candidate2 = 10 - dp[9] = 9.
                Then guess = min(9,9)=9.

                Then update: L = 9+1 = 10.

                Then the guesses: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] -> 9 numbers.

            Then the fifth sample: 
                M=10
                dp[9]=2   (last character is non-final? so dp[9]=2)
                dp[8]=3
                ... dp[0]=11.

                Then step0: L=1, R=10 -> interval size=10 < dp[0]=11 -> output -1.

            So the sample outputs are consistent.

            Therefore, the fourth sample input has 9 '>' (so the string is 9 characters long). 

            But the problem statement writes: ">>>>>>>>" (which is 8) for the fourth sample? 

            This is likely a typo. We assume the input string length is M.

          Implementation:

            Steps:

              Read N, K.
              Read the string s. Let M = s.length().

              Precompute an array dp of length M+1.
                 dp[M] = 1   // base: after the last guess, we require 1 number? Actually, we don't make a guess then, but we require that the interval at the next step (which doesn't exist) is at least 1? Actually, the base is for after the last guess: we don't require any number? 

                 But the recurrence: 
                    For i from M-1 down to 0:
                      if s[i]=='=': 
                         // This must be the last character? Actually, the problem says the last character is '=' OR the entire string is non-final? 
                         // But if we see an '=' at a non-last position? then it's invalid? 
                         // Actually, the problem states the string either ends with '=' and the rest are non-equal, or the entire string is non-final and of length K.

                 Therefore, we should only see an '=' at the last position? 

                 So: if i==M-1 and s[i]=='=': 
                         dp[i] = 1
                 else if i==M-1 and (s[i]=='<' or '>'): 
                         dp[i] = 2
                 else:   // i is not the last, and s[i] is '<' or '>'
                         dp[i] = dp[i+1] + 1

                 But what if we see an '=' at a non-last position? Then the problem says the input is valid? Actually, the problem says: 
                    "either:
                      - the last character of the string is `=` and ... 
                      - or ..."

                 So if we see an '=' at a non-last position, then it's invalid? But the problem says we are given the string. Then we have to check: 

                 Actually, we can do:

                    If the last character is '=' and there is an '=' in the middle -> then it's invalid? 

                 However, the problem says: the last character is the only one that can be '='. So we can assume that if the string has an '=', then it must be the last character.

                 Therefore, if we find an '=' at a non-last position, we output -1? 

                 But the problem says: the input satisfies the conditions. So we don't need to check? 

                 Let me re-read: the input is either:
                   - the last character is '=' and the rest are '<' or '>', and the length M <= K, OR
                   - the entire string is of length K and each character is '<' or '>'.

                 So we can check: 
                   if the string contains an '=' that is not the last character -> then it's invalid? 

                 But the problem says: "each character of the string other than the last character is either '<' or '>'" -> so the last character is the only one that can be '='.

                 Therefore, we can assume the input is valid.

              Then simulation:

                 L = 1, R = N
                 guesses = vector<long long>()

                 for i from 0 to M-1:
                    if R < L: then it's impossible -> output -1 and return.

                    // Check the current interval size
                    if (R - L + 1) < dp[i]:
                         output -1 and return.

                    if s[i]=='=':
                         if L != R:   // we must have a singleton
                             output -1 and return
                         else:
                             guesses.push_back(L)
                             // and we break? but note: the game ends. We don't update the interval? We just output the guess and break.
                             // But we still have to break the loop? 
                             // And then output the guesses.

                    else if s[i]=='<':
                         // Compute candidate1 = ceil((L+R)/2) = (L+R+1)/2   [integer: (L+R+1) // 2]
                         // candidate2 = L + dp[i+1]   // the left part must be at least dp[i+1] numbers? 
                         guess_val = max( (L+R+1) / 2, L + dp[i+1] )

                         // But note: if we use integer division for large integers? We do: 
                             candidate1 = (L+R+1) / 2;   // when L and R are integers, and we use integer division? Actually, we can do: 
                             candidate1 = (L+R+1) >> 1;   // but for big integers, we can do: (L+R+1) / 2 using integer arithmetic? 

                         However, note: L and R can be up to 10^18, so we do:

                         candidate1 = (L+R+1) / 2;   // integer division truncates? But (L+R+1) might be even? Actually, we want floor((L+R+1)/2) which is the same as (L+R+1)/2 in integer division for positive.

                         But if (L+R+1) is odd? Then integer division truncates, but that is the floor? But we want the ceiling of (L+R)/2? 

                         Actually: 
                            ceil((L+R)/2) = (L+R+1) // 2   in integer division.

                         Then guess_val = max(candidate1, candidate2)

                         // Check if guess_val is in [L, R]? 
                         But we also must ensure that the left part is at least the right part? 

                         However, by setting guess_val = max(candidate1, candidate2), we have:

                            candidate1 is at least ceil((L+R)/2) -> then the left part (from L to guess_val-1) is at least the right part (from guess_val+1 to R) -> so Theodora would say '<'? (because the left part is at least as large as the right part, and in tie she says '<').

                         But what if candidate2 is larger than candidate1? Then we set guess_val = candidate2.

                         Then we must check: is the left part at least the right part? 
                            left_size = guess_val - L
                            right_size = R - guess_val
                            we require left_size >= right_size? 

                         But by setting candidate1 = ceil((L+R)/2), we know that if we choose candidate1 then the condition holds. But if we choose candidate2 (which is larger than candidate1) then:

                            candidate2 = L + dp[i+1] -> which might be greater than ceil((L+R)/2). Then left_size = candidate2 - L = dp[i+1] (which is at least 1) and right_size = R - candidate2.

                         But we don't know if left_size >= right_size? 

                         Actually, we require left_size >= right_size to force a '<'. 

                         Therefore, we must ensure that candidate2 is chosen only if it forces a '<'. 

                         Condition: candidate2 - L >= R - candidate2   => candidate2 >= (L+R+1)/2? 

                         But we set guess_val = max( candidate1, candidate2 ) and candidate1 = (L+R+1)/2. Then candidate2 is at least candidate1? So the condition holds.

                         Therefore, it is safe.

                         Then we push guess_val.

                         Then update: R = guess_val - 1

                    else if s[i]=='>':
                         candidate1 = (L+R-1) / 2   // floor((L+R-1)/2)
                         candidate2 = R - dp[i+1]   // the right part must be at least dp[i+1] numbers.

                         guess_val = min(candidate1, candidate2)

                         // Check: to force a '>' we require that the right part is strictly larger than the left part? 
                         //   Condition: R - guess_val > guess_val - L   -> which is satisfied if guess_val <= (L+R-1)/2.

                         // Also, by setting guess_val = min(candidate1, candidate2), we have:
                         //   if candidate1 is the minimum, then we are within the bound for the condition.
                         //   if candidate2 is the minimum, then we are also within the bound? Because candidate2 <= candidate1 = (L+R-1)/2.

                         Then push guess_val.

                         Then update: L = guess_val + 1

                 Then after the loop, output the guesses.

          But note: for the last step when s[i]=='=' we break the loop? Actually, we continue until the last guess? 

          However, after an '=', the game ends. So we don't update the interval? And we break the loop? Actually, we don't break the loop, we just do that step and then we are done? 

          But the problem: the string has exactly M characters. We are processing each character. After we push the last guess (for the '=') we then stop the loop? 

          Actually, we process all M characters. The '=' might be the last character? Then we process it and then the loop ends.

          However, after an '=', the next step doesn't happen? But our dp[i+1] for the step that is the last (with '=') is computed? 

          For the last step (i=M-1) with '=':

             We do:
                 if (R-L+1) < dp[M-1] (which is 1) -> then if the interval is not a singleton, output -1.

                 Then push L (or R) as the guess.

          Then we don't update the interval? Because the game ends.

          But note: we don't use the interval for the next step? 

          So we don't update the interval after an '='? 

          However, the problem says: after a correct guess, the game ends. So we don't need to update the interval? 

          Therefore, we can do:

            if s[i]=='=': 
                if L != R: return -1
                else: 
                    guesses.push_back(L);
                    // and we do nothing to L,R? and then we break? Actually, we continue to the next step? But i is the last step.

          So we don't break.

          But what if there are more steps? Actually, the last step must be the last character? 

          Since M is the length, we process all M steps.

          One more issue: integer division for large integers? 

          We are using: 
             candidate1 for '<' = (L+R+1) / 2   -> for integers, we can do: 
                 if (L+R+1) is even? Then it's an integer. Otherwise, integer division truncates? 

          Actually, we want the floor of (L+R+1)/2? But that is the same as (L+R+1) divided by 2 using integer division? 

          Similarly, candidate1 for '>' = (L+R-1) / 2.

          But note: (L+R+1) and (L+R-1) might be negative? The numbers are positive (1 to N).

          Therefore, we can safely use integer division.

          Code structure:

          But wait: the sample input "10 5" and "><>=":

            M=4
            Precompute dp:
                dp[4]=1
                i=3: s[3]='=' -> dp[3]=1
                i=2: s[2]='>' -> dp[2]= dp[3]+1 = 2   (because i=2 is not the last step? Actually, i=2 is the third step, and the last step is at i=3) -> so non-final: dp[2]=2
                i=1: s[1]='<' -> dp[1]=3
                i=0: s[0]='>' -> dp[0]=4

            Simulation:

                Step0: L=1, R=10, s[0]='>'
                    candidate1 = (1+10-1)/2 = 10/2=5
                    candidate2 = 10 - dp[1] = 10-3=7
                    guess_val = min(5,7)=5.

                Step1: L = 5+1 = 6, R=10 -> [6,10]
                    s[1]='<'
                    candidate1 = (6+10+1)/2 = 17/2 = 8
                    candidate2 = 6 + dp[2] = 6+2=8
                    guess_val = max(8,8)=8.

                Step2: update R = 8-1 = 7 -> [6,7]
                    s[2]='>'
                    candidate1 = (6+7-1)/2 = 12/2=6
                    candidate2 = 7 - dp[3] = 7-1=6
                    guess_val = min(6,6)=6.

                Step3: update L = 6+1 = 7 -> [7,7]
                    s[3]='=' -> push 7.

                Then output: 5,8,6,7 -> matches the sample.

          Therefore, we write the code accordingly.

          One more sample: 
                Input: "10 5
                        ><<><"

            M=5, dp:
                dp[5]=1 -> base
                i=4: s[4]='<' -> non-final? and not last? -> but it is the last step? -> no, because M=5 and i=4 is the last index? 
                    Then: because the last character is not '=' (the entire string is non-final) -> then we set: 
                    if i==M-1 -> true, then dp[4]=2.
                i=3: s[3]='>' -> dp[3]=3
                i=2: s[2]='<' -> dp[2]=4
                i=1: s[1]='<' -> dp[1]=5
                i=0: s[0]='>' -> dp[0]=6

            Step0: L=1, R=10, s[0]='>'
                candidate1 = (1+10-1)/2=5
                candidate2 = 10 - dp[1] = 10-5=5
                guess_val=min(5,5)=5? 

            But the sample output starts with 4.

            How to get 4?

            Conditions for step0: 
                We require: 
                  (1) Theodora would say '>' -> so the right part must be strictly larger: 10 - guess > guess - 1 -> guess < 5.5 -> so guess<=5.
                  (2) The right part must be at least dp[1]=5 -> 10 - guess >=5 -> guess<=5.

                Then we can choose any guess in [1,5]. The smallest is 1? The largest is 5? 

            But the sample output chooses 4? 

            Why 4? 

            The sample output: 4 10 8 5 7

            Step0: guess=4 -> 
                Theodora: 
                  left: [1,3] -> size 3
                  right: [5,10] -> size 6 -> so she says '>', which matches.

            Why didn't we choose 4? 

            Our formula for '>': 
                candidate1 = (L+R-1)/2 = (1+10-1)/2=5
                candidate2 = 10 - dp[1] = 10-5=5
                then guess_val = min(5,5)=5.

            But we can choose any guess in [1,5]. The problem says: we can output any.

            How to allow 4? 

            The editorial says: we may output any.

            Therefore, we can change: 

                For '>': we can choose any guess in [L, min(candidate1, candidate2)]? 

                But we chose the smallest? Actually, we set guess_val = min(candidate1, candidate2) -> which is 5? 

            But the sample output chooses 4.

            We are free to choose any value in the range [L, min(candidate1, candidate2)]? 

            Actually, the constraints are:

                guess must be in [L, R] (obviously)

                and for '>': 
                    guess <= (L+R-1)/2   [to ensure the right part is strictly larger] 
                    and guess <= R - dp[i+1]   [to ensure the right part is at least dp[i+1]]

            Then we can choose any value in [L, min(candidate1, candidate2)].

            Similarly, for '<' we can choose any value in [max(candidate1, candidate2), R]? 

            Then we can choose:

                For '>': the smallest? But the sample output chooses 4 which is not the smallest? 

            Actually, the sample output for the first guess is 4, which is in [1,5]? 

            How about we choose the smallest? Then we choose 1? 

            Then the next step: 
                L=2, R=10 -> then the next answer is '<'? 

            But the sample output's next guess is 10? 

            How to get 10? 

            Step1: s[1]='<', L=2, R=10
                candidate1 = (2+10+1)/2 = 13/2=6
                candidate2 = 2 + dp[2] = 2+4=6
                then guess_val = max(6,6)=6.

            But the sample output guesses 10? 

            Conditions for step1 (s[1]='<'):

                We require: 
                  left part (2 to guess-1) >= right part (guess+1 to 10) -> to force '<'
                  and the left part must be at least dp[2]=4.

                How to choose 10? 

                Then the left part: [2,9] -> size 8, right part: [11,10] -> size 0? 
                Then Theodora would say '<'? 

                But also the left part must be at least 4 -> 8>=4 -> valid.

                And the condition: 8>=0 -> true.

                But how to compute the candidate? 

                  candidate1 = ceil((2+10)/2)= (12+1)/2=6? 
                  candidate2 = 2 + 4 = 6.

                Then we set guess_val = max(6,6)=6.

                But we can choose any guess in [max(6,6), 10] = [6,10]? 

                Then we can choose 10? 

            Therefore, we can change our method: 

                For '<': we can choose any guess in [max(candidate1, candidate2), R]? 
                For '>': we can choose any guess in [L, min(candidate1, candidate2)]? 

            But the problem says we may output any.

            However, the editorial says to choose:

                For '<': max(candidate1, candidate2)
                For '>': min(candidate1, candidate2)

            But we can choose any? 

            To be safe and efficient, we can choose the minimal for '>' and the maximal for '<'? But the sample output for the first step is 4 (which is not the minimal) and for the second step is 10 (which is the maximal).

            Why not let the user choose? Actually, we must output one possible scenario.

            How about we choose:

                For '>': choose the smallest? -> 1? 
                Then the next step: 
                   L=2, R=10, then we have to choose 6? 
                Then the guesses: 1, 6, ... 

            But the sample output is 4,10,8,5,7.

            How to reconstruct 4,10,8,5,7? 

            Step0: 
                L=1, R=10, s[0]='>', so we choose 4? 
                Conditions: 
                  4 is in [1,5]? -> yes.

            Step1:
                L=5, R=10? -> no, because the answer was '>', so the number is greater than 4 -> so the new interval is [5,10].
                Then s[1]='<': we choose 10? 
                Conditions:
                  To force '<': the left part [5,9] -> size 5, right part: [] -> size 0 -> then she says '<'? 
                  and the left part must be at least dp[2]=4 -> 5>=4 -> valid.
                Then update: R = 10-1=9.

            Step2:
                L=5, R=9, s[2]='<' -> we choose 8? 
                Conditions:
                  candidate1 = ceil((5+9)/2)= (14+1)/2=7 -> then we require guess at least 7? 
                  candidate2 = 5 + dp[3] = 5+3=8 -> then we require at least 8.
                  So we choose 8? 
                Then update: R=8-1=7.

            Step3:
                L=5, R=7, s[3]='>' -> we choose 5? 
                Conditions: 
                  candidate1 = (5+7-1)/2 = 11/2=5
                  candidate2 = 7 - dp[4] = 7-2=5
                  Then we can choose any in [5,5] -> 5.

                Then update: L=5+1=6.

            Step4:
                L=6, R=7, s[4]='<' -> we choose 7? 
                But wait: the answer is '<'? 
                Then we require: the number is less than the guess? 
                But the number is in [6,7]? 
                If we guess 7, then:
                  left: [6,6] -> size 1
                  right: [] -> size 0 -> then she says '<'? 
                But the problem says: the number is in [6,7] and we guess 7 -> then the number must be less than 7? -> so the number is 6? 
                Then the next interval is [6,6]? 

                However, we are at step4 (the last) and we update: R=7-1=6.

                Then we output 5 numbers.

            But the problem: the next step? There is no next step. The game ends? 

            However, the sample output has 5 numbers: 4,10,8,5,7.

            How to get 7 at step4? 

            Conditions: 
                Step4: L=6, R=7, s[4]='<' -> we choose 7? 
                Then we require: 
                  left part: [6,6] -> size 1, which must be at least dp[5]? 
                  But dp[5] is defined? 

                Precomputation: 
                  dp[5] = 1? (for step5, which doesn't exist? we set dp[5]=1 for the base) -> then we use dp[5] in step4? 

                candidate2 = L + dp[5] = 6+1=7 -> then we must choose at least 7? 
                candidate1 = ceil((6+7)/2)= (13+1)/2=7 -> then we choose 7.

            Then the update: R=7-1=6.

            Then the next step? There is no next step.

            Therefore, the output is [4,10,8,5,7].

          So to allow any guess, we can choose:

            For '>': we choose L (the smallest) -> but then the sample output 4,10,8,5,7 would not be produced? 

          How about we change the formula to:

            For '>': 
                We can choose any guess in [L, high_bound]? 
                Then why not choose the same as the sample? 

            But the problem says: we may output any.

          Therefore, we can choose the minimal for '>' and the maximal for '<'? 

          Or we can choose arbitrarily? 

          Since the problem says we may output any, we choose:

            For '>': we choose the minimal candidate? L? 
            For '<': we choose the maximal candidate? R? 

          But the sample output for step0 chooses 4 (which is not minimal) and step1 chooses 10 (which is maximal).

          How about we choose:

            For '>': we choose the minimal candidate? L -> then we get 1 for the first step? 
            Then the next step: 
                L=2, R=10 -> then for '<' we choose R=10? 
            Then the guesses: 1,10, then ... 

          Then step2: 
                After step0: guess=1, answer='>' -> [2,10]
                Step1: guess=10, answer='<' -> then the new interval is [2,9]? 
                Then step2: s[2]='<' -> we choose R=9? 
            Then the guesses: 1,10,9, ...

          But the sample output is 4,10,8,5,7.

          Since the problem says we may output any, we can choose arbitrarily? 

          However, we must be consistent and efficient.

          To match the sample outputs? 

          Alternatively, we can choose:

            For '>': choose R - dp[i+1]   (if it is <= candidate1) -> then we choose the largest possible? 

            But the formula for candidate2 is R - dp[i+1] and candidate1 is (L+R-1)/2. Then we set:

                For '>': 
                    if candidate2 <= candidate1: 
                         guess_val = candidate2   // which is the largest possible? 
                    else: 
                         guess_val = candidate1   // which is the largest possible that satisfies the condition? 

            Actually, candidate2 = R - dp[i+1] is the largest guess that leaves the right part exactly dp[i+1]? 

            Similarly, for '<': 
                    candidate2 = L + dp[i+1] is the smallest guess that leaves the left part exactly dp[i+1]? 
                    But we can choose any in [max(candidate1, candidate2), R]? 

            How about we choose candidate2 for both? 

            Then for step0: 
                '>': candidate2 = R - dp[1] = 10-5=5 -> then we choose 5? 
                Then step1: 
                    '<': candidate2 = L + dp[2] = 5+4=9 -> then we choose 9? 
                Then step2: 
                    '<': candidate2 = L + dp[3] = 5+3=8? -> but L is 6? 
                    Actually, step0: guess=5 -> then L=6, R=10? 
                    Then step1: guess=9 -> then the answer is '<'? -> then R=8? 
                    Then step2: L=6, R=8 -> candidate2 = 6+4=10? -> but 10>8 -> then we choose candidate1 = ceil((6+8)/2)=7? 
                    Then we choose 7? 
                Then step3: 
                    s[3]='>' -> candidate2 = R - dp[4] = 8-2=6? -> then we choose 6? 
                Then step4: 
                    s[4]='<' -> candidate2 = L + dp[5] = 7+1=8? -> but L is 7? and R=8? then candidate1 = (7+8+1)/2=8, so we choose 8? 
                Then the guesses: 5,9,7,6,8 -> not the sample.

          Alternatively, we can choose arbitrarily as long as it is in the valid range? 

          To match the sample, we would need to store the sample output? 

          Since the problem says any scenario is acceptable, we can choose the minimal for '>' and the maximal for '<'. 

          But the sample output does not do that.

          However, the problem does not require a specific scenario. We'll choose:

             For '>': choose the minimal candidate: L
             For '<': choose the maximal candidate: R

          Why? Because it is simple and efficient.

          Let me test the fourth sample: 
                Input: 10 9, s = ">>>>>>>>>" (9 times)

            Step0: 
                '>': choose L=1 -> update L=2
            Step1:
                '>': choose L=2 -> update L=3
            ... until step8: 
                choose L=9 -> update L=10.

            Then the guesses: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 -> matches the sample output.

          And the fifth sample: 
                Input: 10 10, s = ">>>>>>>>>>" (10 times)

            Precomputation: dp[0]=11 -> then step0: interval size=10 < 11 -> output -1 -> matches.

          And the sample: 
                Input: 10 5, s = "><>=" -> 
                Step0: '>' -> choose 1 -> update L=2
                Step1: '<' -> choose R=10 -> update R=9
                Step2: '>' -> choose L=2 -> update L=3
                Step3: '=' -> but we have [3,9] -> not singleton -> output -1? 

          But the sample output for "><>=" is 5,8,6,7.

          So we must choose a different strategy? 

          Alternatively, we can choose the maximal for '>' and the minimal for '<'? 

          Or we can choose arbitrarily? 

          How about we choose the midpoint? 

          But the problem: we are free.

          Since the sample outputs are not produced by the minimal/maximal, and the problem does not require a specific one, we choose the formula from the editorial:

            For '<': guess_val = max( (L+R+1)/2, L+dp[i+1] )
            For '>': guess_val = min( (L+R-1)/2, R-dp[i+1] )

          Then we have:

            Sample "10 5" and "><>=": 
                Step0: '>': min( (1+10-1)/2=5, 10-5=5) -> 5.
                Step1: '<': max( (6+10+1)/2=8, 6+2=8) -> 8.
                Step2: '>': min( (6+8-1)/2? -> L=6? R=8? 
                    Actually, after step0: L=6, R=10? 
                    Then step1: guess=8 -> update R=7? -> then step2: L=6, R=7? 
                    Then: min( (6+7-1)/2= (12)/2=6, 7-1=6) -> 6.
                Step3: '=': then we push 7? -> but the interval is [7,7]? 

                Then the guesses: 5,8,6,7 -> matches.

          And the sample "10 5" and "><<><": 
                Step0: '>': min( (1+10-1)/2=5, 10-5=5) -> 5 -> update L=6
                Step1: '<': max( (6+10+1)/2= (17)/2=8, 6+4=10) -> 10 -> update R=9
                Step2: '<': max( (6+9+1)/2= (16)/2=8, 6+3=9) -> 9 -> update R=8
                Step3: '>': min( (6+8-1)/2= (13)/2=6, 8-2=6) -> 6 -> update L=7
                Step4: '<': max( (7+8+1)/2= (16)/2=8, 7+1=8) -> 8 -> update R=7 -> but then the interval becomes [7,7]? 
                Then the guesses: 5,10,9,6,8.

            But the sample output is 4,10,8,5,7.

          Since the problem says we may output any, both are acceptable.

          Therefore, we'll use:

            For '<': guess_val = max( (L+R+1)/2, L+dp[i+1] )
            For '>': guess_val = min( (L+R-1)/2, R-dp[i+1] )

          And if we get an impossible condition (like the interval too small, or the candidate out of [L,R]), we output -1.

          Code:

            Note: use long long for all numbers.

          Let me test the fifth sample: 
                Input: 10 10, s = ">>>>>>>>>>" (10 times)
                Precomputation: 
                  dp[10]=1
                  dp[9]=2
                  dp[8]=3
                  ... dp[0]=11

                Then step0: 
                    interval [1,10] has size 10 < dp[0]=11 -> output -1.

          The third sample: 
                Input: 10 5, s = "<>="

            M=3, 
            Precomputation: 
                dp[3]=1
                i=2: s[2]='=' -> dp[2]=1
                i=1: s[1]='>' -> dp[1]=2   (because it's not the last? Actually, the last is at index2, so i=1 is not last -> then dp[1]= dp[2]+1=2)
                i=0: s[0]='<' -> dp[0]=3

            Step0: 
                s[0]='<' -> 
                    candidate1 = (1+10+1)/2=6
                    candidate2 = 1 + dp[1] = 1+2=3
                    guess_val = max(6,3)=6.

                Then update: R=6-1=5

            Step1:
                s[1]='>' -> 
                    candidate1 = (1+5-1)/2= (5)/2=2
                    candidate2 = 5 - dp[2] = 5-1=4
                    guess_val = min(2,4)=2

                Then update: L=2+1=3

            Step2:
                s[2]='=' -> 
                    but the interval is [3,5] -> not a singleton -> output -1.

            Matches the sample.

          Therefore, we write the code as described.

          Important: the last character must be the only one that can be '='. We assume the input is valid.

          However, what if the last character is not '=' and we have an '=' in the middle? 
            The problem says: the input is valid, so we don't need to check.

          Code:

            #include <iostream>
            #include <vector>
            #include <string>
            #include <algorithm>

          Let me test the sample input that was problematic: 
                Input: "10 5" and "><<><" -> 
                M=5, 
                dp[5]=1
                dp[4]=2
                dp[3]=3
                dp[2]=4
                dp[1]=5
                dp[0]=6

                Step0: s[0]='>', L=1, R=10
                    g = min( (1+10-1)/2=5, 10-5=5 ) = 5 -> push 5, then L=6
                Step1: s[1]='<', L=6, R=10
                    g = max( (6+10+1)/2= (17)/2=8, 6+4=10) = 10 -> push 10, then R=9
                Step2: s[2]='<', L=6, R=9
                    g = max( (6+9+1)/2= (16)/2=8, 6+3=9) = 9 -> push 9, then R=8
                Step3: s[3]='>', L=6, R=8
                    g = min( (6+8-1)/2= (13)/2=6, 8-2=6) = 6 -> push 6, then L=7
                Step4: s[4]='<', L=7, R=8
                    g = max( (7+8+1)/2= (16)/2=8, 7+1=8) = 8 -> push 8, then R=7

                Then the guesses: 5,10,9,6,8.

                The sample output is: 4,10,8,5,7 -> but we output 5,10,9,6,8.

                But the problem says: we may output any.

          So we are done.

          Note: the sample output for the fourth sample: 
                Input: "10 9" and string of 9 '>', we output: 1,2,...,9.

          Therefore, we submit the code.

          One more note: the division for large integers: 
                (L+R+1) / 2: when L and R are up to 10^18, then L+R+1 might be 2e18+1, which is within long long (since 2e18 is about 2*10^18, and long long can hold up to about 9e18).

          But note: L and R are positive, so no problem.

          Let me test with N=1, K=1, s="=":
                M=1
                dp[1]=1
                dp[0]=? 
                    i=0: s[0]='=' -> dp[0]=1
                Then step0: 
                    L=1, R=1 -> 
                    s[0]='=': then push 1 -> done.

          Another: N=1, K=1, s=">": 
                M=1
                dp[1]=1
                i=0: non-final? -> dp[0]=2
                Then step0: interval [1,1] has size 1 < 2 -> output -1.

          Another: N=2, K=1, s=">": 
                dp[0]=2 -> interval size=2>=2 -> then for '>', 
                    candidate1 = (1+2-1)/2= (2)/2=1
                    candidate2 = 2 - dp[1] -> dp[1]=1 -> 2-1=1
                    g=min(1,1)=1 -> then update L=2 -> then the next step? but we are done.
                Output: 1

          But theodora answers '>' -> then the number is greater than 1? Then the number must be 2? 
          And the interval becomes [2,2]? 

          However, the game ends? 

          The problem: the game ends after the guess? 

          So we output 1.

          But the sample: 
                Input: N=2, K=1, s=">" -> 
                Output: 1

          But the problem says: the game ends after K guesses? and we made 1 guess? 

          And the answer was '>', so we didn't win? 

          But the problem only requires to output the guesses.

          So it is valid.

          We'll submit the code as is.
