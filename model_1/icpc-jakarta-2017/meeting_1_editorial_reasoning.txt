We are given:
  N, K, T: number of subordinates, required meeting attendees (excluding boss), and maximum arrival time (relative to boss)
  An array A of N integers: the initial arrival times (each between 0 and T)

Conditions:
- The boss starts the meeting at time S (a positive real non-integer) after arriving.
- A subordinate must not arrive strictly before the boss (so arrival time >= 0) and not strictly after T (so <= T).
- We can adjust the arrival time of any subordinate by 1 second per dollar (each dollar can move one subordinate by one second, either earlier or later). But note:
   * We cannot have any subordinate arrive < 0 (because that would be strictly before the boss) or > T (because they would be fired).

Goal: 
  We want exactly K subordinates to be present at time S (i.e., their arrival time <= S) and the other N-K subordinates to arrive strictly after S (so their arrival time > S).

Constraints on S:
  Since S must be a positive real non-integer, we can choose any positive real number that is not an integer. This avoids the possibility of a subordinate arriving exactly at S (which would cause ambiguity: we require that exactly K subordinates are present at S, meaning they must have arrived at or before S, and the others must arrive strictly after S). However, note that we can adjust the arrival times arbitrarily (with cost). The key is that we can avoid having anyone at exactly S by adjusting if necessary? Actually, note: we can choose S arbitrarily (as long as it is non-integer) and we can adjust the arrival times arbitrarily (with cost). So we can always avoid having an arrival time exactly at S by either moving S slightly or by adjusting the arrival times.

But note: the problem says we can adjust the arrival times arbitrarily (by paying). So we can set the arrival times arbitrarily as long as they are in [0, T]. Therefore, we can design an ideal set of arrival times.

The problem then reduces to: 
  We want to assign new arrival times x_i (0 <= x_i <= T) such that:
    There exists a real number S (non-integer) with exactly K subordinates having x_i <= S and the rest having x_i > S.

This condition is equivalent to: 
  We can sort the x_i so that the K-th smallest is <= S and the (K+1)-th smallest is > S. But note: we can choose S arbitrarily as long as it is non-integer. So we can set S to be any value between the K-th smallest and the (K+1)-th smallest. Therefore, the condition is that the K-th smallest x_i must be strictly less than the (K+1)-th smallest? Actually, if we have two equal values, say the K-th and (K+1)-th are both a, then we cannot set S such that exactly K are <= S and the rest > S because if we set S between a and the next distinct value, then both a's would be <= S? 

But note: we can adjust the times arbitrarily. So we can make sure that the K-th smallest is strictly less than the (K+1)-th smallest. Therefore, the condition is always achievable as long as we can assign the times arbitrarily? However, we are constrained by the initial times and the cost to adjust.

Thus, the problem becomes:

  We wish to choose x_i (0 <= x_i <= T) so that when we sort the x_i in increasing order, we have:
      x_{(1)} <= x_{(2)} <= ... <= x_{(K)} < x_{(K+1)} <= ... <= x_{(N)}

  and the cost sum_i |x_i - A_i| is minimized.

But note: the condition "x_{(K)} < x_{(K+1)}" is necessary? Actually, we can have ties? However, if we have two subordinates with the same time, say a, then if we set S = a (which is an integer) we cannot use that S. But note: we can choose S arbitrarily (non-integer). So we can set S to be a value arbitrarily close to a. However, if two subordinates have the same time a, then both will be present at any S >= a. Therefore, to have exactly K present, we cannot have more than one subordinate at the threshold? Actually, we can have multiple at the same time, but then we can adjust one of them to be slightly above or below? 

But the problem: we require exactly K. So if we have two subordinates at the same time a, then we cannot have one of them counted as present and the other not? Because at any S, if S >= a then both are present, and if S < a then both are absent. 

Therefore, we must avoid having more than one subordinate at the same time? Actually, we can have multiple at the same time as long as we have exactly K subordinates with time <= a and the rest with time > a. How? 

We can set S such that a-Îµ < S < a? Then the subordinates at time a would not be present? But that is if we set S < a. Alternatively, we can set S such that a < S < (next distinct value) and then the subordinates at a are present. 

So the problem is not about distinct values per se, but about the count. Actually, the condition is:

  We must have at least K subordinates with time <= S and at least N-K subordinates with time > S.

But note: the requirement is exactly K present. Therefore, we require:
   count { i: x_i <= S } = K
   => count { i: x_i > S } = N-K.

This implies that the K-th smallest value must be <= S and the (K+1)-th smallest must be > S. Therefore, we must have:
   x_{(K)} <= S < x_{(K+1)}

However, note that if we have only K subordinates, then we don't have a (K+1)-th subordinate? Actually, N>=K, but we have K from 1 to N. In fact, if K = N, then we require all subordinates to be present. Then we don't have a (K+1)-th element. So we require:
   For K < N: x_{(K)} <= S < x_{(K+1)}
   For K = N: we require all subordinates to be present. Then we require S >= x_{(N)}. But we can set S arbitrarily large? However, note that we cannot set S > T because then a subordinate that arrives at T would be present (since T<=S) and we are allowed to set S arbitrarily as long as it's positive and non-integer? But what if T is an integer? Then we can set S = T+0.5? However, note: the constraint on subordinates is that they must not be > T. So we cannot have any x_i > T. Therefore, if we set S > T, then every subordinate (with x_i<=T) is present. That is acceptable for K=N. But what about the condition for K=N? Then we require exactly N subordinates present, which we have.

However, for K=N, we don't have a (K+1)-th element. So the condition is simply that the last subordinate (the N-th) is <= S. We can set S to be any non-integer greater than or equal to the maximum x_i. 

Similarly, for K=0, we require no subordinate present? Then we set S to be less than the smallest x_i. But note: the condition that S is positive and non-integer. So we can set S as small as we want? However, we have the constraint that subordinates cannot be <0. So the smallest x_i must be >0? Actually, we can set x_i to be 0? Then if we set S=0.5, a subordinate at 0 is present. Therefore, to have 0 subordinates present, we must set all x_i > S. Since S>0, we must set every x_i >0. But note: we can set x_i arbitrarily? However, if we have a subordinate initially at 0, we can move it to 1 (with cost 1) and then set S=0.5. Then no one is present? But wait, we require exactly 0? Actually, the problem says "exactly K people (excluding you)" and K=0. So we need no subordinate present.

But note: the condition that the subordinate must not arrive strictly before the boss: so x_i>=0. And we require x_i > S for all i. Since S>0, we can set x_i to any value in (S, T]. 

So in summary, we can design the entire set of arrival times arbitrarily (within [0,T]) at a cost of |x_i - A_i| for each subordinate. And we require that:

   If K = 0: we require that the smallest x_i > S for some S>0. This is equivalent to having all x_i >0? Actually, we can set S arbitrarily close to 0. So we require that the smallest x_i is >0? Because if one x_i is 0, then at S=0.5, that subordinate is present. So we require that all x_i are >0.

   Similarly, for K=N: we require that the largest x_i <= S for some S. Since we can set S arbitrarily large (as long as we don't exceed T? Actually, we can set S up to T? But we can set S beyond T? However, the problem does not restrict S to be <=T? It only restricts the subordinates to be <=T. So we can set S > T? Then all x_i (which are <=T) are <=S. Therefore, for K=N, we don't require any condition on the maximum x_i? Actually, we can set S arbitrarily large? But note: the problem says "positive real non-integer", so we can set S = T+0.5 if we wish. Therefore, for K=N, we don't require that the maximum x_i is below T? Actually, the maximum x_i must be <=T (by constraint). Then setting S = T+0.5 will include everyone. So condition for K=N is automatically satisfied as long as we assign x_i in [0,T]? 

But wait: what if we set all x_i to T? Then we must set S>=T. But if we set S=T+0.5, then we are including everyone. So it works.

Therefore, the constraints for the assignment are:

   Condition 1: For K=0: we require that every x_i >0? Actually, we can set S to be between 0 and the smallest x_i? But if the smallest x_i is 0, then we cannot avoid having that subordinate? So we require min_i x_i > 0.

   Condition 2: For K in [1, N-1]: we require that the K-th smallest x_i < the (K+1)-th smallest x_i? Actually, we don't require strict inequality? We can have multiple subordinates at the same value as long as we break them appropriately? But we cannot. For example, if we have two subordinates at the same value a, and we want one to be present and the other not, that is impossible. Therefore, we must have at least K subordinates that are <= S and at least N-K subordinates that are > S. This is equivalent to: we require that the K-th smallest value is strictly less than the (K+1)-th smallest value? 

But note: we can assign the same value to multiple subordinates? However, if we assign the same value a to two subordinates, then both will be either present or absent. So to have exactly K present, we must have:

   Let x_{(1)} <= x_{(2)} <= ... <= x_{(N)}.

   We require:
        x_{(K)} <= S < x_{(K+1)}   [for K in [1, N-1]]
        and for K=0: x_{(1)} > S (which forces S < min_i x_i) and we can set S between 0 and min_i x_i? But if min_i x_i=0, then we cannot set S in (0, min_i x_i) because that would be negative? Actually, S must be positive. So we require min_i x_i > 0? 

   For K=N: we require S >= x_{(N)}? But we can set S arbitrarily large? So no constraint on x_{(N)}? Actually, we can set S arbitrarily large? But note: the problem says "positive", so we can set S=1.0 if we wish? However, if x_{(N)} is 10, then we set S=10.5? So we require that we can set S>=x_{(N)}. Since we can set S arbitrarily large, we don't need to change the x_i for K=N? 

However, wait: we cannot set S arbitrarily large? The problem does not restrict S? It only says positive real non-integer. So yes, we can set it arbitrarily large. Therefore, for K=N, we don't require any condition on the x_i? Actually, we require that all x_i are <= T, but that's already enforced.

But note: if we set x_i arbitrarily, we can set them to any values in [0,T]. Therefore, the condition for K=N is automatically satisfied.

Similarly, for K=0: we require that all x_i are >0. But note: we can set them to any value in (0, T]. 

Therefore, the problem breaks into:

   Case 1: K = 0. Then we require that every x_i > 0. The cost is the sum over i of the cost to adjust A_i to a positive value (and we can set x_i as close as possible to A_i to minimize cost). But note: we can set x_i to any value in (0, T]. The minimal cost for a subordinate i is:
        If A_i > 0, then we can leave it as is? But we can set it to A_i? However, we require x_i>0. If A_i>0, then we can set x_i = A_i and it's already >0. So cost 0.
        If A_i = 0, then we must move it to at least 0.0001? But we are allowed to move continuously? Actually, the cost is |x_i - A_i|. So to set x_i to 0.5, the cost is 0.5? But the problem says we can change by one second per dollar? And we can do fractional moves? Actually, no: the problem says by paying $1 we can change by one second. So we must move by integer amounts? But the problem says: "by paying $1 and choosing a subordinate, you can change the subordinate's arrival time by one second earlier or one second later". This implies that the adjustments are in whole seconds. Therefore, we can only assign integer values? But the problem also says: "You can adjust the arrival time of the same subordinate more than once." and we can adjust arbitrarily? So we can assign any integer value? 

Wait: the problem states that the initial A_i are integers, and we can adjust by integer amounts (each dollar moves by one second). Therefore, the x_i must be integers? 

But note: the constraint that a subordinate must not arrive strictly before the boss (so x_i>=0) and not strictly later than T (so x_i<=T). So we are assigning integer arrival times.

However, then how do we achieve having the meeting at a non-integer time? 

For example: if we set the arrival times to integers, then we can choose S to be a non-integer. Then the condition is: 
   A subordinate i is present if and only if x_i <= S. Since x_i is integer, this is equivalent to x_i <= floor(S). 

But note: if we set S between integers, say between m and m+1 (m integer), then the condition for a subordinate is: it is present if x_i <= m (because S < m+1 and if x_i = m+1, then m+1 > S). 

Therefore, if we assign integer arrival times, then the meeting at time S (a non-integer) will have exactly the subordinates with arrival time <= floor(S). 

So the condition becomes: we must assign integer x_i in [0, T] such that there exists an integer m (which will be floor(S)) satisfying:
        count { i: x_i <= m } = K.

Why? Because we set S in (m, m+1). Then the subordinates with x_i <= m are present (since m < S) and the ones with x_i >= m+1 are not (because S < m+1). 

But note: we also have the constraint that the (K+1)-th smallest x_i must be at least m+1? Actually, we require that the number of subordinates with x_i<=m is exactly K. Therefore, the condition is that the K-th smallest x_i must be <= m and the (K+1)-th smallest must be >= m+1? Actually, if the (K+1)-th smallest is m, then we have at least K+1 subordinates <= m? So we require that the K-th smallest is <= m and the (K+1)-th smallest (if exists) is at least m+1? 

But note: we can have multiple x_i equal to m. Then if we have several x_i = m, then we can set m to be the threshold? Actually, we require that the count of x_i <= m is exactly K. So we can have:

   Let the sorted x_i: ... , a, m, m, ... , m, b, ... 
   We want the last subordinate that is <= m to be the K-th. So we can set m such that the number of x_i <= m is K. Then the condition is satisfied.

Therefore, the problem becomes:

   We wish to assign integer x_i in [0, T] for each subordinate i, such that there exists an integer m for which:
        |{ i: x_i <= m }| = K.

   And we minimize the total cost: sum_i |x_i - A_i|.

But note: we are free to choose the integer m? Actually, we can choose m arbitrarily as long as it is an integer? But note: we are constrained by the requirement that the meeting time S is positive and non-integer, so m must be at least 0? Actually, we can set m=0? Then S in (0,1). Then we require exactly K subordinates to have x_i <=0. But note: x_i>=0, so x_i<=0 implies x_i=0. So we require exactly K subordinates at 0. 

But we are free to choose m? 

Therefore, we can choose m arbitrarily? Then we can choose the m that minimizes the total cost? 

So the problem: for each possible m (what are the possible m? m must be an integer in [0, T]? Actually, if m<0, then we require x_i<=m, but x_i>=0, so if m<0, then we require all x_i <= m which is impossible. Similarly, if m>=T+1, then we require x_i<=m, but since x_i<=T, then all subordinates are included. So m in [0, T]? 

But note: if we set m=0, then we require exactly K subordinates at 0 and the rest at least 1? 
If we set m=1, then we require exactly K subordinates at 0 or 1, and the rest at least 2? 
...

So we can iterate m from 0 to T? But T can be up to 1e9, and N up to 100,000. We cannot iterate over all m.

Therefore, we must find an efficient way.

Alternatively, we can note:

   Condition: we require that the K-th smallest x_i is at most m and the (K+1)-th smallest x_i is at least m+1? Actually, we require that the number of x_i <= m is exactly K. Therefore, the K+1 smallest x_i must be at least m+1? 

But note: the condition is only on the counts: we require exactly K subordinates to be <= m. There is no requirement on the values beyond that. 

Therefore, we can design the x_i arbitrarily as long as:

   There are exactly K subordinates with x_i <= m, and the remaining N-K have x_i >= m+1? 

But note: we are allowed to set x_i to any integer in [0, T]. Therefore, the constraint is that the N-K subordinates must be at least m+1 and at most T, and the K subordinates must be at least 0 and at most m.

Therefore, the problem becomes:

   We choose an integer m (0<=m<=T) and then assign:

        For K subordinates: x_i in [0, m] (we choose integers)
        For the other N-K: x_i in [m+1, T]

   and we minimize the total adjustment cost: sum_i |x_i - A_i|.

But note: we are free to choose which subordinates are in which group? 

Therefore, we can choose which subordinates are in the group that must be <= m (call this group L) and which are in the group that must be >= m+1 (call this group R). Then the cost for a subordinate i is:

        If i is in L: we must set x_i <= m. The minimal cost is the minimal adjustment to bring A_i to the interval [0, m]. That is:
             if A_i <= m: we can set x_i = A_i (cost 0)
             if A_i > m: we must set x_i to at most m, so we set x_i = m (cost A_i - m)

        If i is in R: we must set x_i >= m+1. Similarly:
             if A_i >= m+1: set x_i = A_i (cost 0)
             if A_i < m+1: set x_i = m+1 (cost m+1 - A_i)

Therefore, the total cost for a fixed m and a fixed assignment of subordinates to L and R is:
        cost(m, assignment) = 
            for i in L: max(0, A_i - m)   [because we set to min(A_i, m) but note: we can set to any value in [0,m] and the minimal cost is achieved by setting x_i = min(max(0, A_i), m) ??? Actually, we can set x_i to the closest point in [0, m] to A_i. Since the interval [0,m] is convex, the closest point is:
                if A_i is in [0, m] -> A_i (cost 0)
                if A_i < 0 -> 0? but A_i>=0 by input, so skip.
                if A_i > m -> m (cost A_i - m)

            for i in R: 
                if A_i in [m+1, T] -> 0
                if A_i < m+1 -> we set to m+1 (cost m+1 - A_i) [but note: if A_i is below 0? again, A_i>=0. Also, if A_i > T? but A_i<=T, so we don't have to worry about that? Actually, we have the constraint that x_i<=T. For the R group, we set x_i to max(A_i, m+1) but if A_i is above T? Then we cannot set to A_i? Actually, if A_i is above T, then we must set to T? 

Wait: we have an additional constraint: we cannot set x_i > T. Therefore, for an i in R, we require x_i in [m+1, T]. So:

        if A_i > T: then we must set x_i = T (cost A_i - T) -> but the input ensures A_i<=T, so this case doesn't occur.

        if A_i < m+1: we set x_i = m+1 (if m+1 <= T) -> but if m+1 > T, then we have a problem? Actually, we require that for the R group, we set x_i in [m+1, T]. If m+1 > T, then this interval is empty? So we cannot assign any subordinate to R? 

Therefore, we must have m such that m+1 <= T? Actually, if m=T, then the R group must be in [T+1, T] which is empty. So we cannot have any R group? Then we must have all subordinates in L? That is only possible if K=N. Similarly, if m=T, then we require exactly K=N? 

But note: if we choose m=T, then the condition is: 
        Group L: x_i <= T (which is always true) so we can assign all subordinates to L. But then we require |L| = K. So if K=N, we can set m=T. For the R group, we don't have any, so no constraint? Actually, the condition is that we have exactly K in L and the rest in R. If K=N, then we have no one in R. So we can set m=T.

Similarly, if we choose m such that m+1 <= T, then the R group is nonempty? Actually, if m<T, then m+1<=T? But if m=T-1, then m+1 = T, which is acceptable. If m=T, then we cannot have any R group? So:

   For K = N: we must set m=T. Then the cost for each subordinate i: since they are all in L, we set x_i = min(A_i, T) = A_i? Actually, we can set to A_i? But note: we require x_i<=T and A_i<=T, so we set x_i=A_i? Then cost 0? 

   But wait: if we set m=T, then for a subordinate in L: we set x_i = min(A_i, T) = A_i? So cost 0. Then total cost=0? 

   However, what if we have a different m? For K=N, we must have m>= the N-th smallest x_i? But we can set m to any value >= the maximum x_i? Actually, we require exactly N in L. So we can set m to any value from max_i x_i to T? And we set x_i arbitrarily? 

   Actually, we can set m=T. Then we assign every subordinate to L. Then the cost is 0 if we set x_i=A_i? But what if A_i=T? Then we set x_i=T. 

   However, for K=N, we have an alternative: we can set m to be the maximum A_i? Then we set x_i=A_i? Then the cost is 0? But then we have to have the R group empty? And we require exactly K=N in L. So yes, that works. Therefore, we don't necessarily have to set m=T? 

   But note: if we set m to be the maximum A_i (say M) and M<T, then we can set x_i=A_i. Then the condition: the count of subordinates with x_i<=m: we have all of them? because the maximum is M<=m? Then we have K=N? So we can set m=M. Then the cost is 0.

   However, we are free to choose m? So for K=N, we can choose m = max_i A_i? Then the cost is 0? 

   But wait: what if we set m = max_i A_i? Then the R group must be in [m+1, T]. But we have no one in R. So that is acceptable. 

   Therefore, the condition for K=N is: we can set m to be at least max_i A_i? Then we set x_i = A_i? So cost=0? 

   But what if we set m to be less than max_i A_i? Then we must set the subordinates that have A_i>m to m (cost A_i-m). And the ones that are below m remain. Then the cost is the sum over the subordinates with A_i>m of (A_i-m). This is positive? So the minimal cost for K=N is 0? 

   Similarly, for K=0: we set m = -1? But m must be in [0, T]. Actually, we require m to be in [0, T]. Then for K=0, we must have no subordinate in L? So we set m to any value? But then we require that the count of subordinates in L is 0? So we set m to any value? But then for the R group, we require that every subordinate is in R and set to [m+1, T]. 

        The minimal cost for a subordinate i: 
            if A_i < m+1: we set x_i = m+1 (cost m+1 - A_i)
            if A_i >= m+1: we set x_i = A_i (cost 0)

        So the cost is: sum_i max(0, m+1 - A_i).

        We are free to choose m? So we choose m to minimize the cost? 

        Note: m must be chosen such that m+1 <= T? Because we must assign the R group to [m+1, T]. Actually, if m=T, then the R group must be in [T+1, T] -> empty -> then we have no one in R? But we require all in R? So we must have m<T? 

        Therefore, m in [0, T-1].

        Then the cost function is: 
            cost(m) = sum_i max(0, m+1 - A_i)

        This is a function of m? And we can minimize it over m in [0, T-1]. 

        Note: the cost function is piecewise linear and decreasing then increasing? Actually, as m increases, each term for which A_i <= m+1 is increasing? Specifically, for a fixed i, the term is 0 for m+1 <= A_i, and then for m+1 > A_i, it is (m+1 - A_i) which is increasing in m. So the entire function is non-decreasing? 

        Actually: 
            For m < A_i - 1: the term is 0.
            For m >= A_i - 1: the term is m+1 - A_i.

        So as m increases, the cost increases. Therefore, the minimal cost for K=0 is achieved at m=0? Then cost = sum_i max(0, 1 - A_i). 

        Example: the third sample: "2 1 0" -> wait, no, the third sample is: 
            "2 1 1
             0 0"
            Output: 1

        But wait: the third sample is K=1, not K=0.

        The fourth sample: 
            "2 1 0
             0 0"
            Output: -1.

        For K=0 in the fourth sample: 
            Input: N=2, K=0, T=0, A=[0,0]

            Then we require m in [0, T-1] = [0, -1] -> empty? So no valid m? Therefore, it is impossible? 

        Why? Because if T=0, then we cannot set any subordinate to a value >0? Because they must be <=0. So the only possible value is 0. Then we cannot have the R group: because the R group must be in [m+1, T] = [m+1,0]. If m+1<=0, then the interval [m+1,0] is nonempty only if m+1<=0? But we also require that the subordinate in R must be set to at least m+1. But if we set a subordinate to 0, then that is not > m? Actually, we require x_i>=m+1 and m+1<=0. The only possibility is m+1=0? Then x_i=0. But then if we set S in (m, m+1) = (-1,0) for m=-1? But we cannot use m=-1 because m must be in [0, T]=[0,0]. So m=0? Then the R group must be in [1,0] -> empty. Therefore, we cannot assign any subordinate to R? But we have two subordinates and K=0 requires that both are in R. So impossible -> output -1.

        Therefore, the algorithm:

          Step 1: Check for impossible cases.

          When is it impossible?
            - If K=0: we require that we can set all x_i in [m+1, T] for some m in [0, T-1]. But if T=0, then [m+1, T] = [1,0] which is empty -> impossible.
            - Similarly, for any K, we require that the R group is assigned to [m+1, T]. This interval is empty if m+1 > T -> but we only use m such that m+1<=T? Actually, we avoid m=T when K<N? 
            - For K=N: we require that the L group is [0, m] with m>=0. This interval is always nonempty? Actually, we can set m arbitrarily? But note: we require that we can assign the subordinates to [0, m] without exceeding T. Since m can be chosen in [0, T] (and for K=N, we set m=T) then [0, T] is the entire allowed range. So always possible? 

          Actually, for K in [1, N-1]: 
            We require that the interval for L is [0, m] and for R is [m+1, T]. Both intervals must be nonempty? Actually, we can have m=0? Then L is [0,0] and R is [1,T]. This is acceptable if T>=1? If T=0, then m=0: then R is [1,0] -> empty -> then we cannot have the R group? But we need N-K>0? So if T=0 and K<N, then it is impossible? 

          Therefore, the only impossible cases are:
            - T=0 and K < N? Because then we must have at least one subordinate in R? But R is [m+1,0] with m in [0, T-1] = [0,-1] -> no valid m. Alternatively, if we try m=0 (the only m in [0,0]), then R is [1,0] -> empty. So we cannot assign the N-K subordinates to R. 
            - Also, if T=0 and K=0? Then we require all in R? But R is empty -> impossible.

          Actually, T=0 and any K in [0, N] with K<N? But if K=N, then we assign all to L: [0,0] -> which is nonempty? So only when K<N and T=0, it is impossible? 

          However, if T=0 and K=N, then we set m=0? Then the condition is satisfied? 

          Therefore, impossible if:
             (T == 0 and K < N)   OR ...? 

          Also, what if T>0 but we cannot assign the subordinates to the intervals? Actually, we are free to assign arbitrarily? So as long as the intervals are nonempty, we can assign? The intervals [0, m] and [m+1, T] are nonempty if:
             [0, m] is nonempty if m>=0? which it is (since m>=0) and [m+1, T] is nonempty if m+1<=T? So we require m<=T-1? 

          But for K=N, we use m=T? Then we don't use the R group? So the interval for R is [T+1, T] which is empty, but that's acceptable because we have no one in R. 

          Therefore, the constraints on m:

             For K in [0, N-1]: we require m in [0, T-1] (because we need the R group to be nonempty? Actually, we need the interval [m+1, T] to be nonempty? But if T=0, then we already ruled out. For T>=1, m in [0, T-1] ensures [m+1, T] is nonempty? Actually, if T=1, then m in [0,0] and then [1,1] is nonempty. 

          However, note: we are assigning N-K subordinates to R? So we need at least one value in [m+1, T] to assign? Actually, we can assign multiple subordinates to the same value? So the interval being nonempty is sufficient? 

          Therefore, the only global impossible condition is:
             if T=0 and K < N -> impossible? 

          But also: what if T>0, but we have to assign the R group to [m+1, T] and we have a subordinate that we cannot push to [m+1, T] without cost? Actually, we can push arbitrarily? The constraint is that we can set to any integer in [0,T]. So if we set m in [0, T-1], then we can assign the R group to [m+1, T]? 

          Therefore, the algorithm:

            if T == 0:
                if K == N:
                    # We can set all subordinates to 0? Then we set m=0? Then condition: count in L (<=0) is N? Then we set x_i=0 for all? cost=0? 
                    # But the initial A_i are 0? so cost=0? 
                    return 0
                else:
                    return -1

            But note: the input constraint: T>=0. And in the sample: "2 1 0" -> T=0, K=1, N=2 -> then output -1.

          However, there is another impossible case? 

          Consider: what if we choose m and then assign the subordinates arbitrarily? But we are free to assign arbitrarily? So the only constraint is the intervals? 

          Therefore, the problem reduces to:

            We wish to choose an integer m (in a set M) and then choose a set L of K subordinates to be assigned to [0, m] and the rest R to [m+1, T] such that the total cost is minimized.

          The set M for m is:

            if K < N: m in [0, T-1]   (because we need the R group to be in [m+1, T] and this interval must be nonempty -> m+1<=T -> m<=T-1)
            if K = N: m in [max_i A_i, T]   ??? Actually, we can set m to any value from the maximum of the chosen values? But note: we can set the x_i arbitrarily? So we can set m to any value from 0 to T? However, we want to minimize cost. And the cost for a subordinate i in L is max(0, A_i - m). So we want m to be as large as possible? 

          Actually, for K=N, we assign all to L. The cost for subordinate i is max(0, A_i - m). Why? Because if A_i > m, we have to set x_i = m, so cost = A_i - m. If A_i <= m, we set x_i = A_i, cost=0. 

          Therefore, the cost for K=N is: 
                cost(m) = sum_i max(0, A_i - m)

          And we wish to minimize this over m in [max_i A_i, T]? Actually, if we set m >= max_i A_i, then the cost is 0? 

          But note: we can set m to be the maximum A_i? Then the cost is 0? 

          Therefore, for K=N, the minimal cost is 0? 

          However, what if we set m less than the maximum A_i? Then for the subordinates with A_i>m, we have cost A_i-m. So the minimal cost is achieved when m is the maximum A_i? Then cost = sum_{A_i>m} (A_i-m) = 0? 

          Actually: if we set m = max_i A_i, then for the subordinate with A_i = max, we set x_i = max_i A_i? cost 0. For others, we set to A_i? cost 0. 

          Therefore, for K=N, the minimal cost is 0? 

          But wait: what if we set m to be larger than the maximum? Then cost is 0 as well. So we can choose m = max_i A_i? 

          Therefore, the problem for K=N is trivial: cost=0.

          Similarly, for K=0: we set m in [0, T-1] and the cost is: 
                cost(m) = sum_i max(0, m+1 - A_i)

          And we minimize this over m in [0, T-1]. 

          For K in [1, N-1]: the cost for a fixed m and a fixed assignment of subordinates to L and R is:

                cost(m, L, R) = 
                    sum_{i in L} max(0, A_i - m)   +   sum_{i in R} max(0, m+1 - A_i)

          But note: we are free to choose which subordinates go to L and which to R? 

          Therefore, for a fixed m, we can choose L as any set of K subordinates. Then the cost is:

                cost(m) = 
                    [for each subordinate i, we have two possible costs: 
                         c_i(L) = max(0, A_i - m)   if we put i in L
                         c_i(R) = max(0, m+1 - A_i) if we put i in R]

                    Then we want to choose a set L of size K to minimize: 
                         sum_{i in L} c_i(L) + sum_{i in R} c_i(R)

          But note: we can rewrite the total cost as:

                = sum_{i in L} [ max(0, A_i - m) ] + sum_{i in R} [ max(0, m+1 - A_i) ]

                = constant + ...? 

          Actually, we can define for each subordinate i:

                base(m) = max(0, m+1 - A_i)   # because if we put i in R, we pay this; if we put in L, we pay max(0, A_i-m) and we can express the total cost in terms of base and the decision.

          Alternatively, consider:

                total_cost = [sum_{i in L} ( max(0, A_i - m) - max(0, m+1 - A_i) )] + [sum_i max(0, m+1 - A_i)]

          Why? Because we can break the cost for R: 
                sum_{i in R} max(0, m+1 - A_i) = [sum_i max(0, m+1 - A_i)] - [sum_{i in L} max(0, m+1 - A_i)]

          Then:

                total_cost = sum_i max(0, m+1 - A_i) 
                            + sum_{i in L} [ max(0, A_i - m) - max(0, m+1 - A_i) ]

          Now, we wish to minimize this over L of size K. The first term is independent of L. The second term: for each i, we have a value:

                d_i = max(0, A_i - m) - max(0, m+1 - A_i)

          Then we wish to choose K subordinates to be in L that minimizes the sum of d_i.

          Alternatively, we wish to minimize the entire expression, so we can minimize the sum of d_i over L? 

          Therefore, we can compute:

                base = sum_i max(0, m+1 - A_i)
                and then select the K subordinates with the smallest d_i.

          But note: we want to minimize base + (sum of d_i for i in L). Since base is fixed, we minimize the sum of d_i for i in L by taking the smallest d_i.

          Therefore, for a fixed m, the minimal cost is:

                cost(m) = base + (sum of the K smallest d_i)

          where d_i = max(0, A_i - m) - max(0, m+1 - A_i)

          But we must check: what is d_i?

          Consider the value of A_i relative to m and m+1.

          Case 1: A_i <= m
                Then: 
                    max(0, A_i - m) = 0
                    max(0, m+1 - A_i) = m+1 - A_i
                So d_i = 0 - (m+1 - A_i) = A_i - (m+1)

          Case 2: A_i >= m+1
                Then:
                    max(0, A_i - m) = A_i - m
                    max(0, m+1 - A_i) = 0
                So d_i = (A_i - m) - 0 = A_i - m

          Case 3: A_i in (m, m+1) -> but A_i is integer? So this interval is empty? 

          Therefore, we have:

                if A_i <= m: d_i = A_i - (m+1)
                if A_i >= m+1: d_i = A_i - m

          Note: d_i can be negative? In case 1, A_i<=m, so A_i - (m+1) <= -1.

          Therefore, we can compute:

                base = sum_{i} max(0, m+1 - A_i) 
                     = sum_{i: A_i <= m} (m+1 - A_i)   [because if A_i>=m+1, then max(0, m+1 - A_i)=0]

                and then we form an array d of size N:

                    d_i = 
                         if A_i <= m: A_i - (m+1)
                         if A_i >= m+1: A_i - m

          Then we select the K smallest values in d.

          Then cost(m) = base + (sum of the K smallest d_i)

          How to compute this for a fixed m? 

          We can do:

                base = 0
                d = []
                for each i:
                    if A_i <= m:
                        base += (m+1 - A_i)
                        d_i = A_i - (m+1)
                    else: # A_i >= m+1
                        d_i = A_i - m

                Then sort d and take the K smallest, and then add base.

          However, note: the K smallest d_i? But we are summing the K smallest? 

          But note: the entire expression: base + (sum of K smallest d_i) might be simplified? 

          Alternatively, we can note that the total cost can also be expressed by:

                = base + (sum of the K smallest d_i)

                base = sum_{i: A_i<=m} (m+1 - A_i)

                and the d_i for A_i<=m is A_i - (m+1) = - (m+1 - A_i)

                So if we take a subordinate i with A_i<=m and put it in L, then we are adding d_i = A_i - (m+1) = - (m+1 - A_i). 

                Therefore, if we put such an i in L, then the term for i in base is (m+1-A_i) and we add d_i = - (m+1-A_i). So they cancel? 

                And if we put an i with A_i>=m+1 in L, then we add d_i = A_i-m. But note: if we put such an i in L, we pay max(0, A_i-m) = A_i-m. And if we put it in R, we pay 0. But in base we have 0 for such an i? So the total for such an i: if we put in L: we pay A_i-m, and if we put in R: we pay 0. 

                Therefore, the cost for an i:

                    if we put in L: 
                         if A_i<=m: cost = 0? (because base had (m+1-A_i) and then we subtract that) -> 0
                         if A_i>=m+1: cost = A_i - m   (and base didn't include anything for this i)

                    if we put in R:
                         if A_i<=m: cost = m+1 - A_i   (which is the base term, and we don't subtract because we don't choose it for L) 
                         if A_i>=m+1: cost = 0

                Then the total cost is:
                    = sum_{i in R and A_i<=m} (m+1-A_i) + sum_{i in L and A_i>=m+1} (A_i-m)

                And we are free to assign? So we wish to minimize: 
                    cost = 
                         for i: 
                             if we assign to R and A_i<=m: cost (m+1-A_i)
                             if we assign to L and A_i>=m+1: cost (A_i-m)

                Therefore, we can avoid the base and d_i formulation and simply:

                    We wish to assign each subordinate i to either:
                         L: then cost = 0 if A_i<=m, and A_i-m if A_i>m.
                         R: then cost = m+1-A_i if A_i<=m, and 0 if A_i>m.

                    Then the total cost = 
                         sum_{i: assigned to L} [ A_i>m ? (A_i-m) : 0 ] 
                         + sum_{i: assigned to R} [ A_i<=m ? (m+1-A_i) : 0 ]

                    And we require |L| = K.

                    This is equivalent to: 
                         = sum_{i: A_i>m and i in L} (A_i-m) + sum_{i: A_i<=m and i in R} (m+1-A_i)

                And we can choose the assignment arbitrarily? 

                    We want to minimize: 
                         = [sum_{i in L and A_i>m} (A_i-m)] + [sum_{i in R and A_i<=m} (m+1-A_i)]

                But note: we can also think: 
                    The cost for an i with A_i<=m: if we put in R: we pay (m+1-A_i); if we put in L: we pay 0.
                    The cost for an i with A_i>=m+1: if we put in L: we pay (A_i-m); if we put in R: we pay 0.

                Therefore, we can define:

                    c_i = 
                         if A_i <= m: 
                             cost_R = m+1-A_i, cost_L = 0
                         if A_i >= m+1:
                             cost_L = A_i-m, cost_R = 0

                Then the total cost if we assign i to L is cost_L, to R is cost_R.

                But then the total cost = sum_i cost_{assigned group for i}

                And the constraint: |L|=K.

                Therefore, the minimal cost for fixed m is:

                    = sum_{i} cost_R(i)   +   sum_{i in L} [ cost_L(i) - cost_R(i) ]

                = constant + ...? 

                Actually, we can write:

                    total_cost = sum_i cost_R(i) + sum_{i in L} ( cost_L(i) - cost_R(i) )

                Now, define d_i = cost_L(i) - cost_R(i)

                    if A_i <= m: 
                         cost_L(i)=0, cost_R(i)=m+1-A_i -> d_i = 0 - (m+1-A_i) = A_i - (m+1)
                    if A_i >= m+1:
                         cost_L(i)=A_i-m, cost_R(i)=0 -> d_i = (A_i-m) - 0 = A_i - m

                Then total_cost = [sum_i cost_R(i)] + [sum_{i in L} d_i]

                And we wish to minimize this by choosing a set L of size K? 

                We can minimize by choosing the K subordinates with the smallest d_i? 

                But note: sum_i cost_R(i) is fixed? 

                    sum_i cost_R(i) = 
                         for A_i<=m: m+1-A_i
                         for A_i>=m+1: 0

                So that is base.

          Therefore, we have:

                cost(m) = base + (sum of the K smallest d_i)

          with base and d_i defined as above.

          Now, we must minimize cost(m) over m in:

            if K < N: m in [0, T-1]
            if K = N: we already know cost=0? 
            if K = 0: m in [0, T-1] and then the cost is base? Because we choose no one in L? Then the sum of the K smallest is 0? So cost(m) = base? Then we minimize base = sum_i max(0, m+1 - A_i) over m in [0, T-1]. 

          But note: for K=0, we do not choose any L? So we must take the sum of the 0 smallest? which is 0? Then cost(m)=base. 

          Actually, we can handle:

            if K = N: cost = 0 -> skip.

            else: (K in [0, N-1]) iterate m? but T can be up to 1e9? 

          How to avoid iterating over T? 

          Note: the cost function cost(m) is defined for integer m in [0, T-1] (if K<N). But T can be up to 1e9. We cannot iterate over all m.

          Therefore, we must find a way to minimize cost(m) without iterating over all m.

          Observing the function:

            base(m) = sum_{A_i<=m} (m+1 - A_i)

            d_i(m) = 
                 if A_i<=m: A_i - (m+1)
                 if A_i>=m+1: A_i - m

            Then we form an array d(m) of length N, and then take the K smallest and add to base(m).

          How does base(m) and the array d(m) change as m increases? 

          base(m) = (m+1) * (number of i with A_i<=m) - sum_{A_i<=m} A_i.

          The array d(m): 
                 for i with A_i<=m: d_i = A_i - (m+1) = - (m+1 - A_i)
                 for i with A_i>m: d_i = A_i - m   [note: we wrote A_i>=m+1, but if A_i>m then A_i>=m+1? since integers?]

          Actually, we can split the array d_i(m) into two parts: 
                 Part1: i with A_i <= m: d_i(m) = A_i - (m+1)
                 Part2: i with A_i > m: d_i(m) = A_i - m

          Then the entire array d(m) = 
                 [for A_i<=m: A_i - (m+1)] and [for A_i>m: A_i - m]

          Now, the K smallest elements in d(m) can be found by:

            We note that the values in part1 are negative? (since A_i<=m -> A_i - (m+1) <= -1) and the values in part2 are nonnegative? (since A_i>m -> A_i-m>=1). 

          Therefore, the K smallest will be:

            All the elements in part1 (because they are negative) and then the smallest (K - |part1|) elements in part2.

          So:

            Let L = number of A_i <= m.

            Then the K smallest are:

                 All L elements from part1: their sum = sum_{A_i<=m} (A_i - (m+1)) 
                 Plus the smallest (K - L) elements from part2? 

          But note: we have only N-L elements in part2. And if K < L, then we take only the K smallest in the entire array? Actually, the entire part1 is available and they are the smallest? So we take all of part1? and then we take the next (K - L) from part2? But wait: if K < L, then we take the K smallest from part1? Actually, the entire part1 has L elements, and we only need K, so we take the smallest K from the entire array? 

          However, all part1 are negative and part2 are nonnegative. So the smallest elements are the smallest elements in part1? But note: within part1, the smallest values are the ones with the smallest A_i? Actually, as m is fixed, the values in part1 are: A_i - (m+1). Since A_i are fixed, the smallest value in part1 is the smallest A_i minus (m+1). But we don't care about the order? We just want the sum of the K smallest? 

          Actually, the entire part1 is available and they are all negative. So the smallest K elements in the entire array are:

            The entire part1 (if K>=L) and then the smallest (K-L) from part2? 
            But if K < L, then the smallest K elements are the K smallest in part1? How do we compute the sum of the K smallest in part1? 

          Alternatively, we can precompute:

            Sort the array A.

            Then for a fixed m, we have:

                base(m) = (m+1)*L - S1   [where S1 = sum_{A_i<=m} A_i]

                The set d_i for i with A_i<=m: 
                    d_i = A_i - (m+1) = (A_i) - (m+1)   -> the sum of all these is (S1 - (m+1)*L)

                Now, we wish to take the K smallest d_i. 

                Since the part1 elements are the smallest, we take:

                    If K <= L:
                         We take the K smallest in part1? But note: in part1, the smallest d_i are the ones with the smallest A_i? Because d_i = A_i - (m+1): as A_i decreases, d_i decreases.

                         Therefore, the K smallest in the entire array are the K smallest A_i in part1? 

                         Let S1_K = the sum of the K smallest A_i among those <= m.

                         Then the sum of these d_i = S1_K - K*(m+1)

                    If K > L:
                         We take all L of part1: their sum = S1 - (m+1)*L
                         Then we take the smallest (K-L) from part2: which are the smallest (K-L) A_i in the part2? 

                         In part2: d_i = A_i - m. The smallest d_i in part2 are the smallest A_i in part2? 

                         Let S2_{K-L} = the sum of the smallest (K-L) A_i in part2.

                         Then the sum of these = S2_{K-L} - (K-L)*m

                Then the entire cost(m) = base(m) + [ sum of the K smallest d_i ]

                    = (m+1)*L - S1   + 
                         [ if K<=L: (S1_K - K*(m+1)) 
                           if K>L: (S1 - (m+1)*L) + (S2_{K-L} - (K-L)*m) ]

          Now, simplify:

            If K<=L:
                cost(m) = (m+1)*L - S1 + S1_K - K*(m+1)
                         = (m+1)*(L-K) + (S1_K - S1)

            If K>L:
                cost(m) = (m+1)*L - S1 + [ S1 - (m+1)*L + S2_{K-L} - (K-L)*m ]
                         = S2_{K-L} - (K-L)*m

          Therefore, we have:

                cost(m) = 
                    if K <= L: (m+1)*(L-K) + (S1_K - S1)
                    if K > L: S2_{K-L} - (K-L)*m

          Now, note:

            L = number of A_i <= m
            S1 = sum_{A_i<=m} A_i
            S1_K = the sum of the K smallest A_i? Actually, the K smallest A_i that are <=m? 

          How to compute these quickly? 

            We can sort the array A.

            Then we can precompute:

                Let B = sorted(A)

                Then we can precompute prefix sums: 
                    P[i] = B[0] + B[1] + ... + B[i-1]   for i=0..n

            Then for a given m:

                L = upper_bound in B for m -> index r such that B[0..r-1] <= m, so L = r.

                S1 = P[r]   (if r is the index, then P[r] = B[0] + ... + B[r-1])

            For S1_K: we want the sum of the K smallest in the entire array? But the entire array is sorted? Then the K smallest are the first K? 

            However, note: we want the K smallest that are <=m. Since the array is sorted, the smallest K elements that are <=m are the first min(K, r) of the entire array? 

            Actually, the entire array is sorted, so the smallest K elements are the first K. But we require that they are <=m. Since the array is sorted, the first K elements are the smallest. However, if the K-th element is <=m, then the first K are all <=m? 

            But if the K-th element is >m, then the first K include some that are >m? 

            Therefore, we need the sum of the smallest min(K, r) elements? 

            Actually, the smallest K elements that are <=m are the first min(K, r) of the entire array? 

            But wait: the entire array is sorted, so the smallest K elements are the first K. However, if the K-th element is <=m, then the first K are all <=m? Then S1_K = P[K]? 

            If the K-th element >m, then the first K elements are not all <=m? Then we take all the elements <=m? which are r elements? and then r < K? but that is the case K>r? which we are handling in the other branch? 

            Actually, when K<=L, we have r (which is L) >= K. Then the K smallest elements that are <=m are the first K? 

            Therefore: 
                S1_K = P[K]   (the sum of the first K elements)

            Then the expression for K<=L: 
                cost(m) = (m+1)*(r - K) + (P[K] - P[r])

          But wait: is that correct? 

          Example: 
                A = [1, 2, 3, 4] (n=4), m=3, so r=4 (if we use 0-indexed: the indices 0,1,2,3 are <=3 -> r=4). 
                Let K=2. Then L=r=4, which is >=K. 
                Then S1_K = P[2] = 1+2 = 3.
                S1 = P[4] = 1+2+3+4 = 10.
                Then cost(m) = (3+1)*(4-2) + (3 - 10) = 4*2 + (-7) = 8-7 = 1? 

          But what is the cost? 
                base = (m+1)*L - S1 = 4*4 - 10 = 16-10=6.
                The array d_i: 
                    for A_i<=3: d_i = A_i-4 -> [1-4, 2-4, 3-4, 4?] -> wait, A_i=4: then A_i>m? -> d_i = 4-3=1? 
                Actually: 
                    i=0: A_i=1 -> d_i = 1-4 = -3
                    i=1: A_i=2 -> d_i = 2-4 = -2
                    i=2: A_i=3 -> d_i = 3-4 = -1
                    i=3: A_i=4 -> d_i = 4-3 = 1
                Then the two smallest d_i: -3 and -2 -> sum = -5.
                Then total cost = base + (-5) = 6 -5 = 1.

          And our formula: 1.

          Now, if we use the formula for K<=L: 
                cost(m)= (m+1)*(r-K) + (P[K]-P[r]) = 4*(4-2) + (3-10) = 8 -7 = 1.

          For K>L: 
                Example: K=3, m=2: then L = number of A_i<=2 = 2 (which is <3). 
                Then cost(m)= S2_{K-L} - (K-L)*m = S2_{1} - 1*2.
                S2_{1}: the smallest A_i in part2? Part2: A_i>2 -> [3,4]. The smallest is 3.
                Then cost = 3 - 2 = 1.

          But let's compute:
                base = (m+1)*L - S1 = 3*2 - (1+2) = 6-3=3.
                d_i: 
                    A_i=1: d_i = 1-3 = -2
                    A_i=2: d_i = 2-3 = -1
                    A_i=3: d_i = 3-2 = 1
                    A_i=4: d_i = 4-2 = 2
                Then the 3 smallest: -2, -1, 1 -> sum = -2.
                Then total cost = 3 + (-2) = 1.

          And our formula: for K>L: S2_{1} = 3 -> 3 - 1*2 = 1.

          Therefore, the formula:

            Let B = sorted(A)
            Precompute prefix sum P[0..n]: P[0]=0, P[i]=B[0]+...+B[i-1] for i>=1.

            Then for a given m:

                r = number of elements <= m = upper_bound(B, m) - B.begin()   [if we use C++ terms: the first index where B[i] > m]

                Then:
                  if K <= r:
                      cost(m) = (m+1)*(r-K) + (P[K] - P[r])
                  if K > r:
                      s = K - r   [number we need from part2]
                      We need the s smallest elements in the part2? which are the next s elements after the first r? 
                      Then S2_s = P[r+s] - P[r]   [because the s smallest in part2 are the next s in the sorted array: from index r to r+s-1]

                      cost(m) = (P[r+s] - P[r]) - s * m

          Then we wish to minimize cost(m) over m in [0, T-1] (if K<N) or for K=0 we also do this.

          But note: m is an integer in [0, T-1]. However, the function cost(m) is piecewise linear? And the breakpoints are the integers that are in the set of A_i? 

          Therefore, we can consider candidate m:

            Candidate 1: m in the set of A_i? 
            Candidate 2: m = 0, m = T-1? 

          Actually, the function cost(m) is linear in m between the breakpoints? 

          Specifically, when m is in [a, b) (where a and b are consecutive integers in the set of distinct A_i? Actually, the breakpoints are at the integers? But note: the value of r (the count of A_i<=m) only changes when m crosses an A_i? 

          Therefore, we can consider candidate m that are:

            m = 0, m = T-1, and m = A_i, m = A_i - 1? 

          Actually, the minimal value of a linear piecewise function over integers is achieved at the breakpoints? The breakpoints are the integers where the value of r changes? 

          But note: r changes at m = each distinct value in A? 

          Therefore, we can iterate over the distinct values of A? There are at most 100,000. 

          However, we also need to consider m=0 and m=T-1? 

          Algorithm for K<N:

            Step 1: 
                Sort A, and compute prefix sums P[0..n] (n = N).

            Step 2:
                Collect candidate m: 
                   m = 0
                   m = T-1   (if T>=1)
                   m = each distinct value a in A (if a <= T-1) 
                   m = each distinct value a in A minus 1 (if a-1 >=0 and a-1<=T-1)   [because when m = a-1, then the next breakpoint is at a]

                Why a-1? Because the function r(m) is constant on [a_i, a_{i+1}-1]. But the expression for cost(m) is linear in m? So the minimal in the interval [a_i, a_{i+1}-1] is at an endpoint? 

            Then, for each candidate m, compute:

                r = the number of elements in A <= m -> we can use binary search in the sorted array A.

                Then:
                  if K <= r:
                      cost = (m+1)*(r-K) + (P[K] - P[r])
                  else:  # K>r
                      s = K - r
                      If r+s > n: then skip? because we don't have enough elements? Actually, r+s = K, and K<=N? so r+s<=N? 
                      But what if r+s>n? then we cannot take s elements from part2? -> then this m is invalid? 

                      Actually, we have r = number of elements <=m, so the rest is n - r. We need s = K - r, so we require s <= n - r -> K <= n? which is given. 

                Then cost = (P[r+s] - P[r]) - s * m

            Then take the minimal cost.

          But note: we must also consider that for a fixed m, we require that the R group is in [m+1, T]? But we have ensured m in [0, T-1] so m+1<=T? 

          Also, what if for some candidate m, we have r+s > n? 
                r+s = r + (K - r) = K <= n? So it's always <= n? 

          Therefore, we can compute for every candidate m.

          However, we have about O(n) candidates? n=100,000 -> acceptable.

          But note: distinct values of A: at most 100,000, and then we add 0 and T-1? So total candidates about 200,000? Then for each candidate, we do a binary search for r? and then use the prefix sum? 

          Actually, we can precompute the distinct values and then for each candidate, we can get r from the sorted array? 

          Alternatively, we can iterate over the distinct values of A and also the values a-1? and then 0 and T-1? 

          Steps:

            candidates = set()
            candidates.add(0)
            if T>=1: 
                candidates.add(T-1)
            for a in A:
                if a <= T-1:
                    candidates.add(a)
                if a-1 >=0 and a-1<=T-1:
                    candidates.add(a-1)

            Then sort the list of candidates.

            For each candidate m in the sorted list:

                r = number of A_i <= m: we can use a Fenwick tree? But we can precompute by sorting the candidates and then using two pointers? 

          Actually, we can sort the candidates and then iterate in increasing order. As we move m from low to high, r increases. 

          Algorithm:

            Let M = sorted(candidates)   # the candidate m values

            Sort A.

            Precompute an array for the distinct candidates and then use binary search to compute r for each candidate? 

            Since the total number of candidates is O(n), we can for each candidate m do:

                r = upper_bound(A, m)   # returns the first index in A (sorted) that is > m, so the count is that index? 

            Then compute cost(m) as above.

          Then answer = min(cost(m) for all candidate m)

          Then if we found no candidate? (but we have at least 0) then we take the min.

          Finally, if we found a candidate with minimal cost, that's the answer.

          But note: what if T=0? Then we skip the entire candidate iteration? We already handled T=0: 
                if T==0:
                    if K==N: return 0
                    else: return -1

          Therefore, the overall algorithm:

            if T == 0:
                if K == N: 
                    cost = 0
                else:
                    cost = -1   (impossible)

            else if K == N:
                cost = 0

            else:   # 0<=K<=N-1
                Sort A
                Precompute prefix sum P[0..n] for the sorted A: 
                    P[0]=0
                    P[i] = A[0]+...+A[i-1]   for i=1..n

                candidates = set()
                candidates.add(0)

                        candidates.add(a-1)

                best = a very large number (e.g., 10**18)

                For each m in candidates:
                    # Compute r = number of elements in A that are <= m
                    # We can use bisect_right: in Python, bisect_right(A, m) returns the insertion position, which is the number of elements <= m? 
                    # Actually, bisect_right(A, m) returns the index of the first element > m, which is the count of elements <= m? 
                    r = bisect.bisect_right(A, m)   # gives the count of elements <= m

                    if K <= r:

                        # But note: P[K] is the sum of the first K elements? 
                        # However, the first K elements are the smallest K? 
                        # But what if K-th element is > m? Then we cannot use the first K? 
                        # Actually, we require the K smallest that are <=m? But the first K elements are the smallest? and if the K-th element is <=m? 
                        # However, in the condition K<=r, we have at least K elements <=m? Then the first K elements are all <=m? 
                        # Therefore, the K smallest elements that are <=m are the first K? 
                        c = (m+1)*(r-K) + (P[K] - P[r])
                    else: 
                        s = K - r

                        # But we require r+s <= n? 
                        if r+s > n:
                            # This should not happen? because K<=n, and r+s=K, so <=n.
                            c = a big number? but skip? 
                        else:

                    if c < best:
                        best = c

                Then answer = best

          But wait: the third sample: 
                "2 1 1
                 0 0"
                T=1, K=1, N=2, A=[0,0]

            candidates: 
                m=0 -> candidate
                m = T-1 = 0 -> same.
                for a=0: 
                    a<=T-1? T-1=0 -> yes -> candidate 0
                    a-1 = -1 -> skip.

                So only candidate m=0.

            Then for m=0:
                r = number of A_i<=0 = 2? 
                Then K=1 <= r=2 -> 
                    cost = (0+1)*(2-1) + (P[1]-P[2]) 
                    P[0]=0, P[1]=0 (the first element is A[0]=0), P[2]=0+0=0.
                    = 1*(1) + (0-0) = 1.

            Then answer=1 -> which matches.

          The first sample: 
                "4 2 4
                 1 2 3 4"
                T=4, K=2, A=[1,2,3,4]

            candidates: 
                0, T-1=3
                a=1: candidates: 1, 0 -> but 0 already, so add 1.
                a=2: candidates: 2, 1 -> 1 already, so add 2.
                a=3: candidates: 3, 2 -> 2 already, 3 already (from T-1)
                a=4: skip? because 4>3? and 4-1=3 -> already.

                candidates = {0,1,2,3}

            Then we try:

                m=0: 
                    r = count(A_i<=0) = 0
                    K=2>0 -> s=2, then c = (P[0+2]-P[0]) - 2*0 = (P[2] - P[0]) = (1+2) - 0 = 3

                m=1:
                    r = count(A_i<=1) = 1
                    K=2>1 -> s=1, then c = (P[1+1] - P[1]) - 1*1 = ( (1+2) - (1) ) - 1 = (3-1) -1 = 1

                m=2:
                    r = count(A_i<=2) = 2
                    K=2<=2 -> c = (2+1)*(2-2) + (P[2]-P[2]) = 0 + (3-3)=0

                m=3:
                    r = count(A_i<=3)=3
                    K=2<=3 -> c = (3+1)*(3-2) + (P[2]-P[3]) = 4*1 + (3 - (1+2+3)) = 4 + (3-6)=4-3=1

            Then min(c)=0 -> which matches.

          The second sample:
                "4 2 4
                 1 2 2 4"

            candidates: 
                m=0, m=3
                a=1: candidates: 1,0
                a=2: candidates: 2,1
                a=2: same
                a=4: skip? 
                So candidates: {0,1,2,3}

            A sorted: [1,2,2,4]
            P[0]=0, P[1]=1, P[2]=1+2=3, P[3]=1+2+2=5, P[4]=1+2+2+4=9

            Try:
                m=0: r=0 -> s=2: c = P[2]-P[0] - 2*0 = 3
                m=1: r=1 -> s=1: c = (P[1+1]-P[1]) - 1*1 = (3-1) -1 = 1
                m=2: r=3 -> K=2<=3: c = (2+1)*(3-2) + (P[2]-P[3]) = 3*1 + (3-5)=3-2=1
                m=3: r=3 (because 4>3? so count=3) -> same as m=2: c = (3+1)*(3-2) + (P[2]-P[3]) = 4+ (3-5)=4-2=2

            Then min(c)=1 -> matches.

          The fourth sample: 
                "2 1 0
                 0 0"

            We already handled T=0: then K=1 < N=2 -> output -1.

          Therefore, code:

            if T==0:
                if K == N:
                    print(0)
                else:
                    print(-1)
            else:
                if K == N:
                    print(0)
                else:
                    # sort A
                    A.sort()
                    n = len(A)
                    # Precompute prefix sum P[0..n+1] (0-indexed: P[0]=0, P[1]=A[0], P[2]=A[0]+A[1], ...)
                    P = [0]*(n+1)
                    for i in range(1, n+1):
                        P[i] = P[i-1] + A[i-1]

                    candidates = set()
                    candidates.add(0)
                    if T-1 >= 0:
                        candidates.add(T-1)
                    for a in A:
                        if a <= T-1:
                            candidates.add(a)
                        if a-1 >=0 and a-1<=T-1:
                            candidates.add(a-1)

                    best = 10**18
                    for m in candidates:
                        # Count r: number of elements <= m
                        # We can use bisect_right: returns the insertion position? 
                        # In Python: bisect_right(A, m) returns the index at which m would be inserted to maintain sorted order? 
                        # Actually, bisect_right returns the insertion position which is the index after the last element <=m? 
                        # So the count r = bisect_right(A, m)   [because the indices [0, r-1] are <=m? so r elements? 
                        r = bisect.bisect_right(A, m)   # gives the count of elements <= m

                        if K <= r:
                            # cost = (m+1)*(r-K) + (P[K] - P[r])
                            cost_val = (m+1)*(r-K) + (P[K] - P[r])
                        else:
                            s = K - r
                            if r+s > n: 
                                # This should not happen? because r+s = K <= n? 
                                cost_val = 10**18
                            else:
                                # The next s elements: from index r to r+s-1? 
                                # Their sum = P[r+s] - P[r]
                                cost_val = (P[r+s] - P[r]) - s * m

                        if cost_val < best:
                            best = cost_val

                    print(best)

          However, note: the problem constraints: N up to 100,000, and we iterate over at most 200,000 candidates? So it is acceptable.

          But note: the candidate set might have duplicates? We use a set.

          Let me test the third sample: 
                "2 1 1
                 0 0" -> we did above: got 1.

          But the sample input: 
                "2 1 1
                 0 0" -> output 1.

          Therefore, we output the minimal cost.

          However, note: what if the minimal cost is negative? 

          But note: we are moving the arrival times arbitrarily? The cost is absolute? So it must be nonnegative? 

          Let me check:

            The formula for K<=r: 
                (m+1)*(r-K) + (P[K]-P[r])

                Since r>=K, and P[K] is the sum of the first K elements, and P[r] is the sum of the first r elements? So P[K] <= P[r]? because the next r-K elements are nonnegative? Then (P[K]-P[r]) is negative? but multiplied by ...? 

                Example: [1,2,3,4] with m=3, K=2: 
                    (3+1)*(4-2) + ( (1+2) - (1+2+3+4) ) = 4*2 + (3-10)=8-7=1>0.

            For K>r: 
                (P[r+s]-P[r]) - s * m

                P[r+s]-P[r] is the sum of s elements that are > m? so each element is at least m+1? so the sum is at least s*(m+1). Then the expression is at least s*(m+1) - s*m = s>0.

          Therefore, the cost is nonnegative? 

          But what about the first sample: m=0: 
                [1,2,3,4]: 
                    r=0, K=2>0 -> s=2: cost = (P[0+2]-P[0]) - 2*0 = (1+2) - 0 = 3.

          So it is nonnegative.

          Therefore, we output the minimal cost.

          One more sample: 
                "2 1 0
                 0 0" -> T=0 -> we output -1.

          But the sample input: 
                "2 1 0
                 0 0" -> output -1.

          And the sample: 
                "2 1 1
                 0 0" -> output 1.

          The sample: 
                "2 1 0" -> but T=0, so output -1.

          However, the problem says: 
                "2 1 0
                 0 0" -> output -1.

          But the sample input: 
                "2 1 0
                 0 0" -> as above.

          Therefore, we are done.

          However, note: we might have T-1 negative? Then we skip adding T-1? 

          We added: if T-1>=0.

          And for a in A: we skip if a-1<0.

          This should be safe.

          Let me test T=0: then we skip the entire else branch? and use the T==0 branch.

          What if T=1? Then T-1=0 -> we add 0.

          Code:

            import bisect

            n, K, T = map(int, input().split())
            A = list(map(int, input().split()))

            if T == 0:
                if K == n:
                    print(0)
                else:
                    print(-1)
            else:
                if K == n:
                    print(0)
                else:
                    A.sort()
                    P = [0]*(n+1)
                    for i in range(1, n+1):
                        P[i] = P[i-1] + A[i-1]

                    candidates = set()
                    candidates.add(0)
                    if T-1 >= 0:
                        candidates.add(T-1)
                    for a in A:
                        if a <= T-1:
                            candidates.add(a)
                        if a-1 >= 0 and a-1<=T-1:
                            candidates.add(a-1)

                    best = 10**18
                    for m in candidates:
                        r = bisect.bisect_right(A, m)   # number of elements <= m
                        if K <= r:
                            cost_val = (m+1)*(r-K) + (P[K] - P[r])
                        else:
                            s = K - r
                            if r+s > n:
                                cost_val = 10**18
                            else:
                                cost_val = (P[r+s] - P[r]) - s * m

                        if cost_val < best:
                            best = cost_val

                    print(best)

          But note: the problem says that the cost is an integer? because we move by integer seconds? 

          This matches.

          However, note: the problem constraints: T up to 1e9, and n up to 100000. The candidate set size is about 200000. This runs in O(n log n) due to sorting A and the candidate set? 

          The bisect_right for each candidate: we can do it in O(log n) per candidate? Then total O(200000 * log(100000)) ~ 2e5 * 17 = 3.4e6, which is acceptable.

          But note: we are also iterating over the candidate set and the candidate set is 200000, and for each we do a constant time operation? 

          So we can do.

          However, we can avoid the candidate set? 

          Alternative: iterate over the distinct values of A and the distinct values of A-1, and also 0 and T-1? 

          We did that.

          Let me run the sample: 
                "4 2 4
                 1 2 3 4" -> we had candidates [0,1,2,3] -> and we computed for each.

          Therefore, we output the code.

          But note: what if T is very large? Then we only have candidates that are 0, T-1, and the A_i and A_i-1. The number of candidates is at most 2*n+2, which is 200,002 for n=100000 -> acceptable.

          Therefore, we are done.

          One more corner: what if T-1 is very large? But we only store the integer, which is acceptable.

          We'll code accordingly.

          However, note: the problem says T can be up to 1e9? and we store T-1? That is an integer of size 1e9? which is acceptable.

          Therefore, the solution.

          Let me test with a small case: 
                N=1, K=0, T=10, A=[5]

            Then we require: 
                T>0, K=0 -> we use the else branch.

            candidates: 
                0, T-1=9, 
                a=5: add 5 and 4.

            candidates = {0,4,5,9}

            Then for each candidate m:

                m=0: 
                    r = number of A_i<=0? =0
                    K=0<=0 -> 
                         cost = (0+1)*(0-0) + (P[0]-P[0]) = 0? 
                    But let me compute: 
                        We assign the subordinate to R? 
                        For m=0: 
                            The R group must be in [1,10]? 
                            We set x_i to max(0, 1) = 1? cost |1-5|=4? 
                        But our formula: 
                            For the subordinate: if in R: cost = max(0, 0+1 - 5) = max(0,1-5)=0? because if A_i>=m+1? 
                            Actually: A_i=5, which is >=1? so we set x_i=5? cost=0? 

                    Then why our formula for K<=r? 
                        Here, K=0, r=0: 
                            cost = (0+1)*(0-0) + (P[0]-P[0]) = 0.

                    How is that consistent? 

                    In the derivation, we had:

                        base = sum_i max(0, m+1 - A_i) = max(0,1-5)=0.
                        Then we choose L: size 0 -> so the sum of the 0 smallest d_i = 0.
                        Then total cost=0.

                    But wait: we are allowed to leave the subordinate at 5? Then we set S in (0,1)? Then the subordinate is not present? So K=0? and cost=0.

                    Therefore, it is correct.

            Then the answer=0? 

            But note: the problem: we require that the subordinate does not arrive strictly before the boss (0) -> 5>=0, and not strictly later than T=10 -> 5<=10. So we don't need to move.

            Therefore, 0 is correct.

          Another: 
                N=1, K=0, T=10, A=[0]
                Then we must move the subordinate? 
                    We cannot leave at 0? because then at any S>0, the subordinate is present? 
                    We must move to at least 1? cost=1.

                candidates: 
                    m in {0,9,0, (0-1=-1 skip)} -> {0,9}

                m=0: 
                    r = count(A_i<=0)=1
                    K=0<=1 -> 
                        cost = (0+1)*(1-0) + (P[0]-P[1]) 
                        P[0]=0, P[1]=0 (the first element is 0)
                        = 1*1 + (0-0) = 1.

                m=9: 
                    r = count(A_i<=9)=1
                    cost = (9+1)*(1-0) + (P[0]-P[1]) = 10 + (0-0)=10.

                Then minimal cost=1.

          Correct.

          Therefore, the solution.

          Note: we must use integer arithmetic.

          We output the code accordingly.

          However, note: the problem says that the same subordinate can be adjusted multiple times? But we are moving to an integer value? and the cost is |x_i - A_i|? which we computed.

          Therefore, we are done.

          Let's code accordingly.

          But note: the problem constraints: n, K, T and A as given.

          We'll write the code in the required language? But the problem says to write an editorial without code? 

          But we have provided the detailed reasoning and the algorithm.

          Summary:

            if T == 0:
                if K == N: 
                    print(0)
                else:
                    print(-1)
            else:
                if K == N:
                    print(0)
                else:
                    Sort the array A of N integers.
                    Precompute prefix sums P[0..N] for the sorted array: 
                         P[0] = 0
                         P[i] = A[0] + A[1] + ... + A[i-1] for i=1..N

                    candidates = set()
                    candidates.add(0)
                    candidates.add(T-1)
                    For each a in A:
                         if a <= T-1: add a to candidates
                         if a-1 >= 0 and a-1<=T-1: add a-1 to candidates

                    best = a big number (like 10**18)
                    For each candidate m in candidates:
                         r = bisect_right(A, m)   # which is the number of elements <= m
                         if K <= r:
                             cost_val = (m+1) * (r - K) + (P[K] - P[r])
                         else:
                             s = K - r
                             if r+s > N:  # This should not happen, but for safety, skip by setting to big number.
                                 cost_val = big_number
                             else:
                                 cost_val = (P[r+s] - P[r]) - s * m

                         best = min(best, cost_val)

                    print(best)

          This is the solution.

          Time complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting and iterating over O(n) candidates with binary search per candidate.

          Memory: O(n).

          We are done.
