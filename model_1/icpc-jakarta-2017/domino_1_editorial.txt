### Editorial: Constructing a Forest with Minimum Trees

#### Problem Analysis
The problem involves constructing a forest (a collection of trees) from \(N\) given tuples \((u_i, v_i, w_i)\) such that seven specific requirements are met. The key requirements are:
1. Each tree is rooted.
2. Each node \(x\) has a value \(x.A\).
3. Each edge \((x, y)\) has a value \((x, y).B\).
4. Each tuple \((u_i, v_i, w_i)\) corresponds to a parent-child edge where the parent node has \(A = u_i\), the child node has \(A = v_i\), and the edge has \(B = w_i\).
5. For any internal node (non-root and non-leaf), the weight of the edge from its parent is smaller than the weights of all edges to its children.
6. No node has more than \(M\) children.
7. The forest contains exactly \(N\) edges.

The goal is to minimize the number of trees in the forest while satisfying all constraints. The solution must efficiently handle large inputs (up to \(N = 100,000\)).

#### Key Insight
The critical observation is that the unique edge weights and the requirement that parent edges must be smaller than child edges (for internal nodes) allow processing edges in increasing order of weights. This ensures that when attaching an edge to an existing node, the weight condition is automatically satisfied because the existing node was created by an edge with a lower weight. 

#### Algorithmic Approach
1. **Sort Edges by Weight**: Process edges in increasing order of \(w_i\). This leverages the unique weights and the increasing weight requirement downward in the trees.
2. **Track Available Slots**: Maintain a dictionary (or hash map) `slots` where `slots[a]` represents the total number of available child slots for all nodes with value \(A = a\). Each node can have up to \(M\) children, so when a node is created, it contributes \(M\) slots (or \(M - 1\) if it's a root with one child already).
3. **Process Each Edge**:
   - For an edge \((u, v, w)\):
     - If there is an available slot for a node with \(A = u\) (i.e., `slots[u] > 0`), use one slot to attach this edge. This means:
       - Decrement `slots[u]` by 1.
       - The child node (with \(A = v\)) is created, adding \(M\) slots to `slots[v]`.
     - If no slot is available for \(u\), start a new tree (increment the tree count) by making this edge a root edge. This creates:
       - A root node (with \(A = u\)) that can have \(M - 1\) more children (so add \(M - 1\) to `slots[u]`).
       - A child node (with \(A = v\)) that adds \(M\) slots to `slots[v]`.
4. **Output the Tree Count**: The total number of trees created (root edges) is the answer.

#### Why This Approach Works
- **Weight Condition**: Processing edges in increasing order ensures that any existing node has an incoming edge weight (or 0 for roots) less than the current edge's weight, satisfying requirement 5.
- **Slot Management**: The dictionary `slots` aggregates available slots per node value, efficiently tracking capacity without managing individual nodes. Using a slot decrements capacity, and adding new nodes increments capacity for their \(A\) values.
- **Minimizing Trees**: By attaching edges to existing nodes whenever possible, the algorithm minimizes the number of new trees (root edges), which is optimal.
- **Complexity**: Sorting \(N\) edges takes \(O(N \log N)\) time. Processing each edge involves \(O(1)\) dictionary operations, leading to \(O(N)\) time for the loop. The space complexity is \(O(N)\) for the dictionary.

#### Solution Code
```python
import sys
from collections import defaultdict

def main():
    data = sys.stdin.read().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    m_val = int(data[1])
    edges = []
    index = 2
    for i in range(n):
        u = int(data[index])
        v = int(data[index + 1])
        w = int(data[index + 2])
        index += 3
        edges.append((u, v, w))
    
    edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])
    
    trees = 0
    slots = defaultdict(int)
    
    for u, v, w in edges:
        if slots[u] > 0:
            slots[u] -= 1
            slots[v] += m_val
        else:
            trees += 1
            slots[u] += m_val - 1
            slots[v] += m_val
    
    print(trees)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### Explanation of Sample Cases
1. **Sample 1**: Input \(N=5, M=2\) with edges sorted by weight: \((4,7,1)\), \((4,8,2)\), \((2,4,3)\), \((7,2,4)\), \((4,4,5)\). The algorithm creates 2 trees:
   - Edge \((4,7,1)\) starts tree 1 (root). Slots: `[4:1, 7:2]`.
   - Edge \((4,8,2)\) attaches to node \(4\). Slots: `[4:0, 7:2, 8:2]`.
   - Edge \((2,4,3)\) starts tree 2 (root). Slots: `[2:1, 4:2, 7:2, 8:2]`.
   - Edge \((7,2,4)\) attaches to node \(7\). Slots: `[2:3, 4:2, 7:1, 8:2]`.
   - Edge \((4,4,5)\) attaches to node \(4\). Slots: `[2:3, 4:3, 7:1, 8:2]`.
   - Output: 2 trees.

2. **Sample 2**: Same edges but \(M=1\). The algorithm creates 3 trees because nodes can have at most one child, limiting attachments and requiring more roots.

3. **Sample 3**: Input \(N=5, M=10\). All edges attach to existing nodes, resulting in 1 tree, as \(M\) is large enough to avoid new trees.

This approach efficiently constructs the forest while minimizing trees and adhering to all constraints.
