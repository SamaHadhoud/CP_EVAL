### Editorial
The problem involves reconstructing Romanos' guesses in a number guessing game where Theodora provides answers that maximize the remaining range of possible numbers. Romanos makes up to \( K \) guesses, and Theodora's answers are given. The goal is to determine a sequence of guesses consistent with the answers or conclude that it's impossible.

#### Key Insight
The solution requires simulating the game step-by-step while ensuring that each guess is consistent with the current range of possible numbers and Theodora's adversarial strategy. Theodora's answers are predetermined: for a guess \( g \) in the current interval \([L, R]\), she chooses the answer that leaves the largest possible range, breaking ties by choosing "\(<\)". 

#### Algorithm Selection
1. **Precompute Minimum Interval Sizes**: For each position in the answer string, compute the minimal size of the interval required to accommodate the remaining answers. This ensures that after each guess, the updated interval can support subsequent answers.
2. **Simulate the Game**: 
   - Start with the initial interval \([1, N]\).
   - For each answer, choose a guess within the current interval that:
     - Satisfies Theodora's answer (i.e., forces her to give the provided answer).
     - Ensures the updated interval is non-empty and large enough for the remaining answers.
   - Update the interval based on the answer.

#### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(K) \), as we process each answer once and each step involves constant-time operations (using integer arithmetic).
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(K) \), to store the precomputed minimal sizes and the output guesses.

#### Solution Explanation
1. **Precomputation**:
   - Initialize an array `min_size` where `min_size[M] = 0` (after processing all answers).
   - Traverse the answer string backwards:
     - For "=" at position \( i \), set `min_size[i] = 1` (the interval must be a singleton).
     - For "<" or ">" at the last position (\( i = M-1 \)), set `min_size[i] = 2` (requires at least two numbers).
     - For other positions, set `min_size[i] = min_size[i+1] + 1` (each non-final answer reduces the interval by at least one number).

2. **Simulation**:
   - Start with \( L = 1 \), \( R = N \), and an empty list for guesses.
   - For each answer \( s_i \) in the string:
     - If the current interval size \( (R - L + 1) \) is less than `min_size[i]`, output `-1`.
     - For "=":
        - If \( L \neq R \), output `-1` (must be a singleton).
        - Otherwise, guess \( L \) (or \( R \)) and end the game.
     - For "<":
        - Compute the lower bound for the guess: \( \text{low\_bound} = \max(\lceil (L + R)/2 \rceil, L + \text{min\_size}[i+1]) \) (or \( L + 1 \) for the last answer).
        - If \( \text{low\_bound} > R \), output `-1`.
        - Guess \( \text{low\_bound} \), update \( R = \text{guess} - 1 \).
     - For ">":
        - Compute the upper bound: \( \text{high\_bound} = \min(\lfloor (L + R - 1)/2 \rfloor, R - \text{min\_size}[i+1]) \) (or \( R - 1 \) for the last answer).
        - If \( \text{high\_bound} < L \), output `-1`.
        - Guess \( \text{high\_bound} \), update \( L = \text{guess} + 1 \).
   - Output the sequence of guesses.

#### Correctness
The solution ensures:
- **Consistency**: Each guess is within the current interval and matches Theodora's provided answer.
- **Adversarial Play**: Theodora's answers maximize the remaining range as per her strategy.
- **Feasibility**: The precomputed `min_size` ensures the interval remains non-empty and sufficiently large for subsequent answers.
- **Termination**: The game ends with a correct guess or after \( K \) guesses, with the final interval non-empty in the latter case.

This approach efficiently handles the constraints by leveraging precomputation and greedy guess selection, ensuring correctness for all valid inputs.
