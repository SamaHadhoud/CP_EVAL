Okay, so I need to write an editorial for this problem. Let me start by understanding the problem myself. The problem is about constructing a forest with the minimum number of trees that satisfies seven specific requirements. The input gives N tuples (u_i, v_i, w_i), and I need to use each tuple exactly once to form edges in the forest. Each tree in the forest is rooted, and there are constraints on the values associated with nodes and edges.

First, let me restate the problem in simpler terms. We have to build a forest (a collection of trees) such that:

1. Each tree has a root.
2. Each node has a value A (so two different nodes might have the same A? But note the tuples use u_i and v_i which are node values, but actually, from the requirement, each tuple defines a parent-child relationship via the node values and the edge weight. But note: the tuple says u_i = p.A and v_i = c.A, meaning that the parent node has value u_i and the child node has value v_i. Also, the edge has weight w_i.

But here's a catch: the same node value might appear multiple times? Actually, the problem doesn't say that node values are unique. But looking at the tuples, we have (2,4,3), (4,4,5), (4,7,1), etc. So node value 4 appears multiple times. But in the forest, each node is a distinct entity. So we can have multiple nodes with the same A value? The requirement doesn't forbid that. However, in the forest, each node is a distinct object, so even if two nodes have the same A value, they are different nodes.

But requirement 4 says each tuple appears exactly once as a parent-child relationship. That means for a tuple (u, v, w), there is exactly one edge from a node with A=u (the parent) to a node with A=v (the child) and the edge has B=w.

So, we have N edges, each defined by one tuple. The forest must have exactly N edges, so it has N+1 nodes? Not necessarily: because there might be multiple nodes with the same A value. Actually, the forest will have exactly N edges, so the number of nodes is the number of distinct nodes we have. But the problem doesn't specify that the nodes are uniquely identified by A. So we have to consider that a node is defined by its A value? Or can multiple nodes have the same A? The requirement 4 says that each tuple appears exactly once. So if we have two tuples with the same u and v, but different w, then we must have two different edges: one from a node with A=u to a node with A=v with w1, and another from a node with A=u to a node with A=v with w2. But the parent and child nodes could be the same node? Or different? Since each node has a single parent (because it's a tree and forest), so each node (except roots) has exactly one parent.

But requirement 4 says "each tuple appears exactly once", meaning each tuple corresponds to one parent-child edge. So for each tuple, we have one edge. Therefore, the forest has N edges and hence the number of nodes is the number of distinct node identities we create. However, the problem does not force that nodes with the same A value are the same node. So we can create multiple nodes with the same A value.

But in the sample, we have a tuple (4,4,5): so a node with A=4 is the parent of another node with A=4. So we can have two nodes both with A=4: one is the parent of the other.

So the forest has N edges and hence (number of nodes) = (number of roots) + N. Because each edge adds one node? Actually, no: we start with roots and each edge adds one node? Wait, no: each edge connects two nodes. But the forest has multiple trees. The total number of nodes is the number of roots plus the number of edges? Actually, in any forest, the number of nodes = number of trees (roots) + number of edges. Because each tree: nodes = edges + 1. So total nodes = total edges + number of trees.

But the problem doesn't ask for the number of nodes, but the number of trees (i.e., the roots) in the forest.

Now, the constraints:

- Each non-root and non-leaf node (i.e., an internal node) must satisfy that the edge from its parent is smaller than any edge from it to its children. So for node x: if p is parent, and c1, c2, ... are children, then (p,x).B < (x, c_i).B for every child c_i.

- Also, each node can have at most M children.

- The forest must have exactly N edges.

- The w_i are unique (given).

The goal is to minimize the number of trees in the forest.

How do we approach this?

I recall that in graph problems with unique edge weights, we can often use sorting. Also, the requirement about the parent edge being smaller than all child edges suggests that edges with smaller weights must be higher in the tree (closer to the root) because the parent edge is smaller than the child edges.

Actually, for an internal node x, the incoming edge weight must be less than all outgoing edge weights. So if we consider the entire tree, the edge weights increase as we go down the tree.

Therefore, the tree is built from the root downward with increasing edge weights.

But note: the root has no incoming edge. So the root can have any outgoing edges? But the constraint only applies to non-root and non-leaf nodes. So the root doesn't have the constraint on the incoming edge, but if the root has children, then for each child, if that child becomes an internal node, then the edge from root to that child must be less than the edges from that child to its own children.

Moreover, the root itself can have multiple children, but the root is not constrained by the parent edge condition because it has no parent.

Similarly, a leaf has no children, so the condition doesn't apply to leaves.

So the entire forest must form a kind of increasing tree: from root downward, the edge weights increase.

But is it a chain? Not necessarily: a node can have multiple children. But the condition is only that the parent edge is smaller than each child edge. So if a node has multiple children, the child edges can be in any order relative to each other? But they must all be greater than the parent edge.

Now, to form the forest, we are given N edges (tuples). Each edge has a weight w_i, and the weights are unique and between 1 and N.

We need to assign each edge to a parent-child relationship. Also, we need to assign the nodes: each edge gives two node values: u_i for the parent's A and v_i for the child's A. But note: we can create multiple nodes with the same A value. So we are free to create as many nodes as needed, as long as the total edges are N.

But the forest must be built from the given edges. Each edge is used once.

The problem is: how to assign the edges to form trees such that the internal node condition holds and each node has at most M children, and we minimize the number of trees.

Minimizing the number of trees means we want as few roots as possible. So we want to connect as many edges as possible into trees.

So the problem reduces to: we have a set of edges with distinct weights. We want to arrange them in trees such that:

1. In any path from root to leaf, the edge weights are increasing (because each step down has a higher edge weight than the incoming edge to the current node? Actually, the condition is local: for each internal node, the incoming edge weight is less than all outgoing edge weights. This implies that along any downward path, the edge weights are increasing. Because if we have a path: root -> a -> b, then the edge root->a must be less than the edge a->b. So the entire path is increasing.

But note: a node might have multiple children. The condition doesn't force the children edges to be ordered among themselves, only that they are all greater than the incoming edge.

Now, we have to assign each edge to be either a root edge (then the parent is a root) or as a child of an existing node.

But we also have the node values: each edge specifies the A value of the parent and the A value of the child. However, we can have multiple nodes with the same A value. So we have to decide: for each edge, whether to use it to connect two nodes, and we can create nodes arbitrarily.

But the key is: we are forced to use the u_i and v_i as the A values for the parent and child, respectively.

So the problem is: we have a set of directed edges (from parent to child) with weight w_i, and we need to arrange them in trees satisfying the increasing condition and the out-degree constraint, and minimize the number of trees.

But note: the direction is inherent: parent to child. So we are building a directed forest (with edges directed from parent to child).

How do we form the trees? We start with roots. Each root must be a node that does not appear as a child in any edge? Actually, no: because we can have multiple nodes with the same A value. So a node that is a root in one tree might be a child in another? But wait: each node has exactly one parent? In a tree, each non-root node has exactly one parent. But if we have two nodes with the same A value, one can be a root and the other can be a child somewhere else. So the A values don't uniquely identify nodes.

Therefore, we can create nodes arbitrarily. The only constraints are:

- Each edge must be used exactly once.

- The edge weight condition for internal nodes.

- Each node has at most M children.

We want to minimize the number of trees (roots).

So how do we assign edges to trees? We need to connect edges. But note: if we have an edge e1: (u1, v1, w1) and an edge e2: (u2, v2, w2), they can be connected if the parent of e2 is the child of e1? Only if they share the same node? But the node must have the same A value? Actually, no: because the node is defined by its A value? Or not? The problem says: the node has a value A. So when we create a node, we set its A value. But in the edge, we specify the parent's A and the child's A. So for edge e1, we create two nodes: one with A=u1 (parent) and one with A=v1 (child). For edge e2: if we want to attach it to the child of e1, then we need that the parent of e2 is the same as the child of e1? But the child of e1 has A = v1, and the parent of e2 has A = u2. So for them to be the same node, we require that v1 == u2? And we can set that node to have A = v1 (which is also u2). So we can chain them only if the child A of the first edge equals the parent A of the next edge.

But note: we are allowed to create multiple nodes with the same A value. So we don't have to merge nodes with the same A value. We can choose to merge or not? Actually, no: when we create a node for an edge, we are setting its A value. But if we have two edges that we want to connect, we must use the same node for the child of the first and the parent of the second. Therefore, we can only connect edge e1: (u1, v1, w1) and e2: (u2, v2, w2) if v1 == u2, and we decide that the node with A=v1 (which is the child of e1) is the same node as the parent of e2 (which has A=u2). So the A values must be equal to share the node.

Therefore, the problem becomes: we have edges that are directed from a node with A=u to a node with A=v. We can connect two edges if the child node of the first edge has the same A value as the parent node of the second edge. Then, we can form a chain: edge1: u1 -> v1, then edge2: u2=v1 -> v2, and so on.

But also, we can have multiple children: so a node can have multiple outgoing edges, each to a different child.

But the constraint is: the incoming edge weight to a node must be less than all outgoing edge weights from that node. And also, the out-degree of each node cannot exceed M.

Moreover, the entire structure must form trees (so no cycles, and connected from the root).

Given that, how to minimize the number of trees? Each tree must have a root, which has no incoming edge.

So we want to minimize the roots. That means we want to use as many edges as possible as non-root edges, i.e., having an incoming edge from a parent.

But which edges can be roots? Any edge can be a root? But the root edge has no incoming edge to the parent. So the parent node of a root edge is a root. But we don't have an edge pointing to that parent.

So every root node must appear as a parent in at least one edge, but never as a child? Actually, no: a root node is one that has no parent. So in the set of edges, the root node's A value must appear as a u_i in at least one edge (if the root has children) and must not appear as a v_j in any edge that we use to assign a parent to it? But since we can have multiple nodes with the same A, we can have a root node that has A = x, and there might be other edges where v_i = x (meaning they are pointing to a node with A=x), but that node is a different node (with the same A value). So the root node does not have to be unique in terms of A value, and the fact that there is an edge with v_i = x doesn't force that our root node has a parent.

Therefore, we can create a root node with A = x even if there are edges that have v_i = x. Those edges would be attached to other nodes (with the same A value) that are not roots.

So the problem is: we have a set of edges. Each edge has (u, v, w). We need to form trees. The trees are built by:

- Choosing some edges to be root edges: these edges have a parent node that is a root (and so that parent node has no incoming edge).

- Then, we can attach edges to existing nodes if the parent A of the new edge matches the child A of the existing edge's node? Actually, when we attach an edge to an existing node, that node must have been created by a previous edge as a child. The new edge will use that node as the parent. So the new edge must have u = the A value of that node.

But since the same A value can appear in multiple nodes, we have to decide which node to attach to.

Moreover, the constraint on the weights: for a node that is not a root and not a leaf (so it has both a parent and at least one child), the weight of the incoming edge must be less than the weights of all outgoing edges.

So for a node, if we have an incoming edge with weight w_in and multiple outgoing edges with weights w_out1, w_out2, ..., then we must have w_in < w_out_i for every i.

Also, the out-degree of the node must be at most M.

To minimize the number of trees (roots), we want as many edges as possible to be attached to existing nodes. But we have to satisfy the weight condition.

How can we model this?

I recall that in problems like this, we can think of the edges as having to be arranged in an order that respects the increasing condition. Specifically, for a node, the incoming edge must be the smallest edge incident to it? Actually, not exactly: the incoming edge must be smaller than all outgoing edges. But the node might have multiple outgoing edges, all greater than the incoming edge.

Moreover, the same node can have multiple outgoing edges, so we can attach multiple edges to one node, as long as the weights are greater than the incoming edge and we don't exceed M children.

But the incoming edge is fixed for a node. How do we assign edges to nodes?

Actually, each edge creates two nodes: but we can share nodes when the A values match. So we have to decide how to assign the edges to form the forest.

Alternatively, we can think of the entire structure as an assignment of edges to trees and to positions in the trees, with the constraints.

But the problem is complex. Let me look for known solutions or similar problems. I recall that this problem is from ICPC Jakarta 2017, and the problem is called "Domino". The solution involves using a DSU or greedy with priority queues.

After some thought, a known approach is:

1. Sort the edges by weight (since the condition is about the weight order).

But note: the condition says that for a node, the incoming edge weight must be less than the outgoing edge weights. So if we process edges in increasing order of weight, then when we assign an edge as an outgoing edge of a node, the incoming edge of that node must have been assigned and have a smaller weight. Therefore, processing from low to high weight makes sense.

So we sort the edges by w_i (the weight) in increasing order.

Now, when we process an edge (u, v, w), we have to decide: either make it a root edge (so we start a new tree) or attach it as a child to an existing node.

To attach it to an existing node, we need a node that has been created and that has A value equal to u (because the parent's A must be u). Moreover, the node must have an incoming edge weight less than w (because the condition: if the node is not a root, then its incoming edge must be less than w; but if it is a root, then it has no incoming edge, so we can attach? However, the condition only applies to non-root and non-leaf nodes. If we attach an edge to a root, then that root becomes an internal node (if it wasn't a leaf already) and now has an incoming edge? Wait, no: the root has no incoming edge. When we attach an edge to a root, the root becomes the parent. The root itself is now having an outgoing edge. But the root doesn't have an incoming edge, so the condition for the root is only that if it has multiple children, then for each child, if that child becomes internal, then the edge from root to child must be less than the edges from child to its children. But for the root, there is no constraint that forces its outgoing edge to be greater than something? Actually, the constraint only applies to non-root nodes. So when we attach an edge to a root, the root might become an internal node (if it wasn't a leaf) but the constraint on the root is only the out-degree limit.

But for the child node we are creating: when we create the child node (with A=v), it has an incoming edge of weight w. Then, if later we attach an edge to this node (so with u = v), the weight of that new edge must be greater than w (because the condition for the node: the incoming edge w must be less than any outgoing edge). Therefore, we can only attach an edge to a node if the new edge's weight is greater than the incoming edge weight of that node.

Moreover, when we create a node by an edge, that node's incoming edge weight is the weight of that edge.

So the algorithm:

- Sort edges by w (weight) in increasing order.

- We maintain a data structure that allows us to find available nodes that we can attach new edges to. An available node is one that has been created (so by a previous edge) and that we can attach children to (so its out-degree is less than M) and that has an incoming edge weight less than the current edge's weight (so that the condition holds when we attach the new edge to it).

But also, the node must have A value equal to the current edge's u (because the parent's A value must be u).

So for the current edge (u, v, w), we can attach it to an available node with A value u and with incoming edge weight less than w, and that still has capacity (out-degree < M).

If we can find such a node, we attach the current edge to it. Then, we create a new node (the child) with A value v and incoming edge weight w. This new node will be available for future edges (if we set it as available) only if it has capacity? Actually, when we create a node, initially it has no children, so we can attach up to M children to it. So it is available until it has M children.

If we cannot find such a node, then we must make the current edge a root edge. That means we start a new tree. The parent node (with A=u) is a root (so no incoming edge). Then we create a child node (with A=v) with incoming edge weight w. The root node (A=u) now has one child. We can also make the root node available for future edges? But the root node has no incoming edge. So when we want to attach an edge to this root node, we require that the new edge's weight is greater than ...? But the root node has no incoming edge. The condition for the root node: when we attach a child to it, we don't have an incoming edge to compare. The constraint only says that for non-root nodes. So we can attach any edge to the root node as long as the root's out-degree is not full? However, note: if we attach an edge to the root node, then the root becomes an internal node? But the condition for the root node when it becomes internal: the condition is only for non-root nodes. The root node doesn't have the constraint that its outgoing edges must be greater than an incoming edge (because there is none). Therefore, we can attach edges to the root node regardless of the weight? But wait: the condition says "for any non-root and non-leaf node", so the root node is exempt from the incoming edge comparison. So we can attach an edge of any weight to the root node? However, the child node that we create will have an incoming edge (the edge we just attached). Then, if we later attach an edge to that child node, the new edge's weight must be greater than the incoming edge of that child.

But for the root node itself, we can attach multiple children in any order of weights? However, note: if we attach two edges to the root: one with weight 1 and then one with weight 2, that's fine. But what if we attach weight 2 first and then weight 1? Then the root has two children: one with incoming weight 2 and one with weight 1. That doesn't violate the root's condition because the root has no incoming edge. But now, the child with incoming weight 1: if we later attach an edge to it, that new edge must have weight > 1. But the edge with weight 2 is already attached to the root, so that's independent.

So the root node can have children with any weights, in any order? Yes, because the condition doesn't restrict the root node's outgoing edges.

Therefore, we can use the root node as an available node for attaching any edge (as long as out-degree < M). But we must remember that the root node has A value. So to attach an edge (u, v, w) to the root node, we require that the root node's A value is u. But when we create the root node by making an edge a root edge, we set the root node's A value to u (from the edge). Then, if we want to attach another edge to the same root node, that new edge must have u equal to the root node's A value.

So we have to group available nodes by their A value? Because when we want to attach an edge with parent A=u, we need an available node with A=u.

Therefore, we can maintain a data structure:

- A dictionary (or map) that maps a node value A to a collection of nodes (with that A value) that are available (i.e., they have been created, have out-degree less than M, and have an incoming edge weight less than ...? Actually, when we attach a new edge to a node, we require that the node's incoming edge weight is less than the new edge's weight? Only if the node is not a root? But for a root node, there is no incoming edge, so we don't require any condition? Actually, the condition for attaching to a root is only that the root's A value matches and it has capacity. We don't require that the new edge's weight is greater than the root's incoming edge (because there is none). However, for a non-root node, we require that the new edge's weight is greater than the node's incoming edge weight.

But note: the root node doesn't have an incoming edge weight. So when we attach an edge to a root, we don't have a weight to compare. Therefore, we can attach any edge to a root node (if A matches and capacity).

But for non-root nodes, we have the condition: the new edge's weight must be greater than the node's incoming edge weight.

So we can handle root nodes and non-root nodes differently? Or we can treat them uniformly: for a root node, we can consider its incoming edge weight as 0? Because any positive weight w is greater than 0. Then the condition would be: the new edge's weight > 0, which is always true. So we can set for root nodes, the incoming edge weight as 0. Then the condition for attaching an edge to any node (root or non-root) is: the new edge's weight must be greater than the node's incoming edge weight.

That simplifies the code.

Therefore, we can assign:

- For a root edge: when we use an edge to start a tree, we set the parent node as root, and we assign it an incoming edge weight of 0 (virtual). Then the child node gets the edge's weight as its incoming edge weight.

- For a non-root edge: the parent node already exists (with an incoming edge weight, say w_in) and we attach the new edge (with weight w) only if w > w_in.

Then, the algorithm:

- Sort all edges by weight w.

- We maintain a data structure: for each node value A, we have a collection (like a min-heap? or a set) of the incoming edge weights of the available nodes with that A value? But wait: we don't need the weights per se, because we require that the node's incoming weight is less than the current edge's weight. But since we process edges in increasing weight, any node that has been created so far has an incoming weight less than the current edge's weight? Actually, not necessarily: because we process in increasing weight, so all edges we've processed so far have weight <= current? But we process in increasing order, so all edges processed so far have weight less than or equal to the current? But the condition requires strictly less? Because w_in < w.

But if we process in increasing order, then when we process an edge of weight w, all previous edges have weight <= w? But we need the node's incoming weight to be less than w. So if a node was created by an edge of weight w0, and w0 < w, then we can attach. But if w0 == w, we cannot. But the weights are unique (given: w_i are distinct). So w0 < w is guaranteed if the edge that created the node was processed earlier? Because we sort by increasing w, and w0 is from a previous edge, so w0 < w. Therefore, if we process in increasing weight, then every node that has been created so far has an incoming weight less than the current edge's weight. So the condition w_in < w is automatically satisfied for all existing nodes.

Therefore, we don't need to check the weight condition explicitly: as long as we process edges in increasing order, any existing node (created by a previous edge) has incoming weight less than the current edge's weight. So we only need to check:

1. There is an available node with A value equal to the current edge's u.

2. That node still has capacity (out-degree < M).

If so, we can attach the current edge to that node.

Then, we update that node: we increase its out-degree by one. If the out-degree becomes M, then we remove it from the available data structure for A=u.

Also, we create a new node for the child: with A value = v, and incoming edge weight = w. This new node is initially available (out-degree=0). We add it to the available data structure for A=v.

If we cannot find an available node for A=u, then we must use the current edge as a root edge. Then, we create two nodes: the root node (A=u) and the child node (A=v). The root node: we set its incoming weight as 0 (virtual) and we set its out-degree as 1 (because it has one child). Since it has capacity? It now has one child. If M>=1, it can still have more children? So we add the root node to the available data structure for A=u? But note: the root node has an incoming weight of 0 (which is less than any future edge weight, since weights are at least 1). And it now has one child, so if M>1, it can have more. So we add it to the available set for A=u.

But we have to create the root node: but we don't have an incoming edge for it. So we set its state: A=u, incoming weight=0, out-degree=1. Then, if M>1, it is available to have more children.

Similarly, we create the child node: A=v, incoming weight=w, out-degree=0 -> so we add it to the available set for A=v.

Then, the number of trees (roots) we create is the number of times we choose to make an edge a root edge.

Therefore, the algorithm:

- Initialize:
  - trees = 0   (this will be the count of roots, but we don't need to count trees, we need to output the number of trees at the end)
  - Actually, we count the number of root edges we create. But each root edge starts one tree? But note: one tree can have multiple root edges? No: each tree has exactly one root. But the root node might have multiple children? But we start the tree with one root edge? Actually, the root edge is the first edge of the tree. Then we can attach more edges to the root. So each root edge corresponds to one tree? Not exactly: because if we have two root edges that share the same root node (same A value), then they are in the same tree. How?

Wait: when we make an edge a root edge, we create a root node with A=u. Then, if later we attach an edge to that same root node (because we have an edge with u equal to the root's A value), then that edge is in the same tree. So multiple root edges might be in the same tree? Actually, no: because each root edge creates a root node. But if we have two edges that we make root edges, both with the same u, then we create two separate root nodes? Because we create a new node for each root edge. So even if the A values are the same, we create two distinct root nodes (each with A=u). Then, each is a separate root.

Therefore, each time we make an edge a root edge, we create a new tree. So the total number of trees is the number of root edges we create.

But note: we might attach multiple edges to the same root node (if they have the same u and we use the same root node). But that root node was created by the first edge that was made a root. Then, the subsequent edges that we attach to that root node are not root edges: they are attached to the existing root. So the root edge is only the one that created the root node.

Therefore, the count of trees is the number of times we choose to make an edge a root edge.

Now, the algorithm:

- Sort edges by w in increasing order.
- Create a dictionary: `available` that maps an A value to a collection (like a list, or a count) of nodes with that A value that are available (i.e., have out-degree < M). But what do we store? Actually, we don't need the entire node, because the only thing that matters is: for a given A value, how many available nodes there are? But wait: each node has an incoming weight, but we don't need it because we process in increasing order so any existing node is valid. And the constraint is only on the number of children we can attach (the out-degree). So for each node, we track its current out-degree. But for the purpose of the data structure, we only care about: for a given A value, how many nodes with that A value are available? Actually, no: because if we have two nodes with the same A value, and one has out-degree 0 and the other has out-degree 1 (if M=2), then we have two available nodes. But when we attach an edge to one of them, we use one slot. So we need to know the count of available nodes? But actually, if we have multiple available nodes with the same A value, we can attach to any one. But each node has a capacity: we can attach up to M - current_degree. But if we have several nodes, we can choose to attach to any one. However, we don't care which one: we just need to know if there is at least one available node.

But actually, we do: because if we attach to a node, we use one of its slots. Then, if it becomes full (out-degree == M), we remove it from the available set. So we need to know the count of available nodes? Or we can manage per node?

Alternatively, we can maintain for each A value, a counter of how many available slots we have for that A value. Initially, for an A value, the available slots = 0. Then:

- When we create a root node (by making an edge a root edge): we create a node with A=u, and it has capacity M (but we just used one child, so available slots = M - 1). Then, we add M-1 to the available slots for A=u? But wait, we have one node that has out-degree 1 and can take up to M-1 more children. So the available slots for A=u increases by (M-1).

- When we create a child node (from an edge): we create a node with A=v, and it has out-degree 0, so available slots = M. Then we add M to the available slots for A=v.

- When we attach an edge to a node with A=u: we use one slot. So we reduce the available slots for A=u by 1. But then, the node we attached to has its out-degree increased by one. So if it had available slots = s, now it's s-1. But we don't track per node, we track per A value the total available slots.

But is that valid? Because each node contributes independently. The total available slots for A=u is the sum over all nodes with A=u of (M - current_out_degree). Then, when we attach an edge, we use one slot from one of the nodes. So we reduce the total available slots by 1.

Moreover, when we create a new node (either as root or as child), we add the available slots of that node to the total for its A value.

But we don't need to know which node we attach to; we only care that there is at least one available slot for A=u.

So the algorithm:

- Initialize:
  - `slots` = a dictionary (defaultdict or map) that maps an A value to the total available slots for that A value.
  - `trees` = 0

- For each edge (u, v, w) in sorted order by w:
  - If `slots` has a key u and `slots[u]` > 0: 
        Then we use one slot from A=u: 
        slots[u] = slots[u] - 1
        Then, we are creating a new node for v. This new node has M available slots (because it's a new node with out-degree 0). So we add M to slots[v] (if v exists, or initialize if not).
        Note: we don't create a new tree; we attach to an existing node.
  - Else (no available slot for u):
        Then we make this edge a root edge. This creates a new tree: trees++.
        Then, for the root node: we create a node with A=u. It has out-degree 1 (because we are attaching one child). So available slots for u: we add (M - 1) to slots[u].
        Also, we create the child node with A=v: so we add M to slots[v].

But wait: what if we are creating the root node and the slot for u already exists? For example, there might be other nodes with A=u that are available. But in the else branch, we are making a root edge because there was no available slot for u. Then, we create a new node for the root (even if there are other nodes with A=u). So we add M-1 to slots[u]. This is independent of any existing nodes.

But note: when we make a root edge, we create a new node for the root (with A=u). Then, we add its available slots (M-1) to the total for A=u.

Similarly, when we create the child node, we add M to slots[v].

But what if there are multiple nodes with the same A? The dictionary `slots` aggregates the total available slots for that A value.

But is this correct? Let me test with the sample.

Sample 1: 
Input: 
5 2
2 4 3
4 4 5
4 7 1
7 2 4
4 8 2

Sorted by w: 
w=1: (4,7,1)
w=2: (4,8,2)
w=3: (2,4,3)
w=4: (7,2,4)
w=5: (4,4,5)

Initialize: slots = {}, trees=0

Process edge w=1: (4,7,1)
  Check slots for u=4: not present -> 0. So use else: make it a root edge.
    trees = 1
    Add M-1 = 1 to slots[4]: slots[4]=1
    Add M=2 to slots[7]: slots[7]=2

Process edge w=2: (4,8,2)
  Check slots[4]=1 >0 -> use it.
    slots[4] = 1-1 = 0
    Then, add M=2 to slots[8] -> slots[8]=2

Process edge w=3: (2,4,3)
  Check slots for u=2: not present -> 0. So make it a root edge.
    trees = 2
    Add M-1=1 to slots[2]: slots[2]=1
    Add M=2 to slots[4]: slots[4] becomes 0+2=2? But wait, slots[4] was 0, now we add 2 -> 2.

Process edge w=4: (7,2,4)
  Check slots[7]=2>0 -> use it.
    slots[7] = 2-1=1
    Then, add M=2 to slots[2]: slots[2]=1+2=3

Process edge w=5: (4,4,5)
  Check slots[4]=2>0 -> use it.
    slots[4]=2-1=1
    Then, add M=2 to slots[4]: now slots[4]=1+2=3

Total trees = 2. Output 2. Matches sample.

But what about the internal node condition? For the edge w=5: (4,4,5). We attach it to a node with A=4. Which node? There are two nodes with A=4: the root node from the first edge (w=1) and the node created by edge w=3 (which is the child of the root with w=3). 

The node from the first edge: it was created as a root, so incoming weight=0. The edge w=5: weight=5>0, so it's okay.

The node from the third edge: it was created by the edge (2,4,3): so its incoming weight=3. The new edge w=5>3, so it's okay.

And the node we attach to: if we attach to the first node (the root), then that node now has two children: w=1 (the first child) and w=5. The root's out-degree becomes 2 (which is M=2). Then we remove it? Actually, in our algorithm, we reduced the available slots for A=4 by 1. But the root node had one slot left (because we added M-1=1 initially, and we used one for w=2, so it was 0? Wait no: after processing w=2, we set slots[4]=0. Then when processing w=3, we added 2 to slots[4] (because we created a new child node with A=4? Actually, no: the edge w=3 is (2,4,3): we made it a root edge. So we created a root node with A=2 and a child node with A=4. For the child node, we added M=2 to slots[4]. So slots[4] becomes 0 (from previous) + 2 = 2.

So when we attach w=5 to A=4, we use one slot: so one of the two available nodes (with A=4) is used. It could be either the root node (which had one slot left? Actually, the root node from the first edge: after we used it for w=2, we reduced its slot? How do we track per node? We don't. We only have the total available slots per A value. So we don't care which node we use: the condition is automatically satisfied because we process in increasing weight.

Now, sample 2: 
Input: 
5 1
2 4 3
4 4 5
4 7 1
7 2 4
4 8 2

Sorted by w: same as above.

Process w=1: (4,7,1) -> root. trees=1. slots[4] += (1-1)=0 -> slots[4]=0? M=1, so M-1=0. Then slots[7] +=1 -> slots[7]=1.

Process w=2: (4,8,2) -> check slots[4]=0 -> no. So make root. trees=2. Then, slots[4] += (1-1)=0 -> remains 0? Then slots[8] +=1.

Process w=3: (2,4,3) -> check slots[2] (none) -> root. trees=3. slots[2] +=0, slots[4] +=1 -> now slots[4]=1.

Process w=4: (7,2,4) -> check slots[7]=1>0 -> use it. Then slots[7]=0. Then add slots[2] +=1 -> slots[2]=1.

Process w=5: (4,4,5) -> check slots[4]=1>0 -> use it. Then slots[4]=0. Then add slots[4] +=1 -> slots[4]=1.

Trees=3. Output 3. Matches sample.

Sample 3: 
5 10
1000 3000 3
2000 4000 5
1000 2000 1
3000 2000 4
2000 3000 2

Sort by w:
w=1: (1000,2000,1)
w=2: (2000,3000,2)
w=3: (1000,3000,3)   -> wait, the input has (1000,3000,3) and (1000,2000,1) and (2000,3000,2) and (3000,2000,4) and (2000,4000,5). 

Actually, the third sample input:
5 10
1000 3000 3
2000 4000 5
1000 2000 1
3000 2000 4
2000 3000 2

Sorted by w:
1: (1000,2000,1)
2: (2000,3000,2)
3: (1000,3000,3)
4: (3000,2000,4)  -> note: u=3000, v=2000
5: (2000,4000,5)

Now:

Initialize: trees=0, slots={}

w=1: (1000,2000,1) -> root? Check slots[1000]: none -> root. trees=1.
  slots[1000] += (10-1)=9
  slots[2000] +=10 -> 10

w=2: (2000,3000,2) -> slots[2000]=10>0 -> use it. 
  slots[2000] = 10-1=9
  slots[3000] +=10 -> 10

w=3: (1000,3000,3) -> slots[1000]=9>0 -> use it.
  slots[1000]=9-1=8
  slots[3000] +=10 -> 10+10=20

w=4: (3000,2000,4) -> slots[3000]=20>0 -> use it.
  slots[3000]=20-1=19
  slots[2000] +=10 -> 9+10=19

w=5: (2000,4000,5) -> slots[2000]=19>0 -> use it.
  slots[2000]=19-1=18
  slots[4000] +=10 -> 10

Total trees=1. Output 1. Correct.

But let me check the conditions: 

- The edge (1000,2000,1) is the root edge: creates root node (1000) and child (2000) with incoming edge 1.
- Then we attach (2000,3000,2) to the node 2000: now node 2000 has one child. The incoming edge to 2000 is 1, and the outgoing edge 2>1: okay.
- Then we attach (1000,3000,3) to the root node (1000): so the root now has two children: one to 2000 (w=1) and one to 3000 (w=3). The root has no incoming edge, so no problem. The child node 3000 has incoming edge 3.
- Then we attach (3000,2000,4) to node 3000: so node 3000 has a child with A=2000. The edge weight 4>3: okay. Now, we create a new node with A=2000? But there is already a node with A=2000? But we can have multiple. This new node has incoming weight 4.
- Then we attach (2000,4000,5) to which node 2000? There are two nodes with A=2000: one created by the first edge (incoming weight=1) and one created by the fourth edge (incoming weight=4). We can attach to either? But the algorithm only checks the available slots for A=2000, which is 19 (total). When we use one, we don't specify which. But the condition: if we attach to the first node (incoming weight=1), then we require that the new edge weight 5>1: okay. If we attach to the second node (incoming weight=4), then 5>4: also okay. So either is valid.

Therefore, the algorithm works.

But note: the dictionary `slots` might have keys that are not present: so we can use a defaultdict(int) for slots.

Also, we iterate over N edges, and each update is O(1) per edge. The sorting is O(N log N). So the total time is O(N log N), which is acceptable for N up to 100,000.

Memory: we store a dictionary that has at most as many keys as distinct A values. The distinct A values can be up to 2*N? Because we have 2*N node values (each edge gives two). So the dictionary might have up to 200,000 keys? But we only store the total slots per key. So memory is O(N).

Therefore, the solution is:

1. Read N, M.
2. Read the N edges: each (u, v, w).
3. Sort the edges by w.
4. Initialize:
   - trees = 0
   - slots = defaultdict(int)  # or a map, default 0
5. For each edge (u, v, w) in the sorted list:
   - if slots[u] > 0:
        slots[u] -= 1
        # Then, the new node for v: add M to slots[v]
        slots[v] += M   # note: if v not present, it becomes M.
   - else:
        trees += 1   # make this edge a root edge
        # For the root node u: we create a node, which can have M-1 more children.
        slots[u] += (M - 1)   # because we just used one child for this edge
        slots[v] += M
6. Print trees.

But wait: in the else branch, we do:
   trees += 1
   slots[u] += (M-1)
   slots[v] += M

But what if u is already in slots? Then we do slots[u] = current_value + (M-1). Similarly for v.

In the if branch: when we attach, we do:
   slots[u] -= 1   (so we use one slot from the total of u)
   slots[v] += M   (we create a new node for v, which has M slots)

This matches the examples.

But note: the initial state: if we have multiple edges with the same u, we can use the same root node? Actually, no: because when we make an edge a root edge, we create a new root node. But if we have two root edges with the same u, we create two separate root nodes. Then, the available slots for u is the sum of the available slots from both root nodes and any other non-root nodes with A=u.

This is correct.

Let me test with a small example: 
N=1, M=1: 
Input: 
1 1
10 20 1

Process: 
Sorted: only edge (10,20,1)
Check slots[10]: 0 -> make root. trees=1.
Then, slots[10] += (1-1)=0
slots[20] +=1

Output 1.

Another: N=2, M=1
Two edges: 
(10,20,1) and (20,30,2)

Sorted: first (10,20,1), then (20,30,2)

First edge: root. trees=1. Then:
   slots[10]=0 (because M-1=0), slots[20]=1.

Second edge: u=20 -> slots[20]=1>0 -> use it. Then:
   slots[20] = 0
   slots[30] +=1

trees=1.

But if we have:
Two edges: 
(10,20,1) and (10,30,2) with M=1.

First edge: root. trees=1. Then slots[10]=0, slots[20]=1.
Second edge: u=10 -> slots[10]=0 -> must make root. trees=2.
Then, slots[10] += (1-1)=0, slots[30]=1.

So output 2.

But is that valid? We have two root edges: both with u=10. Then we create two root nodes (each with A=10). Each has one child. Then the forest has two trees. And M=1: each node can have at most one child. So it's correct.

Therefore, the solution is:

trees = 0
slots = defaultdict(int)

edges sorted by w

for (u, v, w) in edges:
    if slots[u] > 0:
        slots[u] -= 1
        slots[v] += M
    else:
        trees += 1
        slots[u] += M-1
        slots[v] += M

print(trees)

But wait: in the else branch, we do slots[u] += M-1. But if u was already in the dictionary, we add to it. That's correct: because we are creating a new root node that contributes M-1 available slots.

This should be correct.

Let me test with the provided examples.

First sample: 
edges sorted: 
(4,7,1): else -> trees=1, slots[4]=1 (M-1=2-1=1), slots[7]=2
(4,8,2): if -> slots[4]=1 -> becomes 0, slots[8]=0+2=2
(2,4,3): else -> trees=2, slots[2]=1 (M-1=1), slots[4]=0+2=2
(7,2,4): if -> slots[7]=2>0 -> becomes 1, slots[2]=1+2=3
(4,4,5): if -> slots[4]=2>0 -> becomes 1, slots[4]=1+2=3

Output trees=2.

Second sample: M=1
edges same.

(4,7,1): else -> trees=1, slots[4]=0, slots[7]=1
(4,8,2): if? slots[4]=0 -> else: trees=2, slots[4]=0, slots[8]=1
(2,4,3): else: trees=3, slots[2]=0, slots[4]=1
(7,2,4): if: slots[7]=1>0 -> use: slots[7]=0, slots[2]=0+1=1
(4,4,5): if: slots[4]=1>0 -> use: slots[4]=0, slots[4]=0+1=1

Trees=3.

Third sample: M=10
edges: sorted by w: 
(1000,2000,1): else -> trees=1, slots[1000]=9, slots[2000]=10
(2000,3000,2): if -> slots[2000]=10 ->9, slots[3000]=10
(1000,3000,3): if -> slots[1000]=9->8, slots[3000]=10+10=20
(3000,2000,4): if -> slots[3000]=20->19, slots[2000]=9+10=19
(2000,4000,5): if -> slots[2000]=19->18, slots[4000]=10

Trees=1.

So the code is:

```python
import sys
from collections import defaultdict

def main():
    data = sys.stdin.read().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    m_val = int(data[1])
    edges = []
    index = 2
    for i in range(n):
        u = int(data[index]); v = int(data[index+1]); w = int(data[index+2])
        index += 3
        edges.append((u, v, w))
    
    edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])   # sort by w
    
    trees = 0
    slots = defaultdict(int)
    
    for u, v, w in edges:
        if slots[u] > 0:
            slots[u] -= 1
            slots[v] += m_val
        else:
            trees += 1
            slots[u] += m_val - 1
            slots[v] += m_val
            
    print(trees)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

But note: the problem says the node values u_i, v_i can be up to 2e9, so we use a dictionary (defaultdict) which is efficient.

Time: O(N log N) for sorting and O(N) for the loop.

Memory: O(N) for the dictionary.

Therefore, this solution should work.

But wait: what if M=0? But N>=1, and M>=1? The input: 1<=N,M<=100000. So M>=1.

Also, the weights are distinct and between 1 and N.

So the solution is as above.

But the problem says: the forest should have exactly N edges. Our algorithm uses all N edges: each edge is processed once and assigned to a tree. So the forest has N edges. The number of trees is the number of root edges.

So we output the number of trees.

This solution matches the samples.

Therefore, the editorial can explain:

- The problem requires building a forest from N edges (each with a parent node value, a child node value, and a unique edge weight) that satisfies several conditions: each tree is rooted, the edge weights increase downward (for internal nodes: the parent edge is less than any child edge), and each node has at most M children. The goal is to minimize the number of trees.

- The key insight is that processing edges in increasing order of weight ensures that when we attach an edge to an existing node, the condition that the node's incoming edge weight is less than the new edge's weight is automatically satisfied (because the node was created by an earlier edge with a lower weight).

- We maintain a data structure (a dictionary) that counts the total available "slots" for each node value A. A slot represents the capacity of a node (with a specific A value) to have more children (i.e., the number of additional children we can attach to any node with that A value).

- For each edge (u, v, w):
   - If there is at least one available slot for a node with A=u (i.e., slots[u] > 0), we use one slot (to attach the edge to one of the nodes with A=u). Then, we create a new node for the child (with A=v), which has M available slots (since it can have up to M children). So we add M to slots[v].
   - Otherwise, we make this edge a root edge (starting a new tree). This creates a root node (with A=u) that has M-1 available slots (because we use one child for the current edge). We also create the child node (with A=v) and add M to slots[v].

- The number of trees is the number of times we choose the second option (root edge).

- The algorithm runs in O(N log N) time (due to sorting) and O(N) space.

This approach efficiently builds the forest while satisfying all constraints and minimizing the number of trees.
