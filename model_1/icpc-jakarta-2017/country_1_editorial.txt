### Approach
The problem requires assigning a unique country code of length \( K \) to each country such that:
1. The code is a subsequence of the country's name.
2. The first character of the code matches the first character of the country's name.
3. The lexicographical order of the country names matches the lexicographical order of their codes.

The solution involves the following steps:

1. **Preprocessing for Each Country**: For each country name, preprocess a dictionary that maps each character to the sorted list of indices where it appears. This helps in efficiently finding the positions of characters during subsequence generation.

2. **Sorting Countries**: Sort the countries lexicographically by their names. This allows us to process them in an order where each subsequent country's name is lexicographically greater than or equal to the previous one, ensuring we can assign codes in increasing order.

3. **Generating Codes**:
   - **First Country**: Assign the lexicographically smallest valid code (a subsequence of length \( K \) starting with the country's first character) to the first country in the sorted list. This is done by greedily selecting the smallest possible characters at each step while ensuring enough characters remain to complete the code.
   - **Subsequent Countries**: For each subsequent country, generate the lexicographically smallest code that is greater than or equal to the previous country's code. If the generated code equals the previous code, we then find the next lexicographically greater valid code to maintain strict lexicographical order.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: If at any point a valid code cannot be generated for a country (either no valid subsequence exists or no lexicographically greater code is available), output "NO".

5. **Output**: If all countries are assigned valid codes in the required order, output "YES" followed by the codes in the original input order.

### Explanation
1. **Preprocessing**: For each country name, we create a dictionary (`pos_maps`) that maps each character to the list of its indices in the name. This helps in quickly locating characters during subsequence checks.
2. **Sorting**: Countries are sorted lexicographically to process them in order, ensuring each subsequent country's name is lexicographically greater than or equal to the previous one.
3. **Code Generation**:
   - **First Country**: The lexicographically smallest valid code (subsequence of length \( K \)) is generated by selecting the smallest available characters while ensuring enough characters remain to complete the code.
   - **Subsequent Countries**: For each country, the lexicographically smallest code greater than or equal to the previous country's code is generated. If this code matches the previous code, the next lexicographically greater valid code is found to maintain strict order.
4. **Edge Handling**: If any country cannot be assigned a valid code, "NO" is printed immediately.
5. **Output**: After processing all countries, "YES" is printed if all have valid codes, followed by the codes in the original input order.

This approach efficiently handles the constraints by leveraging preprocessing and greedy selection, ensuring correctness while maintaining optimal performance.
