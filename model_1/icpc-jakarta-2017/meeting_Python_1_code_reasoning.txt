We are given: first line has N, K, T; second line has list A of N integers.

Constraints: 
  1 <= K <= N <= 100,000
  0 <= T <= 1,000,000,000
  0 <= A_i <= T

We can choose a non-integer meeting start time S (positive real). Then, a subordinate is present if their arrival time <= S.

We can adjust arrival times by paying $1 per second per subordinate. Constraints:
  - subordinate must not arrive strictly before 0 (>=0) and not strictly later than T (<=T).

We need exactly K subordinates present.

Special cases:
  - If T == 0: then all subordinates must be at time 0. Therefore, if K == n, then we can have them all (cost 0). Otherwise, we cannot have exactly K (because we cannot push any to be later than T=0 and we cannot have less than n? Actually: if K < n, then we would have to push some to be later than 0, but T=0 forbids that -> impossible -> output -1).
  - If K == n: then we need all subordinates present. We can set S to be at least max(A_i). Since we can choose S non-integer, we can set S = max(A_i) + 0.5? But note: we can also adjust the arrival times arbitrarily (as long as they are in [0, T]). Actually, we don't need to adjust at all? But wait: if we don't adjust, then we can set S to max(A_i)+0.5 and all are present. So cost 0? However, what if max(A_i) is T? Then we cannot set any to be later? But we don't need to push any to be later? Actually, we don't need to adjust any. So cost 0.

But note: what if we have two subordinates at T, and K=1? Then we cannot have exactly one? Actually, we are in the case K=n? So if K==n, we require all. So we set S >= max(A_i). We don't need to adjust. So cost 0.

However, there is a catch: what if we have multiple subordinates at T? Then we cannot push any to be later (because T is the maximum). But we don't need to push them later? We only need them to be present. So if they are at T, then set S = T + 0.5? But note: T is the maximum, so we cannot have them arriving at T+0.5. Therefore, we must set S <= T. Actually, the meeting starts at S (a positive real) and the subordinate arrives at T (which is an integer). Then if we set S = T + 0.5, then the subordinate arriving at T is at time T, which is strictly less than T+0.5? Actually, no: the meeting starts at time S = T+0.5, and the subordinate arrives at T, which is before T+0.5 -> so they are present.

But note the constraint: a subordinate must not arrive strictly later than T. So they can arrive at T. Therefore, setting S = T+0.5 is allowed? The problem says: "a subordinate must not arrive strictly later than T seconds after you". So T is allowed.

Therefore, if we set S = T + 0.5, then all subordinates that are at T are present. So the only problem is when we need to push someone beyond T? But we don't do that.

So for K==n: we can set S = max(A) + 0.5 (if max(A) < T) or even T+0.5 if max(A)=T. Therefore, no adjustment is needed. So cost 0.

But wait: what if we have a subordinate at T, and we set S = T+0.5? That's acceptable because the subordinate arrives at T and T <= T+0.5? Yes.

So the special cases: 
  if T==0: 
      if K==n: cost=0
      else: impossible -> -1
  if K==n: cost=0

But note: what if we have a subordinate with arrival time 0? Then we cannot push them earlier? Actually, we can push them later? But we don't need to: because we require all to be present. So we set S to max(A) + 0.5 -> all are present.

Now, the general case: 0 < K < n.

The key idea: we can choose a non-integer S. Therefore, we can choose an integer m such that S is in (m, m+1). Then:
  - All subordinates with arrival time <= m will be present (because m < S, so they are already there).
  - All subordinates with arrival time >= m+1 will not be present (because S < m+1? Actually, no: S is in (m, m+1), so arrival time >= m+1 means they arrive at m+1 or later, which is after S? Because S < m+1? So they are not present.

Therefore, to have exactly K people, we require:
  - Exactly K subordinates must have arrival time <= m.
  - The other n-K must have arrival time >= m+1.

But note: we can adjust the arrival times arbitrarily (within [0, T]) at a cost of the absolute change.

So the problem reduces to: 
  Find an integer m in [0, T-1] (because if m = T, then we cannot have the next being T+1? Actually, m must be at most T-1 so that we can set the others to at least m+1 which is <= T) such that we can adjust the array so that:
      exactly K numbers are <= m, 
      and the rest are >= m+1.

How to compute the cost for a fixed m?

We split the subordinates into two groups:
  Group 1: the K subordinates that we want to be <= m.
  Group 2: the n-K subordinates that we want to be >= m+1.

The cost is the sum of adjustments for each subordinate.

For a subordinate originally at a:
  - If we assign it to Group 1: we must have a' <= m. 
      If a <= m: we can leave it as is (cost 0) or even reduce it? But why reduce? Actually, we can also set it to any value in [0, m]. The minimal cost is to set it to min(a, m) but wait: we might push it to m? Actually, we don't need to push it above? We can only push it to a value between 0 and m. The minimal adjustment is 0 if a <= m. However, if a > m, then we must push it down to at most m, which costs (a - m). But note: we can also leave it above? Then we would have to push it down? Actually, if we assign an a>m to Group1, we must push it down to at most m: cost a - m.

  - If we assign it to Group 2: we must have a' >= m+1.
      If a >= m+1: cost 0.
      If a < m+1: we must push it up to at least m+1: cost (m+1 - a).

But we are free to assign which ones are in Group1 and which in Group2? And we want the minimal total cost for fixed m.

However, note: we cannot assign arbitrarily? We have to choose which K will be in Group1 and which n-K in Group2? And we want the minimal total cost.

How to choose the assignment? 
  We would prefer to put a subordinate in Group1 if the cost for Group1 is low and in Group2 if the cost for Group2 is low.

But note: for a fixed subordinate, the cost if we put it in Group1 is:
   cost1(a) = max(0, a - m)   [if a>m we push down to m; if a<=m, we leave it? Actually, we can leave it? But we might also push it even lower? Why would we? We only require <=m. So minimal cost is 0 for a<=m and a-m for a>m? However, we might also push it down arbitrarily? But we don't have to: we can leave it at a if a<=m. So cost1(a) = 0 if a<=m, else a-m.

Similarly, cost2(a) = max(0, m+1 - a)   [if a < m+1, then we have to push it up to m+1; else 0].

But note: we cannot assign arbitrarily? Actually, we have to choose exactly K for Group1. 

We want to minimize:
   total_cost = sum_{i in Group1} cost1(a_i) + sum_{i in Group2} cost2(a_i)

This is separable: for each subordinate, we can consider the difference in cost if we put it in Group1 vs Group2.

Alternatively, note that if we assign a subordinate to Group1, we avoid paying cost2(a_i) and pay cost1(a_i) instead. The base cost if we assign everyone to Group2 would be sum_i cost2(a_i). Then, if we move a subordinate i from Group2 to Group1, the change in cost is: 
   cost1(a_i) - cost2(a_i)

So total_cost = [sum_i cost2(a_i)] + sum_{i in Group1} [ cost1(a_i) - cost2(a_i) ]

Therefore, to minimize total_cost, we want to choose K subordinates for Group1 that minimize (cost1(a_i) - cost2(a_i)).

But note: we can compute for each subordinate the value:
   diff(a) = cost1(a) - cost2(a)

What is diff(a)?
   If a <= m:
        cost1(a)=0, cost2(a)=m+1 - a -> diff(a) = 0 - (m+1 - a) = a - (m+1)
   If a > m:
        cost1(a)=a-m, cost2(a)=0 -> diff(a)=a-m

But note: we can also consider the entire range? Actually, we can also break at m and m+1? However, the expression is:

   diff(a) = 
        a - (m+1)   for a <= m
        a - m        for a > m

But wait: for a<=m: diff(a) = a - (m+1) = negative? 
        for a>m: diff(a) = a - m = positive.

Therefore, we would prefer to put the ones with the smallest diff(a) (which are the ones with smallest a) into Group1? Actually, for a<=m: the expression is a-(m+1) which is negative, so we save money by putting them in Group1? For a>m: the expression is a-m which is positive, so we lose money by putting them in Group1? 

Therefore, we want to put as many as possible of the ones with a<=m into Group1? Because they give negative diff? And then we have to fill the rest with the ones with a>m that have the smallest a? (because a-m is increasing with a).

So the optimal assignment for fixed m is:
   - We take all the subordinates with a <= m? But we only need K. Since for a<=m, the diff is negative (so we save by putting them in Group1) we want to take them first. Then, if we need more, we take the smallest a from the a>m group (because they have the smallest a-m).

Therefore, we can do:
   Sort the array A.

   Let:
     r = number of a_i <= m.

   Then, we can take up to r subordinates from the a_i<=m group. The cost savings for these is: 
        for each a_i<=m: diff(a_i) = a_i - (m+1)

   Then, if we take s = max(0, K - r) from the a_i>m group, we take the s smallest a_i in the a_i>m group (which are the first s in the sorted array for the a_i>m segment). For these, diff(a_i)=a_i - m.

   Therefore, the total cost for fixed m is:
        base = sum_{i} cost2(a_i)   [which is: for each a_i, max(0, m+1 - a_i)]
        plus the sum of the K smallest diff(a_i) values? Actually, we are taking the r subordinates in the left (which are the entire set of a_i<=m) and then s subordinates from the right (the smallest ones). 

But note: the expression above: 
        total_cost = base + sum_{i in Group1} diff(a_i)

But base = sum_{i} max(0, m+1 - a_i) = for a_i <= m: (m+1 - a_i) and for a_i>m: 0.

So base = sum_{a_i<=m} (m+1 - a_i)

Then, the adjustment for Group1: 
        for a_i<=m: we have diff(a_i)=a_i - (m+1) -> so the term for each such a_i is (a_i - (m+1)) which cancels the base term? Actually, no: 
        total_cost = base + [sum_{i in Group1} diff(a_i)]

        For a_i<=m that we put in Group1: 
            term = base_part for a_i (which is m+1 - a_i) + diff(a_i) = (m+1 - a_i) + (a_i - (m+1)) = 0.

        But wait: base is the entire sum over all i? Then we subtract the ones that are not in Group2? Actually, no: our base was the cost if everyone is in Group2. Then we move K people to Group1 and for each one we subtract the cost2 (because they are no longer in Group2) and add the cost1. 

Alternatively, we can compute the cost directly:

   total_cost = 
        for the r' = min(r, K) subordinates that are in the left and we put in Group1: we pay 0? Actually, we don't need to adjust the ones that are already <=m? But if we leave them, that's fine. However, we might have to adjust the ones that are in the left that we leave in Group2? No: we are taking exactly K. The ones we leave in the left? Actually, we must put the ones we don't choose in Group2. For a_i<=m that we put in Group2: we have to push them to at least m+1? So we pay (m+1 - a_i). 

But we are free to choose which ones to put in Group1? So we want to avoid paying for as many of the a_i<=m as possible? We put as many as we can (min(r, K)) in Group1? Then the rest of the a_i<=m (if any) we put in Group2 and pay (m+1 - a_i) for each.

For the a_i>m: 
   We need to have exactly K in Group1. If we have taken r (if r<=K) from the left, then we need K - r from the right. For each of these, we have to push them down to m? So we pay (a_i - m). 
   The ones we leave in the right: we don't need to adjust? Because they are already > m? But we require them to be >=m+1? They are already >m, so if they are at least m+1, we leave them. If they are between m and m+1? Actually, they are >m, so they are at least m+1? Because they are integers? No: the problem says the original A_i are integers? And we adjust by integer seconds? So the adjusted times are integers? Therefore, if we have an a_i that is m+0.5? No, we can only adjust by integer amounts so the adjusted time must be an integer. Therefore, if we have a_i>m, then a_i is at least m+1? Because integers? Actually, if a_i is originally an integer and we adjust by integers, then the adjusted time is an integer. Therefore, if we put a subordinate in Group2, we require an integer >=m+1. 

But note: we can adjust the arrival time arbitrarily by integer amounts? So we can set it to any integer in [0,T]. Therefore, if we have an a_i that is m+0.5? No, because the original and adjusted times are integers.

Therefore, the array A is integers, and we adjust to integers. So the condition for Group2 is: adjusted time >= m+1 (which is an integer).

So for a_i>m: they are integers, so they are at least m+1? Actually, if a_i>m and integer, then a_i>=m+1. Therefore, we don't need to adjust them? So cost for leaving them in Group2 is 0? 

But wait: what if a_i is exactly m+1? Then it's already in Group2? But if we put it in Group1, we have to push it down to m? So cost a_i - m = 1.

Therefore, for fixed m, the cost is:

   Let r = number of a_i <= m.

   Then, we will put min(r, K) subordinates from the left (the ones with a_i<=m) into Group1. The rest of the left (if any) must be pushed to m+1: that's (m+1 - a_i) for each such a_i.

   And we will put max(0, K - r) subordinates from the right (the ones with a_i>m) into Group1. For each of these, we pay (a_i - m).

   Therefore, total_cost = 
        [for the left that are not chosen: we have (r - min(r,K)) = max(0, r-K) subordinates that we push to m+1: but note we can push them individually? Actually, we only need to push each one to m+1? So the cost for one such subordinate is (m+1 - a_i). So we need the sum of (m+1 - a_i) for the left subordinates that we leave in Group2? But note: we are forced to leave (r - min(r,K)) = r - min(r,K) = if r>=K, then we leave r-K subordinates? But we choose which ones to leave? We want to leave the ones that are the highest (closest to m) to minimize the cost? Actually, the cost for a_i<=m to be pushed to m+1 is (m+1 - a_i). So we want to leave the ones that have the largest a_i? Because then (m+1 - a_i) is smallest.

   Alternatively, we can think: we want to choose the K subordinates in Group1 to be the ones that are as large as possible in the left and as small as possible in the right? Actually:

        For the left: we want to put the ones that are closest to m (the largest a_i in the left) into Group1? Why? Because then the ones we leave are the smallest a_i? And the cost (m+1 - a_i) is larger for smaller a_i? So we want to avoid leaving a_i that are very small? Therefore, we should put the largest ones in the left into Group1? 

        Similarly, for the right: we want to put the smallest ones (closest to m+1) into Group1? Because then the cost (a_i - m) is minimized.

   Therefore, the optimal assignment for fixed m is:

        Sort the array.

        We want to take the largest K subordinates from the entire array? But no: we have to split by m.

        Actually, we take:
          - The largest min(r, K) from the left (so that the ones we leave in the left are the smallest, which we don't want? Actually, no: we want to minimize the cost for the left that we leave? That is: we want to leave the largest ones? But we are forced to leave r-K if r>K? Then we leave the smallest ones? That would be bad. 

        Alternatively, we can express the cost as:

          total_cost = 
            [if r >= K: 
                We leave (r - K) subordinates from the left in Group2. We choose which ones to leave? We choose the ones that are the smallest (so that we leave the ones that require the most cost) is not what we want. We want to leave the ones that require the least cost? Actually, no: we want to minimize the cost? Then we want to leave the ones that have the smallest cost? That is the largest a_i in the left? 

          Therefore, we want to leave the largest a_i in the left? Then the cost for leaving a_i is (m+1 - a_i) is minimized when a_i is large.

        So for the left: we want to push the smallest ones to m+1? That is, we keep the largest K in the left? 

        Similarly, for the right: we take the smallest (K - r) to push down? 

        Therefore, the cost for fixed m:

          Let r = number of a_i <= m.

          We are going to keep the largest K elements in the left? Actually, we are going to keep the largest min(r, K) in the left? Then the left that we leave (if r>K) are the smallest (r-K) ones? 

          Then the cost from the left: 
               = sum_{i in the smallest (r-K) in the left} (m+1 - a_i)

          For the right: we take the smallest (K - r) ones (if K>r) and push them to m? 
               = sum_{i in the smallest (K-r) in the right} (a_i - m)

        Therefore, total_cost = 
            if r >= K: 
                = (m+1) * (r-K) - [sum of the smallest (r-K) in the left] 
            else: 
                = [sum of the smallest (K-r) in the right] - m * (K-r)

        But note: the prefix sum of the entire array? 

        How to compute the sum of the smallest (r-K) in the left? 
            The left segment: all a_i<=m, and we want the smallest (r-K) of them? 
            That is the first (r-K) in the sorted array? 

        Similarly, the smallest (K-r) in the right: the first (K-r) of the right segment? But the right segment is sorted? Actually, the entire array is sorted. The right segment starts at index r? 

        So:
            Let sorted array = A[0] <= A[1] <= ... <= A[n-1]

            r = bisect_right(A, m)   -> index r: the first index where A[i] > m.

            Then the left segment: A[0] to A[r-1]. The smallest (r-K) in the left segment: A[0] ... A[r-K-1]? 

            Similarly, the right segment: A[r] to A[n-1]. The smallest (K-r) in the right segment: A[r] ... A[r+(K-r)-1].

        Therefore, we need prefix sums.

        Steps:

          Precompute prefix sums P for the sorted array A: 
            P[0] = 0
            P[i] = A[0] + ... + A[i-1]

          Then:
            if r >= K:
                cost = (m+1) * (r - K) - (P[r-K] - P[0])   # because the smallest (r-K) are the first r-K elements: indices 0 to r-K-1 -> sum = P[r-K] (since P[r-K] = A[0]+...+A[r-K-1])
            else: 
                cost = (P[r + (K-r)] - P[r]) - m * (K-r)   # the next (K-r) elements: from index r to r+(K-r)-1 -> sum = P[r+(K-r)] - P[r]

        However, note: in the r>=K case, the smallest (r-K) are the first (r-K) elements? Actually, the entire left segment is sorted. The smallest (r-K) in the left segment are the first (r-K) elements of the entire array? Because the entire array is sorted.

        Therefore, the above holds.

But note: what if m is not in the range [0, T-1]? Then we skip? Actually, we defined our candidate set from [0, T-1]. 

But note: if m = T, then we cannot have the others at m+1 (which is T+1) because that exceeds T. Therefore, we require m in [0, T-1].

Now, the algorithm:

  Steps:
    if T==0:
        if K==n: 0
        else: -1

    if K==n: 0

    Sort A.

    Precompute prefix sums P: 
        P[0]=0
        for i in range(1, n+1): P[i] = P[i-1] + A[i-1]

    Generate candidate m: 
        candidates = set()
        candidates.add(0)
        if T-1>=0: candidates.add(T-1)
        for a in A:
            if a>=0 and a<=T-1: 
                candidates.add(a)
            if (a-1)>=0 and (a-1)<=T-1:
                candidates.add(a-1)

    Then, for each candidate m in candidates:
        r = bisect_right(A, m)   # gives the count of elements <= m? Actually, the index of the first element > m, so count = r.

        if r >= K:
            # We leave the smallest (r-K) in the left segment (which is the entire left segment? no: we leave the smallest ones) to be pushed to m+1.
            # The cost for that: (m+1) * (r-K) - (sum of the smallest (r-K) in the left segment)
            # The smallest (r-K) in the left segment are the first (r-K) elements? 
            # But note: the left segment is the first r elements? And they are sorted? So the smallest (r-K) are the first (r-K) of the entire array? 
            cost_val = (m+1) * (r-K) - P[r-K]   # because P[r-K] = sum of the first r-K elements? 
        else:
            # We need to take s = K - r from the right segment.
            if r + (K - r) > n: 
                # This candidate m is not valid? Because there aren't enough elements in the right? 
                continue
            cost_val = (P[r+(K-r)] - P[r]) - m * (K - r)

        Then update best = min(best, cost_val)

    Then output best.

But note: what if we have multiple candidates? We take the minimal cost.

However, what if no candidate m is valid? Then we output -1? But note: we have generated m in [0, T-1]. How do we know if it's impossible?

We can initialize best = a big number (like 10**18). If we found a candidate, we update. Then at the end, if best is still 10**18, then output -1.

But wait: is it always impossible? There might be other reasons for impossibility? 

Actually, we also have the constraint that we cannot set a subordinate below 0 or above T. But our cost computations assume we can push the subordinates arbitrarily as long as the result is in [0, T]. However, the problem does not allow pushing below 0 or above T. 

But note: in the cost computations:
   For the left segment that we leave: we push to m+1. Since m<=T-1, then m+1<=T -> so that's allowed.
   For the right segment that we take: we push down to m? But m>=0? So that's allowed? 

However, what if we have to push a subordinate originally at 0 to m+1? That's m+1 which is at least 1? Then that's allowed? 

But what if T=0? We handled that above.

Therefore, the only constraint is that m must be in [0, T-1] and we generate such candidates.

But note: what if T=0? Then we skip the general case.

Also, what if T=1? Then m can only be 0? So we generate m=0? 

But what if we have a sample: 
   "2 1 0" -> T=0 -> then we output -1? 
   "2 1 1" -> sample input: 
        n=2, K=1, T=1, A = [0,0]

        T>0 and K (1) < n (2). 
        Sort A: [0,0]
        Generate candidates: 
            add 0
            T-1 = 0 -> so candidates = {0}
            for a=0: add 0 and also a-1=-1 -> skip (because -1<0) -> so candidate set {0}

        Then for m=0:
            r = bisect_right(A,0) = 2 (because both 0<=0) -> so r=2, which is >=K=1.
            cost_val = (0+1)*(2-1) - P[1] = 1 * 1 - P[1] 
            P[1] = A[0] = 0? Actually, our P: 
                P[0]=0
                P[1]=A[0]=0
                P[2]=A[0]+A[1]=0
            Then we want the smallest (r-K)=1 element? 
            So we take the first 1 element: which is A[0]=0 -> sum = P[1] = 0? 
            cost_val = 1 - 0 = 1.

        Then output 1? Which matches the sample.

But note: what if we have a candidate that requires pushing a subordinate beyond T? 

Actually, we are only pushing:
   - In the left segment: pushing to m+1 (which is <=T, since m<=T-1) -> so that's allowed.
   - In the right segment: pushing down to m (which is >=0) -> allowed.

Therefore, the cost we compute is valid.

But what if we cannot get exactly K? Actually, we are computing the cost for a candidate m. The candidate m must be in [0, T-1]. 

But note: what if we have a candidate that requires taking K-r elements from the right, but there are not enough elements? We skip that candidate? Then if we skip all candidates, we output -1? 

For example: 
   n=2, K=1, T=1, A=[1,1]
        Then we generate candidate m: 
          0 and T-1=0 -> candidate set {0}
        For m=0:
            r = number of a_i<=0 -> 0? 
            Then we need to take 1 from the right? 
            But the right segment has 2 elements? So we can take the smallest 1? 
            cost_val = (P[0+1] - P[0]) - 0*1 = (A[0]?) -> P[1]=1, P[0]=0 -> 1 - 0 = 1.
        So output 1? 

But what if we have:
   n=2, K=1, T=0 -> already handled: output -1.

   n=2, K=1, T=1: we have two samples: [0,0] -> cost 1, [1,1] -> cost 1.

But the sample input "2 1 0" is [0,0] and T=0 -> output -1.

Another sample: 
   "4 2 4
    1 2 3 4" -> output 0.

        Why? 
          We can choose m=2? 
          Then r = count of A_i<=2: [1,2] -> r=2.
          Then cost = (2+1)*(2-2) - P[0] = 0? 
          So candidate m=2: cost 0.

        How do we get m=2? 
          Candidates: 
            add 0
            add 3 (because T-1=3)
            for a in [1,2,3,4]:
               a: 1 -> candidates add 1 and 0
               a: 2 -> candidates add 2 and 1
               a: 3 -> candidates add 3 and 2
               a: 4 -> skip because 4>3? and 3 is the max candidate? 
            So candidates: {0,1,2,3}

          For m=2: as above, cost=0.

Another sample: 
   "4 2 4
    1 2 2 4" -> output 1.

        Sort: [1,2,2,4]
        Candidates: 
          0, 3 (T-1)
          a=1: add 1,0 -> {0,1,3}
          a=2: add 2,1 -> {0,1,2,3}
          a=2: same as above -> no change
          a=4: skip (because 4 and 3 are already in? but 4-1=3 -> already there)

        Now, which m gives the minimal cost?
          Let's try m=1: 
             r = count(A_i<=1) = 1 (only the 1) -> so we need 1 from the right? 
             The smallest 1 in the right: the next element? which is 2 -> cost = (sum of the smallest 1 in the right) - 1*1 = 2 - 1 = 1.

          m=2: 
             r = count(A_i<=2) = 3 -> so we leave 3-2=1 in the left? 
             The smallest 1 in the left: the first element is 1 -> cost = (2+1)*1 - (sum of the smallest 1 in the left) = 3 - 1 = 2.

          m=0: 
             r = count(A_i<=0) = 0 -> then we need 2 from the right? 
             The smallest 2 in the right: A[0] and A[1]? But the array is [1,2,2,4] -> sorted: [1,2,2,4] -> the right segment (a_i>0) is the entire array? 
             Then we take the smallest 2: 1 and 2? -> but wait: we are taking from the right? But the right segment is the entire array? 
             So we take the first two? 1 and 2? 
             cost = (P[2] - P[0]) - 0*2 = (1+2) - 0 = 3.

          m=3: 
             r = count(A_i<=3) = 3 -> cost = (3+1)*(3-2) - P[1]? 
                 Wait: we leave (r-K)=1 in the left? The smallest one in the left? 
                 The entire left segment: A_i<=3: [1,2,2,4]? Actually 4 is not. So [1,2,2] -> r=3.
                 We leave the smallest 1? which is 1? 
                 cost = 4*1 - 1 = 3.

          So the minimal cost is 1 (for m=1).

        Therefore, output 1.

But note: the sample output is 1.

However, the problem says: "you can adjust the arrival time of the third subordinate to become one second later". 

In our array: [1,2,2,4] -> the third subordinate is the second 2? They adjust it to 3? Then we have [1,2,3,4]. Then we can set S=2.5? Then the meeting has the first two? But then we have two? And we need exactly two? 

But note: we are excluding the boss. So we have two subordinates: the first and the second? 

But wait: the adjusted array: [1,2,3,4]. Then at time 2.5, the subordinates present are the one at 1 and the one at 2? The one at 3 and 4 are not? So that's two. 

The cost: we moved one subordinate from 2 to 3: cost 1.

But why did our candidate m=1 give cost 1? 

For m=1: we have to have exactly K=2? 
  We require: 2 subordinates <=1? and the rest >=2? 

But we have one subordinate at 1 (which is <=1) and we push one of the 2's down to 1? Then we have two at 1? Then we set S in (1,2). Then the meeting has these two? 

Alternatively, we can leave the 1 as is, and push one of the 2's to become 1? Then we have two at 1? 

But why did we compute for m=1: 
   We put one from the right (which was 2) into Group1? We pay 2-1 = 1. 

That matches.

But note: we can also push the 1 to become 2? Then we have two 2's? Then set S in (2,3). Then we have the two 2's? 
   How much? 
      Push the 1 to 2: cost 1.
      Then for m=2: we would then have three 2's? Then we leave one? The smallest one? which was originally 1? Now it's 2? Then we leave it? But we don't need to push it? Actually, we require the ones in Group2 to be at least 3? So we have to push that 2 to 3? 
      Then total cost: 1 (for the 1->2) + (3-2) for pushing one of the 2's to 3? -> 2? 

So that's more expensive.

Therefore, the minimal cost is 1.

But note: our candidate m=1 gave cost 1.

Therefore, the algorithm is:

  Steps:
    if T==0:
        if K==n: print(0)
        else: print(-1)
        return

    if K==n: 
        print(0)
        return

    Sort A.

    Precompute prefix sums P: 
        P[0]=0
        for i in range(1, n+1): P[i] = P[i-1] + A[i-1]

    candidates = set()
    candidates.add(0)
    if T-1>=0:
        candidates.add(T-1)
    for a in A:
        if a>=0 and a<=T-1:
            candidates.add(a)
        if a-1>=0 and a-1<=T-1:
            candidates.add(a-1)

    best = 10**18
    for m in candidates:
        # Count r: number of elements <= m
        # bisect_right returns the insertion position? 
        # Actually: bisect_right(A, m) returns the index at which m would be inserted to maintain sorted order? But it returns the first index where A[i] > m? So the count r = index = bisect_right(A, m) -> that is the number of elements <= m.
        r = bisect.bisect_right(A, m)   # returns the index, which is the count.

        if r >= K:
            # We leave (r-K) subordinates in the left segment that we don't put in Group1? and they are the smallest (r-K) ones? 
            # The sum of the smallest (r-K) ones: P[r-K] (because P[i] = sum of first i elements: indices 0 to i-1)
            cost_val = (m+1) * (r - K) - P[r - K]   # because P[r-K] is the sum of the first (r-K) elements (which are the smallest (r-K) in the entire array? and they are all <=m? because the array is sorted and the first r elements are <=m? actually the first r-K are definitely <=m? 
        else:
            s = K - r
            if r + s > n:
                # There are not enough subordinates? 
                continue
            # The smallest s in the right segment: starting at index r, take s elements? 
            # Their sum = P[r+s] - P[r]
            cost_val = (P[r+s] - P[r]) - m * s

        if cost_val < best:
            best = cost_val

    if best == 10**18:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(best)

But note: in the case r>=K, we assume that we can leave the smallest (r-K) ones? But what if we have to push them to m+1? We computed the cost as (m+1)*(r-K) - (sum of the ones we leave). 

But what if the smallest (r-K) ones are already above m+1? They can't be: because they are <=m? So they are at most m? Then we have to push them to m+1? The cost for one is (m+1 - a_i). So total cost = sum_{i in the set} (m+1 - a_i) = (m+1)*(r-K) - (sum of a_i in the set). 

That is correct.

But note: what if we have duplicates? Our sorted array and prefix sums handle duplicates.

One more sample: 
   "2 1 1
    0 0" -> we computed 1? 

   How? 
        n=2, K=1, T=1, A=[0,0] -> sorted [0,0]
        candidates: {0} (because T-1=0, and a=0: add 0 and -1 (skip) -> so only 0)

        m=0: r = bisect_right([0,0],0) = 2? 
        Then r>=K (2>=1): 
            cost_val = (0+1)*(2-1) - P[1] 
            P[1] = sum of first 1 element = 0? 
            cost_val = 1*1 - 0 = 1.

        Output 1.

But the problem says: "you can adjust the arrival time of the second subordinate to become one second later and start the meeting 0.71863781 seconds after you arrived". 

   Cost: 1 dollar.

Therefore, the code.

However, note: we might have m that is not in the candidate set? But we generated a candidate set that includes all a_i, a_i-1 (if in [0,T-1]), 0, and T-1. Why is that sufficient?

   The cost function is piecewise linear? And the critical points are the original a_i and the boundaries? So the minimal cost must occur at one of these points? 

   Alternatively, we can note that the cost function for fixed m is:

        f(m) = 
          if r>=K: (m+1)*(r-K) - (sum of the smallest (r-K) in the left)
          else: (sum of the smallest (K-r) in the right) - m*(K-r)

   And this function is linear in m? Actually, it is linear in m? 

   Then the minimal cost over m in the integers [0, T-1] must occur at an endpoint? But we have more points: we have the a_i and a_i-1? 

   Actually, the function f(m) is defined over integer m? But note: the value of r (the count) changes at the points where m equals an a_i? And also the set of the smallest (r-K) in the left changes? So the minimal cost might occur at m = a_i or m = a_i-1? 

   Therefore, we generated these candidates.

But note: the candidate set size is O(n). So we can iterate over it.

Let's test with the sample: [1,2,2,4] for m=0,1,2,3? We did.

Therefore, we output the code.

But note: we must be cautious with the prefix sums: the prefix sum array P has length n+1: 
   P[0]=0
   P[1]=A[0]
   P[2]=A[0]+A[1]
   ...

   Then for r>=K: we use P[r-K] -> which is the sum of the first (r-K) elements? 

   For the else branch: we use P[r+s] - P[r] -> which is the sum of A[r] to A[r+s-1]? 

   This matches.

Edge: when r-K=0? 
   Then we use P[0] -> which is 0? Then cost=0? That's correct.

   Similarly, when s=0? Then we don't go into the else branch? 

But note: we have an if r>=K.

Therefore, we code accordingly.

Let me test a small case: n=1, K=1, T=10, A=[5]
   Then: 
        T>0, K==n? -> no, because K=1 and n=1? Then K==n? -> yes. So output 0.

But wait: we have K==n? Then we output 0? 

But the problem says: if K==n, output 0.

So we don't go into the general candidate loop.

Another: n=1, K=1, T=10, A=[0]? 
   Then K==n -> 0.

But what if n=1, K=1, T=0? 
   Then T==0: 
        if K==n: yes -> output 0.

But wait: T=0, and the subordinate must be at time 0? Then we can set S=0.5? and the subordinate is present? So cost 0? 

Therefore, we output 0.

But the constraint: the subordinate must not arrive strictly before 0? It arrives at 0 -> which is not strictly before? And not strictly later than T=0? So it's allowed.

Therefore, we output 0.

But the sample input: 
   "2 1 0
    0 0" -> T=0, and K=1, n=2 -> then we output -1.

   Because T==0 and K != n -> output -1.

Now, one more: 
   n=1, K=1, T=5, A=[10] -> but wait, A_i must be between 0 and T? So the input says 0<=A_i<=T. So we don't get A_i=10 when T=5? 

Therefore, we assume A_i in [0,T].

So we code accordingly.

Let's run the provided sample cases.

Sample 1: 
   "4 2 4
    1 2 3 4" -> output 0.

Sample 2: 
   "4 2 4
    1 2 2 4" -> output 1.

Sample 3: 
   "2 1 1
    0 0" -> output 1.

Sample 4: 
   "2 1 0
    0 0" -> output -1.

Therefore, we write the code as below.

Note: we must use bisect_right for the count of elements <= m? Actually, bisect_right(A, m) returns the insertion position for m to keep sorted, such that all values to the left are <= m? But in Python, bisect.bisect_right(A, m) returns the insertion position which is the index after the last occurrence of m? So the count = bisect.bisect_right(A, m) is the number of elements <= m? 

But note: the array A is sorted. Then:
   bisect_left(A, x) returns the first index at which to insert x to maintain sorted order, such that all before are < x? 
   bisect_right(A, x) returns the index after the last x? 

   Therefore, the count of elements <= m is bisect_right(A, m) -> that is correct.

We'll use the bisect module.

Code:

  import bisect

  ... 

  r = bisect.bisect_right(A, m)

But note: if m is very large? Then r = n? 

  Then in the if branch: if r>=K -> true? Then we compute.

But if m is beyond the maximum element? Then r = n? 

  Then we leave (n-K) in the left? The entire array? And we take the smallest (n-K)? 

  But note: we are leaving the smallest (n-K) in the entire array? And pushing them to m+1? 

  But m+1 might be > T? Then we are not allowed? 

  However, our candidate set: m in [0, T-1]. So m+1<=T? 

  Therefore, we are safe.

But what if we have a candidate m that is T-1? Then m+1 = T? That is allowed.

Therefore, we are safe.

Let me test the sample: 
   n=3, K=1, T=100, A=[10,20,30] 
        Candidate m: 
          0, 99 (T-1), and for each a: 
              10 -> add 10,9
              20 -> add 20,19
              30 -> add 30,29
          But note: T-1=99, so 30 and 29 are <=99? So we add them? 

        Then we try m=99? 
          r = bisect_right([10,20,30],99) = 3 -> since all are <=99? 
          Then cost = (99+1)*(3-1) - P[3-1] = 100*2 - P[2] = 200 - (10+20) = 170.

        But is that the minimal? 

        Alternatively, we can set m=9? 
          r = count(A_i<=9) = 0? 
          Then we take 1 from the right? The smallest in the right is 10? 
          cost = 10 - 9 = 1.

        Then m=10? 
          r = count(A_i<=10) = 1 -> then we leave 0? So cost=0? 

        Actually: 
            if r>=K: 1>=1 -> cost = (10+1)*(1-1) - P[0] = 0.

        Why? Because we can put the subordinate at 10 in Group1? and we don't need to adjust? Then set S in (10,11). Then only the 10 is present? But we need one? 

        How about the others? 
          The ones at 20 and 30: we require them to be >=11? They are 20 and 30 -> already >=11? So we don't adjust? 

        Therefore, cost 0.

        But wait: we have the array [10,20,30]? 
          We set the meeting at 10.5? Then the subordinate at 10 is present? The others are not? 

        So cost 0? 

        But why did we get 0? 

        Therefore, the candidate m=10: 
            r = 1 -> then we leave (1-1)=0 in the left? So we don't push any? 

        So the cost is 0? 

        Then the minimal cost is 0? 

        But why didn't we consider m=10? 
            We generated m=10? because 10 is in A? 

        Then we compute 0? 

        So the output 0.

        That's correct.

Therefore, we output the code.

Note: the prefix sum array: 
   P[0]=0
   P[1]=A[0]
   P[2]=A[0]+A[1]
   ...

   For the branch r>=K: we need the sum of the smallest (r-K) elements? 
        That is the first (r-K) elements? -> P[r-K]

   For the branch else: we need the sum of the next s elements? 
        from index r to r+s-1 -> P[r+s]-P[r]

But note: the array is 0-indexed, and our prefix array P is defined such that P[i] = sum of A[0:i] (i elements from index0 to i-1).

Therefore, the code.

We'll run the sample: "4 2 4: [1,2,3,4]" for m=2: 
   r = bisect_right([1,2,3,4],2) -> the array: [1,2,3,4]; bisect_right returns the index of the first element greater than 2? which is 2 (because A[2]=3>2). So r=2? 
   Then r>=K (2>=2): 
        cost_val = (2+1)*(2-2) - P[0] = 0.

   Correct.

Sample: "4 2 4: [1,2,2,4]" for m=1: 
   r = bisect_right([1,2,2,4],1) = 1? (because A[0]=1<=1, A[1]=2>1 -> so index1) -> r=1.
   Then else: 
        s = 1
        Then we take the next 1 element: from index1? 
        The array: [1,2,2,4] -> index1 is 2? 
        Then P[1]=1? (because P[1]=A[0]=1) 
        P[2]=1+2=3? 
        Then the sum from index1 to index1 (one element) = P[2]-P[1] = 3-1=2? 
        Then cost_val = 2 - 1*1 = 1.

   Correct.

We'll run the sample: "2 1 1: [0,0]" for m=0: 
   r = bisect_right([0,0],0) = 2? 
   Then cost_val = (0+1)*(2-1) - P[1] = 1*1 - P[1] 
        P[1] = A[0] = 0? 
        so 1-0=1.

   Correct.

Therefore, we output the code.

But note: what if we have a candidate m that is negative? We don't generate negative candidates? Because we check a>=0 and a-1>=0.

What if T=0? Then we skip the general candidate generation? 

So we are safe.

One more: 
   "1 1 0: [0]" -> 
        T=0: 
            K==n? -> 1==1 -> output 0.

   "1 1 1: [0]" -> 
        T=1>0, K=1, n=1 -> then K==n? -> output 0.

   "1 1 1: [1]" -> 
        T=1, K=1, n=1 -> output 0? 
        Why? We can set S=1.5? Then the subordinate at 1 is present? So no adjustment.

   Therefore, for candidate m: 
        candidates: 
          0, T-1=0 -> candidate set {0}
          a=1: add 1 and 0 -> so {0,1}
        For m=0: 
            r = count(A_i<=0) = 0 -> then we take 1 from the right? 
            The right segment: [1]? 
            cost = (P[0+1]-P[0]) - 0*1 = (1) - 0 = 1? 

        For m=1: 
            r = count(A_i<=1) = 1 -> then cost = (1+1)*(1-1) - P[0] = 0.

        So output 0.

   Correct.

Therefore, we code accordingly.

Note: we must consider that the candidate set might have duplicates? We use a set.

We'll write the code accordingly.

Let me run the sample: 
   "2 1 0
    0 0" -> T=0 -> output -1.

   "1 1 0: [0]" -> T=0 and K==n -> output 0.

   "1 1 0: [1]" -> cannot happen because A_i must be in [0,0]? So the input says A_i in [0,0]? Then only 0? 

   Therefore, we assume the input is valid.

Code:

  import bisect
  import sys

  data = sys.stdin.read().split()
  n = int(data[0]); K = int(data[1]); T = int(data[2])
  A = list(map(int, data[3:3+n]))

  if T == 0:
      if K == n:
          print(0)
      else:
          print(-1)
      return

  if K == n:
      print(0)
      return

  A.sort()
  P = [0]*(n+1)
  for i in range(1, n+1):
      P[i] = P[i-1] + A[i-1]

  candidates = set()
  candidates.add(0)
  if T-1 >= 0:
      candidates.add(T-1)
  for a in A:
      if 0 <= a <= T-1:
          candidates.add(a)
      if 0 <= a-1 <= T-1:
          candidates.add(a-1)

  best = 10**18

  for m in candidates:
      r = bisect.bisect_right(A, m)   # number of elements <= m
      if r >= K:
          cost_val = (m+1) * (r - K) - P[r-K]   # P[r-K] = sum of the first r-K elements (which are the smallest r-K)
      else:
          s = K - r
          if r + s > n:
              continue
          cost_val = (P[r+s] - P[r]) - m * s

      if cost_val < best:
          best = cost_val

  if best == 10**18:
      print(-1)
  else:
      print(best)

But note: the sample input "2 1 0: [0,0]" is handled by the T==0 branch: output -1.

But what if we have a candidate set that is empty? Then we set best remains 10**18 -> output -1? 

But when is the candidate set empty? 
   Only if T==0? But then we skip the general case.

   Otherwise, we add 0 and T-1 (if T-1>=0) and then from A: if a in [0, T-1] we add a and a-1 (if in [0, T-1]). 

   Since 0 is always added, the candidate set is not empty? 

   Therefore, we don't need to output -1? 

   But note: what if T==1? Then T-1=0 -> we add 0. Then we have {0}. 

   Then we iterate.

   But what if we have a candidate m for which we have to skip? Only in the else branch: if r+s>n -> skip? Then we don't update best? 

   Then if all candidates are skipped? Then we output -1? 

   When would that happen? 

   Example: 
        n=3, K=3, T=10 -> but then we have K==n? So we output 0? 

        But what if we have n=3, K=3, but we are in the general case? Actually, we skip because we have a branch for K==n.

   So we only get to the candidate loop for 0<K<n.

   Then, in the else branch: we skip if r+s>n? That means there are not enough subordinates in the right? 

   But note: the entire array has n elements. Then the right segment has n - r elements. So we need s = K - r <= n - r? -> K<=n? which is true. 

   Therefore, r+s = r + (K-r) = K <= n? 

   But wait: we have the entire array? Then we can always take s from the right? 

   Why would we skip? 

   Actually: the condition is: if r+s>n -> skip? 
        r+s = r + (K - r) = K, which is <=n? 

   So we never skip? 

   But note: we are taking the next s elements? We have the array of length n? Then the segment from r to r+s-1 must be within the array? 
        r+s <= n? 
        But r+s = K, and K<=n? 

   However, what if r+s>n? 
        For example: r=5, s=3, and n=7 -> then r+s=8>7? 

   But K = r+s = 8? and n=7 -> but K cannot be greater than n? 

   Therefore, we have K<=n, so r+s=K<=n? 

   Therefore, we can remove the condition? 

   But we have: 
        r+s = K? 
        And we are taking s = K - r? 
        Then we require that we have at least s elements in the right? which is n - r? 
        And s = K - r <= n - r? -> K<=n? which is true.

   So the condition is redundant? 

   But what if the array has duplicates? Then r might be the count of the left? Then the right segment has n - r elements? 
        We need s = K - r <= n - r -> which is K<=n? 

   Therefore, we can remove the condition? 

   But let me see: 
        We are accessing P[r+s] = P[K]? 
        And we have P with indices 0..n? 

        Then if K>n? We cannot have that? 

   Therefore, we remove the condition? 

   Actually, we don't need to skip? 

   But what if we have an array of length n, and we want to take from index r to r+s-1, then we need r+s <= n? 
        Since s = K - r, and K<=n, and r>=0, then r+s = K <=n? 
        Therefore, r+s<=n? 

   But note: P has indices from 0 to n? So we can do P[r+s] as long as r+s<=n? 

   Therefore, we can remove the condition.

   However, to be safe, we can note that since K<=n, we don't need to check? 

   So we remove the condition.

   Then the else branch becomes:
        s = K - r
        cost_val = (P[r+s] - P[r]) - m * s

   But note: r+s = K, which is at most n? 

   But what if r+s = n? Then we use P[n]? Which we have? 

   Therefore, we remove the condition.

   Then the code for the else branch is always executed? 

   But what if K==0? 
        Then we would have K==0, but we have a branch for K==n? and also for T==0? 
        And we are in the general case only for 0<K<n? 

        So K is at least 1 and at most n-1? 

        Then s = K - r >=1? and r+s = K <= n? 

   Therefore, we can remove the condition.

   Revised:

      for m in candidates:
          r = bisect.bisect_right(A, m)
          if r >= K:
              cost_val = (m+1) * (r - K) - P[r-K]
          else:
              s = K - r
              cost_val = (P[r+s] - P[r]) - m * s

          if cost_val < best:
              best = cost_val

   Then output best? 

   But what if we have negative cost? 
        We are doing adjustments: the cost is nonnegative? 
        But note: 
            In the if branch: 
                (m+1)*(r-K) is nonnegative? and P[r-K] is the sum of the smallest r-K? 
                And (m+1)*(r-K) >= the sum? 
                Why? Because each element in the smallest r-K is at most m? So the sum <= m*(r-K)? 
                Then (m+1)*(r-K) - sum >= (m+1)*(r-K) - m*(r-K) = (r-K) >=0? 

            In the else branch: 
                The smallest s in the right are at least m+1? So each element >= m+1? 
                Then the sum >= s*(m+1)? 
                Then cost_val = (sum) - m*s >= s*(m+1) - m*s = s? >=0.

        Therefore, the cost is nonnegative.

   So we are safe.

   But note: the sample: 
        "4 2 4: [1,2,3,4]" for m=2: 0.

   We'll run the sample: 
        "2 1 1: [0,0]" for m=0: 1.

   Therefore, we output the code.

   Let me test a new sample: 
        n=3, K=2, T=10, A = [1, 3, 5]
        We want to have exactly 2? 

        Candidates: 
            0, 9, and for a in [1,3,5]: 
                a=1: add 1,0 -> {0,1,9}
                a=3: add 3,2 -> {0,1,2,3,9}
                a=5: add 5,4 -> {0,1,2,3,4,5,9}

        We'll try m=0: 
            r = count(A_i<=0)=0 -> cost = (P[0+2]-P[0]) - 0*2 = (A[0]+A[1]) = 1+3 = 4? 
        m=1: 
            r = count(A_i<=1)=1 -> cost = (1+1)*(1-2) ... wait: 1>=2? no -> else: s=1 -> cost = (P[1+1]-P[1]) - 1*1 = (A[0]+A[1] - A[0]) - 1 = A[1] - 1 = 3-1=2? 
        m=2: 
            r = count(A_i<=2)=1 -> cost = (P[1+1]-P[1]) - 2*1 = (A[0]+A[1] - A[0]) - 2 = 3-2=1? 
        m=3: 
            r = count(A_i<=3)=2 -> if branch: 
                cost = (3+1)*(2-2) - P[0] = 0? 
            How? 
                We have two subordinates at 1 and 3? We set the meeting at 3.5? Then they are both present? 
                The third at 5? We don't need to adjust? 
            So cost 0? 

        Then minimal cost=0? 

        Therefore, output 0.

        But wait: we don't need to adjust? So cost 0? 

        Then candidate m=3: cost 0.

        So the answer 0.

        Therefore, we output 0.

   Correct.

   Therefore, the code.

   But note: we have to consider the entire candidate set? Because the minimal cost might be at m=3? 

   We generated m=3? 

   Therefore, we output 0.

   Therefore, the code is complete.

   We'll write accordingly.

   Note: the prefix sum array: 
        P[0]=0
        P[1]=A[0]
        P[2]=A[0]+A[1]
        P[3]=A[0]+A[1]+A[2]

   For m=3 in the above: 
        r = bisect_right([1,3,5],3) = 2? (because 3<=3, and then 5>3 -> index2? which is the count=2)
        Then cost_val = (3+1)*(2-2) - P[0] = 0.

   Correct.

   But note: in the if branch, we use P[r-K]? 
        r-K = 0? Then P[0]=0.

   Correct.

   Therefore, we output the code.
