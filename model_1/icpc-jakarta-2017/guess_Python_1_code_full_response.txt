To solve this problem, we need to reconstruct Romanos' guesses in a number guessing game where Theodora provides answers that maximize the remaining range of possible numbers. Romanos makes up to K guesses, and Theodora's answers are given. The goal is to determine a sequence of guesses consistent with the answers or conclude that it's impossible.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - Theodora picks a number between 1 and N.
   - Romanos makes up to K guesses. For each guess, Theodora responds with '<', '>', or '='.
   - The game ends if Romanos guesses correctly (he wins) or after K wrong guesses (he loses).
   - Theodora answers adversarially to maximize the remaining range of possible numbers, breaking ties by choosing '<'.
   - Given the sequence of Theodora's answers, we need to find a sequence of Romanos' guesses consistent with these answers or determine that no such sequence exists.

2. **Key Insights**:
   - **Precompute Minimum Interval Sizes**: For each position in the answer string, compute the minimal size of the interval required to accommodate the remaining answers. This ensures that after each guess, the updated interval can support subsequent answers.
   - **Simulate the Game**:
     - Start with the initial interval [1, N].
     - For each answer, choose a guess within the current interval that satisfies Theodora's answer and ensures the updated interval is non-empty and large enough for the remaining answers.
     - Update the interval based on the answer:
       - For '<', the new interval is [L, guess-1].
       - For '>', the new interval is [guess+1, R].
       - For '=', the interval must be a singleton (L == R).

3. **Algorithm Selection**:
   - **Precomputation**: Traverse the answer string backwards to compute `min_size`, where `min_size[i]` is the minimal interval size needed at step `i`.
   - **Simulation**:
     - For each answer, check if the current interval size is at least `min_size[i]`. If not, output `-1`.
     - For '=', ensure the interval is a singleton; otherwise, output `-1`.
     - For '<' or '>', compute the guess using bounds derived from Theodora's strategy and the next interval size requirement. Update the interval accordingly.

4. **Complexity Analysis**:
   - **Time Complexity**: O(K), where K is the number of guesses. Each step involves constant-time operations.
   - **Space Complexity**: O(K), to store the `min_size` array and the output guesses.

```python
import sys

def main():
    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()
    if not data:
        return
    first_line = data[0].split()
    if not first_line:
        return
    N = int(first_line[0])
    K = int(first_line[1])
    s = data[1].strip()
    M = len(s)
    
    min_size = [0] * M
    if M > 0:
        if s[-1] == '=':
            min_size[M-1] = 1
        else:
            min_size[M-1] = 2
        for i in range(M-2, -1, -1):
            min_size[i] = min_size[i+1] + 1
    
    L = 1
    R = N
    guesses = []
    
    for i in range(M):
        if R < L:
            print(-1)
            return
            
        current_size = R - L + 1
        if current_size < min_size[i]:
            print(-1)
            return
            
        c = s[i]
        if c == '=':
            if i != M-1:
                print(-1)
                return
            else:
                if L == R:
                    guesses.append(L)
                else:
                    print(-1)
                    return
        else:
            if i == M-1:
                next_min = 1
            else:
                next_min = min_size[i+1]
                
            if c == '<':
                cand1 = (L + R + 1) // 2
                cand2 = L + next_min
                g = cand1 if cand1 > cand2 else cand2
                if g > R:
                    print(-1)
                    return
                guesses.append(g)
                R = g - 1
            else:
                cand1 = (L + R - 1) // 2
                cand2 = R - next_min
                g = cand1 if cand1 < cand2 else cand2
                if g < L:
                    print(-1)
                    return
                guesses.append(g)
                L = g + 1
                
    print(" ".join(str(x) for x in guesses))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, N (the range of numbers) and K (maximum guesses), and a string `s` representing Theodora's answers.
2. **Precomputing `min_size`**:
   - For the last character in `s`, if it's '=', `min_size` is 1; otherwise, it's 2.
   - For preceding characters, `min_size[i]` is `min_size[i+1] + 1`.
3. **Simulating the Game**:
   - Initialize the interval [L, R] as [1, N].
   - For each answer in `s`:
     - If the current interval size is less than `min_size[i]`, output `-1`.
     - For '=', ensure the interval is a singleton; append the number and exit.
     - For '<' or '>', compute the guess using bounds derived from Theodora's strategy and update the interval.
4. **Output**: Print the sequence of guesses if valid; otherwise, print `-1`.

This approach efficiently checks the feasibility of the sequence of guesses while adhering to Theodora's adversarial strategy, ensuring correctness within the problem constraints.
