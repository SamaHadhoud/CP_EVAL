### Approach
The problem involves determining whether there exists a safe path between two fire lookout towers in a rectangular area, avoiding any burning hotspots. The towers are located at opposite corners of the rectangle, and hotspots are circular regions. A point is safe if it lies within the rectangle and is not strictly inside any hotspot. 

#### Key Insight
The solution leverages graph theory to model potential barriers formed by the hotspots. The key idea is that if there exists a connected chain of hotspots (or parts of them) that either connects the left and right boundaries or the top and bottom boundaries of the rectangle, then the rectangle is divided into separate regions. If such a barrier exists, the two towers (located at opposite corners) cannot be connected by a safe path. 

#### Algorithm Selection
1. **Filter Relevant Hotspots**: Only consider hotspots that intersect the rectangle. A hotspot intersects the rectangle if the distance from its center to the nearest point in the rectangle is less than its radius.
2. **Graph Construction**:
   - **Nodes**: Represent each relevant hotspot and four additional nodes for the rectangle boundaries (left, right, bottom, top).
   - **Edges**:
     - Between two hotspots if their circles overlap (i.e., the distance between centers is at most the sum of their radii).
     - Between a hotspot and a boundary if the hotspot covers any part of that boundary (i.e., the distance from the hotspot's center to the boundary segment is less than its radius).
3. **Connectivity Check**: Use BFS to check for a path between:
   - Left and right boundaries (indicating a vertical barrier).
   - Bottom and top boundaries (indicating a horizontal barrier).
   If either path exists, the towers cannot communicate; otherwise, they can.

### Explanation
1. **Input Parsing**: The first line contains the coordinates of the two towers (defining the rectangle) and the number of hotspots. Subsequent lines describe each hotspot's center and radius.
2. **Filtering Hotspots**: For each hotspot, calculate the minimal distance from its center to the rectangle. If this distance is less than the hotspot's radius, it intersects the rectangle and is retained.
3. **Graph Construction**:
   - **Boundary Nodes**: Four nodes represent the rectangle's boundaries (left, right, bottom, top).
   - **Hotspot-Boundary Edges**: Connect a hotspot to a boundary node if the hotspot covers any part of that boundary.
   - **Hotspot-Hotspot Edges**: Connect two hotspots if their circular regions overlap.
4. **Connectivity Check**: Using BFS, check if there's a path between:
   - Left and right boundaries (indicating a vertical barrier).
   - Bottom and top boundaries (indicating a horizontal barrier).
5. **Result**: If either path exists, output "NO" (no safe path between towers); otherwise, output "YES".

This approach efficiently checks for barriers formed by hotspots, ensuring optimal performance even with the upper constraint of 1000 hotspots. The BFS ensures linear time complexity relative to the number of nodes and edges.
