 Okay, we are going to solve the problem by following the editorial guidelines.

 Steps:
 1. Preprocessing: For each country name, build a mapping from each character to the sorted list of indices where it appears.
 2. Sort the countries lexicographically (by their names) but remember the original index to output the codes in the input order.
 3. We will assign codes to the countries in sorted order. For the first country, we assign the lexicographically smallest valid code (subsequence of length K starting with the first character). For each subsequent country, we must assign a code that is lexicographically greater than the previous country's code and also valid.

 How to generate the lexicographically smallest code for a country that is at least a given string `prev`?
    We can design a function `find_code_geq(S, prev, K, pos_map)` that returns the lexicographically smallest code (subsequence of S of length K, starting with S[0]) that is >= `prev`, or returns null if not possible.

 However, note the constraints: the total length of all country names is at most 200,000, and K up to 200, but N is only up to 1000.

 Alternatively, we can break the problem into two parts for each country (after the first one):
   a. Try to assign a code that is lexicographically equal to the previous code? But we cannot have the same code (because then the lex order of the country names must be the same as the codes, and the countries are distinct and sorted by name). So we need strictly greater.

   b. Actually, for the next country we have two possibilities:
        Option 1: The lexicographically smallest code that is >= `prev` might be `prev` itself. But if we get `prev`, then we cannot use it because we require strictly greater? Actually, no: the condition is that the country names are in increasing order and the codes must be in the same increasing order. Since the current country name is lexicographically greater than the previous, we must have a code that is strictly greater than the previous.

   So we can do:
        candidate = find_code_geq(S, prev, K, pos_map)   -> this gives the smallest code >= prev.
        If candidate is not found -> then it's impossible.
        If candidate > prev -> then we can use candidate.

        If candidate == prev, then we have to generate the next code after `prev` that is valid for the country. We can design a function `next_code_helper(S, prev, K, pos_map)` that returns the lexicographically smallest code for S that is strictly greater than `prev` (if exists).

 4. Implementation of `find_code_geq`:
      We traverse the string S to build a code of length K. We know the first character must be the same as the country's first letter. So if the country name starts with a letter that is less than the first character of `prev`, then we have a problem? Actually, the country name's first character must be the same as the code's first character. And `prev` is the previous country's code. Since the country names are sorted, the current country name must start with a letter that is at least the same as the previous country name? Not necessarily: they could start with the same letter.

      However, note: the first character of the code must be the same as the country's first character. So the first character of `prev` must be <= the current country's first character? Actually, if the current country name starts with a letter that is less than the first letter of `prev`, then we cannot have a code >= `prev`? So we can check: if the country name's first character is less than `prev[0]` -> return None. If it is greater, then we can form a code that is greater by having the first character greater. But if equal, then we have to match the first character.

      Steps for `find_code_geq`:
          Let n = len(S)
          We are going to build the code character by character. We maintain:
             current_index: the last index we took in S (for the last character of the code so far). Initially, we haven't taken any, but the first character must be at index0? Actually, the first character must be the first letter of the country? Actually, the first character of the code must be the same as the country's first character, which is S[0]. So we set:
                 res[0] = S[0] (so the first character is fixed).
                 current_index = 0   (we use the first character at index0)

          But note: the condition for the first character: we require that the entire code is >= `prev`. The first character must be >= `prev[0]`. Since we have S[0] as the first character, if S[0] < prev[0] -> impossible -> return None.
          If S[0] > prev[0]: then we can choose the rest arbitrarily (the smallest possible) and we are free to choose the rest arbitrarily (as long as they form a subsequence) and we will be greater.

          However, if S[0] == prev[0], then we are bound to choose the next characters to be at least the next of `prev`.

          So we maintain a flag `bound` that indicates we are still bounded by `prev`.

          For position j in [0, K-1]:
              We need to choose a character at position j such that:
                 If we are bound (meaning we have matched the prefix of `prev` so far) then we must choose a character >= `prev[j]`.
                 Otherwise, we can choose any character from 'A' to 'Z' (but we want the lexicographically smallest).

              We try from the lower bound to 'Z' until we find a character that we can pick at a position that leaves enough room for the remaining K - j - 1 characters.

          How to check for a character c at position j?
              We need to pick an occurrence of c in S at an index > current_index and <= (n - (K - j - 1)) [so that we have enough characters after].

          We have the `pos_map` for the country: which maps c to a sorted list of indices.

          So for j=0: we already set the first character.

          For j>=1:
             L = current_index + 1
             R = n - (K - j)   [because we need to leave at least (K - j - 1) characters after this one]

             Then we iterate from the lower bound to 'Z' to find the first character c that has an occurrence in [L, R]. The first such c we find is the best.

          Then update:
             current_index = the chosen index for c
             If we are bound and the chosen c is greater than `prev[j]`, then we break the bound (so for the next positions we are free).

          If we cannot find a character for a position, return None.

 5. Implementation of `next_code_helper`:
        This function is called when we have a candidate that is exactly `prev` (so we want the next lexicographic code for the same country that is strictly greater than `prev`).

        How?
          We know the positions where the characters of `prev` appear in S (if they appear in increasing indices). We can try to find the next code by:

          Step: We try to change the code from the last character backwards. We want to change a character at some position i to a greater one and then complete the rest as small as possible.

          We can simulate the positions of `prev` in S: we try to match `prev` in S? Actually, we know that `prev` is a subsequence of S? Not necessarily: we know that we found a code that equals `prev` by the previous function? Actually, the function `find_code_geq` returned `prev` so we know that `prev` is a valid subsequence.

          So we know the positions in S for the code `prev`? Actually, in `find_code_geq` we did not record the indices, but we can recompute the positions for `prev` in the current country name? We can do:

          Let occ = []: the positions for each character of `prev` in S (for the current country). We can get the minimal occurrence: for the first character, we take the first occurrence of `prev[0]` which must be at 0? Actually, the first character must be at the beginning? But note: the country name might have multiple occurrences of the same character. We have to choose the one that forms the subsequence for `prev`.

          How to get the minimal occurrence? Actually, we can greedily: for the i-th character, we choose the first occurrence after the previous occurrence. We can use the `pos_map` to do that.

          Then, we try from the last character backwards:

            For i from K-1 down to 0:
                We try to change the i-th character to a bigger one. The position of the i-th character in S is occ[i]. We try to choose a character c > `prev[i]` that appears in the substring starting from (occ[i-1]+1 if i>0 else 0) to (n - (K-i-1)). If we find such a character, then we can set the i-th character to the smallest such c, and then complete the rest (from i+1 to the end) with the lexicographically smallest subsequence.

          How to complete the rest? We can call a function `greedy_suffix(S, start_index, length, pos_map, n)` that returns the lexicographically smallest subsequence of S (of given `length`) that starts at `start_index` (and the indices must be in increasing order and within the bounds).

          If we find such a candidate at position i, we form the new code: prefix (prev[0:i]) + the new character + the greedy suffix of length (K - i - 1).

          If we cannot change at position i, then we backtrack to the previous position.

          If we cannot change any position, then return None.

 6. However, note: we might not have the occurrence of `prev` stored? Actually, we know `prev` was found by `find_code_geq` so we know it exists. But we need the exact positions? We can simulate the positions:

        occ = []
        current_index = -1
        for each character c in prev:
            In the list for c in pos_map, we find the first index > current_index. Then we set current_index to that index and record it.

        Then we try to change at each position from the last to the first.

 7. Implementation of `greedy_suffix`:
        We want the lexicographically smallest subsequence of length `length` from S starting at index `start_index` (meaning we can only use indices >= start_index) and we must have at least `length` characters from start_index to the end.

        We traverse from start_index and for each position we pick the smallest character that allows the rest? Actually, we can do:

          res = []
          current = start_index
          for j in range(length):
              R_bound = n - (length - j - 1)   # we can use at most up to R_bound for the current character
              We try from 'A' to 'Z': 
                  For a character c, we look in the list of positions for c (in the current country) that is >= current and <= R_bound.
                  The first such character we find is the one we choose.

          Then we set current = (chosen index) + 1 for the next character.

        If we cannot form a subsequence of length `length` starting from `start_index`, return None.

 8. Putting it all together:

        For each country in sorted order (by name):
          if it is the first:
              code = find_code_geq(name, "A"*K, K, pos_map)   # but note: we want the lexicographically smallest, which is at least "A"*K? Actually, we can set the previous code to be all 'A's? But the first character must be the country's first character, so we can set prev_code = [first_char] + (K-1)*'A'? But that might not be the lexicographically smallest.

          Actually, we can set the initial `prev_code` to a string of K times the smallest character? But note: the first character is fixed to the country's first character. So we want the lexicographically smallest code for the first country.

          How? We can set the previous code to be the minimal possible code: the first character and then the next K-1 smallest characters that can form a subsequence? But the function `find_code_geq` when called with a string of all 'A' might not be efficient? Actually, we can set the lower bound to the first character at the first position and then the rest to 'A'. But we want the lexicographically smallest.

          Actually, we can set `prev_code` for the first country to be the lexicographically smallest code. We can call `find_code_geq(name, S0 + (K-1)*'A', K, pos_map)`? But note: we want the smallest. We can set the bound string as: the first character and then (K-1) times the smallest character? Actually, the minimal code would be: first character and then the next K-1 smallest available characters (which might be 'A' if available).

          Alternatively, we can set the bound to a string that is the first character and then (K-1) times the letter 'A'. But if the country name does not have enough 'A's? Then we might not get the minimal.

          Actually, we can set the bound to the first character and then (K-1) times the smallest letter that appears? But we want the minimal lexicographic code.

          How about: we set the bound to the first character and then (K-1) times the letter 'A'. Then we call `find_code_geq` with that bound. The function will then return the smallest code that is >= that bound? That is the lexicographically smallest code that we can form? Actually, the lexicographically smallest code might start with the first character and then the smallest available character that leaves room for the rest.

          But note: the function `find_code_geq` is designed to return the lexicographically smallest code that is >= the bound. So if we set the bound to a string that is too low, we get the minimal. So for the first country, we set the bound to a string of K times the letter 'A'. However, the first character must be the country's first character. So we can set:

            bound0 = country_names[0][0] + ('A' * (K-1))

          But note: if the country name does not have the next K-1 'A's? Then the function will have to pick a letter that is greater than 'A' for the second position? Then we get the minimal.

          However, we can set the bound to be the first character and then K-1 times the letter 'A'. But if the country's first character is 'A', then the bound is "A"*K. Otherwise, if the country's first character is greater than 'A', then we are free to choose the rest arbitrarily? Actually, the bound we set must have the first character as the country's first character. So we set:

            bound0 = country_names[0][0] + ('A' * (K-1))

          But if the country's first character is 'Z', then the bound is "Z" + (K-1)*'A'. Then the function will try to form a code that is >= that bound. That is the minimal code for that country? Actually, the minimal code for a country starting with 'Z' would be "Z" followed by the next K-1 smallest available characters (which might be 'A' if available). So this bound is the minimal.

          So for the first country, we set the bound to: first_char + (K-1)*'A'

        Then for the next countries, we set the bound to the previous country's code (and we require strictly greater for the entire list, but note: we can get a candidate that is equal and then we have to try to find the next one).

 9. However, note: the problem says the country names are distinct and sorted, so the current country name is strictly greater than the previous? Actually, the sorted list: if two country names are the same? The problem says no two countries share the same country name. So they are strictly increasing.

        Therefore, we must assign a code that is strictly greater than the previous.

        So for the first country: we assign the minimal code (lexicographically smallest valid).

        For the i-th country (i>=1):
            candidate = find_code_geq(name, prev_code, K, pos_map)   # smallest code >= prev_code
            if candidate is None -> "NO"
            else if candidate > prev_code -> assign candidate and set prev_code = candidate.

            else (candidate == prev_code) -> then we must find the next code that is strictly greater: next_candidate = next_code_helper(name, prev_code, K, pos_map)
            if next_candidate is None -> "NO", else assign next_candidate and set prev_code = next_candidate.

 10. Finally, we output the codes in the original order.

 Implementation details:

    We store for each country the mapping from char to sorted indices.

    We sort the countries by name, and remember the original index.

    We maintain `prev_code` as the last assigned code.

    We iterate over the sorted list.

    We must implement:
        - `find_code_geq(S, prev, K, pos_map)`
        - `next_code_helper(S, prev, K, pos_map)`
        - `greedy_suffix(S, start, length, pos_map, n)`   [n = len(S)]

    Note: We assume that the string S is the country name.

    Important: In `find_code_geq`, the bound condition: we break the bound if we choose a character greater than the corresponding character in `prev`.

    Also note: if the length of the country name is less than K, then we return None immediately? Actually, we have the constraint that the country name length is at least 1, and the total length of all names is 200,000. But we can check at the beginning: if len(S) < K: return None.

    However, the problem says: the country name length is between 1 and 200,000. So we must check.

    Steps for `find_code_geq`:

        n = len(S)
        if n < K: return None

        # The first character must be S[0]? Actually, the rule says the first letter of the code must be the same as the country name's first letter. So we set the first character to S[0].

        if S[0] < prev[0]: 
            return None
        # Now, if S[0] > prev[0]: then we are free to choose the rest as the smallest possible? But note: we must form a subsequence of length K. So we can take the first character at index0, and then the next K-1 smallest available characters? Actually, we can use a greedy: we take the smallest character available at the earliest positions.

        Let res = [S[0]]
        current_index = 0   # the index in S of the last chosen character (for the first character, we use index0)

        bound = (S[0] == prev[0])   # if we are still bound by the prefix of `prev`

        For j from 1 to K-1:
            L = current_index + 1
            R = n - (K - j - 1)   # because we need K-j more characters (including the current) and we are going to pick one at position in [L, R] so that we leave K-j-1 characters for the rest.

            If L > R: return None

            If we are bound, then the current character must be >= prev[j]. Otherwise, we can start from 'A'.

            Let low_bound = prev[j] if bound else 'A'

            candidate_char = None
            candidate_index = None

            For c from low_bound to 'Z':
                if c is not in pos_map, skip.
                In the list for c, we look for the first index >= L and <= R.
                If found, we set candidate_char = c, candidate_index = that index, and break.

            If candidate_char is None: return None.

            Append candidate_char to res.
            current_index = candidate_index

            If bound and candidate_char > prev[j]:
                bound = False   # we broke the bound, so the rest can be arbitrary

        Return the string ''.join(res)

    Steps for `greedy_suffix(S, start, length, pos_map, n)`:

        if length == 0: return ""
        current = start
        res = []
        for j in range(length):
            R_bound = n - (length - j - 1)   # the last character we can choose for the j-th in the suffix must be at most R_bound (so that we have at least (length - j - 1) characters after it)
            found_char = None
            found_index = None
            for c in "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ":   # from 'A' to 'Z'
                if c not in pos_map:
                    continue
                arr = pos_map[c]
                pos = bisect.bisect_left(arr, current)
                if pos < len(arr) and arr[pos] <= R_bound:
                    found_char = c
                    found_index = arr[pos]
                    break
            if found_char is None:
                return None
            res.append(found_char)
            current = found_index + 1
        return ''.join(res)

    Steps for `next_code_helper(S, prev, K, pos_map)`:

        n = len(S)
        # First, we find the positions of the characters in `prev` in S (the minimal positions that form the subsequence). We do:

        occ = []
        current = -1
        for i in range(K):
            c = prev[i]
            if c not in pos_map:
                return None
            arr = pos_map[c]
            pos = bisect.bisect_left(arr, current+1)
            if pos >= len(arr):
                return None
            occ.append(arr[pos])
            current = arr[pos]

        # Now, we try to change the code from the last character backwards.
        for i in range(K-1, -1, -1):
            # For position i, we want to change the character to a greater one.
            # The next character must be > prev[i] and must appear in the segment: 
            #   If i==0: from index 0 to n - (K-0-1) = n - (K-1) [but note: we are changing the i-th character, and then we have to complete K-i-1 characters after]
            #   If i>0: from occ[i-1]+1 to n - (K-i-1) (because we have to leave K-i-1 characters after this one).

            if i == 0:
                L_bound = 0
            else:
                L_bound = occ[i-1] + 1
            R_bound = n - (K - i - 1)   # because after the current character we need K-i-1 characters.

            if L_bound > R_bound:
                continue   # cannot change at this position, backtrack to previous

            # We try to find a character c > prev[i] that appears in the interval [L_bound, R_bound] and then we can complete the rest with the greedy_suffix for the remaining K-i-1 characters.

            current_char = prev[i]
            found_char = None
            found_index = None
            for c_code in range(ord(current_char)+1, ord('Z')+1):
                c = chr(c_code)
                if c not in pos_map:
                    continue
                arr = pos_map[c]
                pos = bisect.bisect_left(arr, L_bound)
                if pos < len(arr) and arr[pos] <= R_bound:
                    found_char = c
                    found_index = arr[pos]
                    break

            if found_char is None:
                continue   # try the next position to the left

            # Now, we have changed the i-th character to found_char. Now we need to form the suffix of length (K-i-1) starting from found_index+1.
            suffix = greedy_suffix(S, found_index+1, K-i-1, pos_map, n)
            if suffix is None:
                continue   # try next character or next position

            # Then the new code is: prev[0:i] + found_char + suffix
            new_code = prev[:i] + found_char + suffix
            return new_code

        return None   # if no position can be changed

 11. Edge: if K==0? But K>=1.

 12. We must be cautious: the country names might be long, but the total length is bounded (200,000). And K is at most 200, and N is at most 1000.

    However, in `find_code_geq` and `next_code_helper` we are iterating over at most 26*K per country? Actually, in `find_code_geq` for each of the K positions we iterate at most 26 letters -> 26*K per country. Since K<=200 and N<=1000, worst-case 1000*200*26 = 5,200,000 which is acceptable.

    Similarly, in `next_code_helper` we iterate backwards over K positions, and for each we iterate at most 26 letters? Then the greedy_suffix is O(26*(K-i))? So worst-case O(26*K) per position? Then worst-case O(26*K^2) per country? Which is 26*200*200 = 1,040,000 per country? Then worst-case 1000 * 1,040,000 = 1,040,000,000 which is 1e9 operations? This might be borderline in C++ in 1 second? But note: the greedy_suffix is only called once per position that we try to change? And we break at the first position that works. Also, we are iterating from the last character backwards, so we hope that we change a character near the end? But worst-case we might have to go until the first character.

    Alternatively, we can optimize the greedy_suffix: it is O(26*length) which is acceptable because the length is at most 200? So worst-case 26*200 = 5200 per call? Then worst-case for `next_code_helper`: we might try up to K positions and for each we try up to 26 characters? Then worst-case 26*K * (cost of greedy_suffix) = 26*200*5200 = 26 * 1,040,000 = 27,040,000 per country? Then for 1000 countries: 27e9, which is too high.

    We need to avoid worst-case.

    Actually, we break at the first character we can change. So we don't try all positions? We break when we find one. So the inner loop (over positions) is from last to first and we break at the first successful change. So we only do one greedy_suffix per country? And the greedy_suffix is O(26* (remaining length)) which is O(26*200) = 5200 per call? Then the entire `next_code_helper` does:

        - Building the occ: O(K) per country? (with K<=200) -> 200.
        - Then for each i from K-1 down to 0: we try at most 26*(number of characters to try) and then one greedy_suffix.

        The greedy_suffix is called at most once per position we try? But we break when we find a candidate. So worst-case we try one position and one character? Then the cost is 5200 per call? Then total per country: 200 (for occ) + 26 * (number of positions we try) * (cost per character try) [which is constant] + 5200? Actually, the inner loop over characters: we break at the first character that has an occurrence and then we call greedy_suffix. Then worst-case per position: 26 * (one bisect) which is O(26*log(|arr|))? Then worst-case we might try all positions? Then worst-case K * (26 * log(n)) which is acceptable? (log(n) is about 18 for n=200000). Then worst-case 200 * (26 * 18) which is 93600 per country? Then 1000 * 93600 = 93,600,000 which is acceptable.

    But note: when we break? Actually, we break at the first position that we can change and complete the suffix. So we don't try all positions? We break at the first one that works. So the total cost might be much lower.

    However, worst-case we might try all positions? Then we do K positions. For each position, we try up to 26 letters? Then we call greedy_suffix for each candidate letter? Actually, no: we break at the first candidate letter that appears? But note: we are iterating the letters in increasing order. We break at the first candidate letter that appears and then we call greedy_suffix. If greedy_suffix fails, then we continue to the next candidate letter? Then worst-case we might try 26 letters per position? Then worst-case 26 * K * (cost of greedy_suffix) = 26*200*5200 = 27,040,000 per country? Then 1000 * 27e6 = 27e9 which is too high in C++.

    We need to optimize:

        - The greedy_suffix: we are building a string of length L (which is at most 200) by scanning 26 letters per position. The cost is O(26*L) per greedy_suffix. So worst-case 26*200 = 5200 per call.

        - Then worst-case per position: 26 * 5200 = 135200 per position? Then per country: 200 * 135200 = 27,040,000 per country? Then 1000 * 27e6 = 27e9, which is 27 seconds? We need to avoid this.

    How to avoid? We note that we break as soon as we find a candidate letter that we can use and then the greedy_suffix succeeds? So we don't try all letters? But worst-case we might have to try all 26 letters per position? Then worst-case per position: 26 * 5200 = 135200, and then 200 * 135200 = 27e6 per country? Then 1000 * 27e6 = 27e9? Actually, worst-case 27e9 operations? That might be too high in C++? We need to hope that the greedy_suffix fails quickly? But worst-case we have to try all letters until we find one that works? And the greedy_suffix is O(26*L) and we do it for each candidate letter.

    Alternatively, we can avoid calling greedy_suffix until we know the letter is available? Actually, we already check the letter is available at the required segment? But that doesn't guarantee that the suffix exists. So we have to check.

    We can precompute a structure to quickly check if we can form a subsequence of length L from a starting index? But we are building the lexicographically smallest one? Actually, we need the entire suffix? So we have to build it.

    How to optimize the entire solution? We note that the constraints on the total length of all country names is 200,000, but we are building the pos_map for each country? That is acceptable.

    But worst-case 27e9 operations for the entire input? We must avoid worst-case.

    Alternative idea for `next_code_helper`:

        Instead of iterating over every candidate letter and then building the entire suffix, we can first check if there is any possibility to complete the suffix without building it? We can precompute a DP for subsequence automaton? But note: the total length of all country names is 200,000, and K is 200, so we could precompute a next_pos array? But we are building for each country separately? Then we cannot share.

    Actually, we can precompute for each country a DP for the minimal next positions? But we have the pos_map, and we can compute the greedy suffix without the inner loop? Actually, the greedy_suffix is already efficient: O(26*L) per call? And we are only calling it at most 26*K per country? But worst-case 26*K * (26*L) is 26*K * (26*(K-i))? Actually, the length L is K-i-1? So worst-case 26*K * (26*(K)) = 26*26*K^2, which is 26*26*200*200 = 26*26*40000 = 27,040,000 per country? Then 1000 * 27e6 = 27e9? This is too high.

    We must hope that the test cases are not worst-case? Or we need a better approach.

    Alternatively, we can change the algorithm for `next_code_helper`:

        Instead of iterating backwards and for each position trying every candidate letter, we can do:

          We know the current occurrence sequence for `prev`. We try to increase the last character? Then we break. But if we cannot, then we backtrack. But we are doing that.

        How to avoid building the entire greedy_suffix for every candidate letter? We can precompute for the current country the next occurrence array? Actually, we can precompute an array `next_pos` for the entire string? But that would be expensive per country? And we have 1000 countries.

        Alternatively, we can precompute for each country a "next occurrence" table: `next_occurrence[i][c]` = the next occurrence of character c starting at index i? That would be a 2D array: 200000 * 26 per country? Total memory: 1000 * 200000 * 26 * sizeof(int) = 1000 * 200000 * 26 * 4 = 1000*20,800,000 = 20,800,000,000 bytes? 20.8 GB? Not acceptable.

    We stick to the pos_map (which is a dictionary of sorted lists) and use binary search? Then the greedy_suffix is:

        for j in range(length):
            We need to pick a character at a position >= current and <= R_bound (which is n - (length - j - 1)).
            For each candidate letter from 'A' to 'Z', we check: is there an occurrence of the letter in the list at an index in [current, R_bound]?

            We do a binary search in the list for the letter: we want the first occurrence >= current. Then we check if it <= R_bound.

            Then we pick the smallest letter that satisfies.

        The cost per j: 26 * (log(size of list)).

        Then total cost per greedy_suffix: 26 * (log(n)) * length? Actually, we do 26 * (log(n)) per j? Then total O(26 * log(n) * length). Since length <=200, then 26 * 18 * 200 = 93,600 per greedy_suffix? Then worst-case for `next_code_helper`: we do 26 * K * (cost per greedy_suffix) = 26 * 200 * 93600 = 26 * 200 * 93600 = 487,680,000 per country? Then 1000 * 487e6 = 487e9, which is 487 seconds? Too high.

    We need a better greedy_suffix? 

        Actually, we can precompute for the entire country name the next occurrence for a character from a given start? But we have the pos_map: we can use binary search on the sorted list for each character. Then the greedy_suffix can be implemented by:

            for each j in range(length):
                We try the letters from 'A' to 'Z'
                For each letter, we do a binary search in the sorted list for that letter to find the first occurrence >= current and <= R_bound.

            We break when we find the first letter that has such an occurrence.

        The cost per j is 26 * log(size of list) per character? So worst-case 26 * log(n) per j? Then total 26 * log(n) * length.

        But note: we break at the first letter that has an occurrence? So worst-case we might try 26 letters per j? Then yes, 26 * log(n) per j, and j from 0 to length-1 -> 26 * log(n) * length.

        Then worst-case 26 * 18 * 200 = 93600 per greedy_suffix.

        Then worst-case for `next_code_helper`: we try 26*K = 26*200 = 5200 candidate letters? Then 5200 * 93600 = 5200 * 93600 = 487,680,000 per country? Then 1000 countries: 487,680,000,000 operations? That is 487.68e9 operations? In C++, one operation might be a few cycles? 1e9 operations per second? Then 487 seconds? Too high.

    We must optimize:

        We can precompute for the entire country name an array `min_char_from[i]` for each index i? But we want the entire suffix? Actually, we can precompute an array `next_occurrence` for each starting index and for each character? That would be too heavy.

    Alternatively, we can precompute for the entire country a DP array: `dp[i][j]` = the minimal next occurrence from index i for a subsequence of length j? But j up to 200? Then memory 200000*200 = 40e6 per country? Then 1000*40e6 = 40e9 integers? 160 GB? Not acceptable.

    We need a different approach.

    Let me change the algorithm for `next_code_helper`:

        We want to find the next lexicographic code after `prev` for the country S.

        We can do a DFS? But the code length is 200? Then worst-case 26^200? Not possible.

    We stick to the backtracking from the end, but we avoid building the entire greedy_suffix for every candidate letter? Instead, we can check the existence of a subsequence of a given length from a starting index without building it? We can precompute a "next occurrence" table for the entire string? Specifically:

        We can precompute an array `next_occurrence` for the entire country name: 
            Let `next_occurrence[i][c]` = the smallest index >= i where the character c appears, or a big number if not exists.

        Then we can use a DP for the maximal subsequence length we can form from a starting index? Actually, we can precompute an array `max_length[i]` = the maximal length of a subsequence we can get starting at index i? But note: we don't care about the maximal, we care about the existence of a subsequence of a fixed length.

        We can precompute a table `last_occurrence` for the entire string? Actually, we can precompute:

            `dp[i]` = an array of 26 integers: the next occurrence of each character from index i.

        We can precompute this by scanning backwards:

            next_occurrence[i] = array of 26 integers (for 'A' to 'Z').

            We initialize next_occurrence[n] = infinity for all.
            Then for i from n-1 down to 0:
                next_occurrence[i] = a copy of next_occurrence[i+1]
                next_occurrence[i][S[i]-'A'] = i

        Then we can quickly get the next occurrence of a character c from i: next_occurrence[i][c].

        Then to check if we can form a subsequence of length L from index i:

            We can simulate: 
                current = i
                for j in range(L):
                    c = ?   We don't know the characters? But we want to know if there is ANY subsequence of length L? Actually, we want the minimal lexicographic one? But we don't need to know the entire sequence to check existence? Actually, we can check existence by:

                        We can use the greedy algorithm: take the smallest letter available? Actually, no: we want to know if there is any subsequence of length L starting at i? We can do:

                            The minimal next occurrence we can take for the next character is the minimal next_occurrence[i][c] for c in 'A'..'Z'. But then we can take that character and then the next from that index+1? Actually, we can do a greedy for the entire subsequence? But that would be O(26*L) and we are back to the same.

        Alternatively, we can precompute the maximal subsequence length we can get from i? 

            Let `max_suf[i]` = the maximal distinct subsequence length available from i? But that is not helpful.

        We can use a DP: `dp[i][j]` = the minimal last index we can achieve for a subsequence of length j starting from i? But j up to 200? Then we can do:

            dp[i][0] = i-1   (base: we take 0 characters, then we are at i-1? not exactly)

            Actually, we want to know the minimal total span? We want to know: starting from i, can we form a subsequence of length j? 

            We can do:

                dp[i][j] = min_{c in 'A'..'Z'} { dp[ next_occurrence[i][c] + 1 ][j-1] }

            But we don't care about the minimal span, we care about existence? Actually, we can set:

                dp[i][j] = a minimal index such that we can form a subsequence of length j starting from i? We can do:

                    dp[i][1] = next_occurrence[i][*] = we take the smallest next_occurrence[i][c] over c? Actually, not: we want to know the minimal last index for a subsequence of length j? 

            Actually, we want to know: what is the minimal last index of the first character we can choose? But then we can use:

                last = i-1
                for j in range(L):
                    last = next_occurrence[last+1][c]   for some c? 

            Alternatively, we can precompute `f[i][j]` = the minimal index >= i such that we can form a subsequence of length j? 

            We can compute backwards:

                f[i][j] = min_{c} { f[ next_occurrence[i][c] + 1 ][j-1] }

            But we want to know: is there a subsequence of length L starting at i? We can have:

                f[i][1] = min_{c} { next_occurrence[i][c] }
                f[i][j] = min_{c} { f[ next_occurrence[i][c] + 1 ][j-1] }

            Then we can check: if f[i][L] <= n, then yes.

            The state: i in [0, n], j in [0, K] (K<=200). Total states: n * K = 200000 * 200 = 40e6 per country? Then 1000 * 40e6 = 40e9 states? Not acceptable.

 Given the complexity, we decide to hope that the greedy_suffix is fast in practice because the country names are not worst-case? Or we try to optimize by checking without building the suffix if possible? 

    In `next_code_helper`, when we consider a candidate letter for position i, we can first check: after choosing this letter at an occurrence at index p, can we complete the subsequence of length (K-i-1) starting from p+1? 

        How to check quickly? We can use a precomputed array for the country: `suf[i]` = the maximal length of a greedy (smallest lexicographical) subsequence that can be formed starting at index i? But that is not the same as the existence.

        Alternatively, we can precompute for each country an array `min_chars_remaining[i]` = the number of distinct subsequences? Not helpful.

        We can precompute a table `can_form[i][j]` = whether we can form a subsequence of length j from index i? But then we don't care about lex order, just existence.

        How to compute `can_form[i][j]` quickly? 

            We can do:

                can_form[i][0] = True
                can_form[i][j] = OR_{c} can_form[ next_occurrence[i][c] + 1 ][j-1]

            But we want to do it for j up to 200 and i from 0 to n.

            The recurrence: 
                can_form[i][j] = exists a c such that there is an occurrence of c at some index p in [i, n-1] and can_form[p+1][j-1] is true.

            We can precompute this by iterating i backwards and for j from 1 to K.

            The state: O(n*K) = 200000 * 200 = 40e6 per country? Then 1000 * 40e6 = 40e9, which is too high.

 Given the time constraints, we decide to use the original greedy_suffix and hope that the test cases are not worst-case. Or we try to optimize by not calling greedy_suffix if we can quickly check that there are enough characters left? 

        We can compute the number of distinct letters in the suffix? But that doesn't help.

        Alternatively, we can use a simple check: the number of characters from index start to the end is at least the length we need? But that is not sufficient: we might have duplicates.

        We can precompute an array `next_index` for the entire country name: the next occurrence of any letter? Actually, we can compute an array `next_occurrence` for the entire country name for all letters in one array: 

            next_occurrence[i] = for each letter, the next occurrence from i.

        Then we can do a function `can_form(start, length)`:

            if length==0: return True
            current = start
            for j in range(length):
                # Find the earliest occurrence of any letter from current to the end: min_{c} next_occurrence[current][c]
                min_next = a big number
                for c in range(26):
                    if next_occurrence[current][c] < min_next:
                        min_next = next_occurrence[current][c]
                if min_next > n-1) # or out of bounds
                    return False
                current = min_next + 1

            return current <= n   # and we have taken length steps.

        But this is the greedy for the smallest letter at each step, and it yields the earliest next position. This is exactly the greedy_suffix without building the string, only checking the feasibility? And it's O(26*length) per call.

        Then we can use this to filter out candidate letters: before calling the full greedy_suffix (which builds the string), we check can_form(found_index+1, K-i-1). This might avoid the expensive greedy_suffix in some cases, but in the worst-case we still do the same work.

        The only advantage is that we might fail early in the can_form, but the greedy_suffix would fail at the same step.

    Given the complexity and constraints, we might need to live with the hope that the average-case is good.

    Or we can try to precompute for each country the entire `next_occurrence` table for the whole string for the 26 letters (which is O(26*n)) per country? 

        The memory: 26 * n per country. For one country with n=200000, that is 26*200000 = 5,200,000 integers per country. For 1000 countries: 5,200,000 * 1000 = 5.2e9 integers = 20.8 GB? Not acceptable.

    Therefore, we decide to implement the greedy_suffix with the pos_map and binary search, and hope that the test cases are not worst-case.

    Alternatively, we can build the `next_occurrence` for each country not for the whole string, but for the specific lists we have in the pos_map? We already have the pos_map. The function greedy_suffix is already using binary search per letter.

    So we leave the functions as described.

    Summary of implementation:

        Precomputation for each country: pos_map (dictionary of sorted lists of indices for each letter)

        Functions:

          // In C++, we will use map<char, vector<int>> for each country.

          function greedy_suffix(S, start, length, pos_map, n) -> string:
              if length==0: return ""
              string res;
              int current = start;
              for j=0 to length-1:
                  int R_bound = n - (length - j - 1);
                  char found_char = 0;
                  int found_index = -1;
                  for c='A' to 'Z':
                      if (pos_map.find(c) == pos_map.end()) continue;
                      vector<int>& arr = pos_map[c];
                      // binary search for the first index >= current
                      auto it = lower_bound(arr.begin(), arr.end(), current);
                      if (it != arr.end() && *it <= R_bound) {
                          found_char = c;
                          found_index = *it;
                          break;
                      }
                  }
                  if (found_char == 0) return ""; // fail
                  res.push_back(found_char);
                  current = found_index + 1;
              return res;

          function find_code_geq(S, prev, K, pos_map) -> string:
              int n = S.length();
              if (n < K) return "";
              if (S[0] < prev[0]) return "";
              string res = "";
              res += S[0];
              int current_index = 0;
              bool bound = (S[0] == prev[0]);

        Main:
          Read input.
          Build for each country name: a map<char, vector<int>> that is the sorted list of indices.

          Create a vector of pairs: (country_name, original_index) and sort by country_name.

          string prev_code = "";
          vector<string> codes(N); // for the original index

          for each country in the sorted list:
             if first country:
                 string bound0 = string(1, country_name[0]) + string(K-1, 'A');
                 string code = find_code_geq(country_name, bound0, K, pos_map[country_name]);
                 if (code == ""): print "NO", return.

                 // But note: we want the lexicographically smallest code, so bound0 is set to the minimal.
                 // However, if the country has a name that starts with 'A', then bound0 is "A...A", and find_code_geq will return the smallest code that is >= "A...A", which is the lex smallest.

             else:
                 string candidate = find_code_geq(country_name, prev_code, K, pos_map[country_name]);
                 if (candidate == "") {
                     print "NO", return.
                 }
                 if (candidate > prev_code) {
                     // use candidate
                 } else {
                     candidate = next_code_helper(country_name, prev_code, K, pos_map[country_name]);
                     if (candidate == "") {
                         print "NO", return.
                     }
                 }
                 then set prev_code = candidate, and assign to the original index.

          Then output "YES" and then the codes in the original order.

 13. However, note: the bound0 might not be achievable. The function find_code_geq will return the lex smallest code that is >= bound0. That is the minimal code.

 14. But wait: what if the minimal code is < bound0? 
        For example, if the country name is "AAB", K=2, then bound0 = "AA", but the minimal code is "AA" (which is achievable) and that's >= bound0.

        Or if the country name is "AB", K=2, then bound0 = "AA", but the minimal code is "AB", which is > "AA", and we return "AB", which is the minimal.

        So it works.

 15. One more issue: the first character of bound0 is the country's first character, and the function checks that.

 16. We must be cautious: the country name might contain lowercase? No, only uppercase.

                    string candidate = find_code_geq(name, prev_code, K, pm);
                    if (candidate == "") {
                        cout << "NO" << endl;
                        return 0;
                    }
                    if (candidate > prev_code) {
                        ans[orig_index] = candidate;
                        prev_code = candidate;
                    } else {
                        // candidate == prev_code, so we need strictly greater
                        candidate = next_code_helper(name, prev_code, K, pm);
                        if (candidate == "") {
                            cout << "NO" << endl;
                            return 0;
                        }
                        ans[orig_index] = candidate;
                        prev_code = candidate;
                    }
                }
            }

            cout << "YES" << endl;
            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
                cout << ans[i] << endl;
            }

            return 0;
        }

 17. Note: We built the pos_maps for the original country name by the index in the input. But when we are processing a country in sorted_countries, we use the original index to get the precomputed pos_map.

 18. Test with the sample: 
        Input: 
            2 2
            INDIA
            INDONESIA

        For the first country (in sorted order) is "INDIA", 
            bound0 = "IA" (because K=2, so first char 'I' and then one 'A')
            find_code_geq for "INDIA", with prev="IA": 
                first char: 'I' == 'I', so bound=true.
                j=1: we need a char >= 'A'. We try from 'A' to 'Z'. 
                    For 'A': in "INDIA", the positions of 'A': [4] -> L=1, R= 5-1 = 4? Actually, n=5, R = 5 - (2-1-1) = 5 - 0 = 5? -> but we need to leave 0 characters after? 
                    Actually, we are at the last character? So we need one character in the range [1, 5-0] = [1,5]. The 'A' at index4 is in [1,5]. So we choose 'A'. 
                Then code = "IA". 

            Then we assign "IA" to INDIA? But the sample output is "ID" and "IN". 

        Why? Because the sample output says:
            YES
            ID
            IN

        But note: the problem says: "If there are more than one possible country codes assignment, you may output any of them."

        However, the first country is "INDIA", and the minimal code is "IA". But the next country "INDONESIA": 
            candidate = find_code_geq("INDONESIA", "IA", 2, ...)
                first char: 'I' -> bound: 'I'=='I' -> bound=true.
                j=1: need a char >= 'A'. The smallest available is 'A'? But does "INDONESIA" have an 'A'? yes, at index7. 
                Then candidate = "IA", which is the same as the previous code. Then we call next_code_helper for "INDONESIA", with prev="IA".

            In next_code_helper:
                occ: for "IA": 
                    'I': the first occurrence in "INDONESIA" is at index0.
                    'A': next occurrence after0: at index7? 
                Then we try i=1 (last character): 
                    L_bound = occ[0]+1 = 0+1 = 1, R_bound = 9 - (2-1-1) = 9? 
                    We try to change the last character to a letter > 'A'. Try 'B','C', ... but none in the string? Then try 'D': 
                         'D' in "INDONESIA" at index2 -> which is in [1,9]. 
                    Then we form the suffix of length 0? so suffix = "".
                    Then new_code = "I" + "D" = "ID". 
                Then assign "ID" for INDONESIA? 

            But then we have:
                INDIA: "IA"
                INDONESIA: "ID"

            And lexicographically: "IA" < "ID", which is good.

            However, the sample expected: 
                INDIA: "ID"
                INDONESIA: "IN"

            Why did we not get that? 

            Because the problem says: we may output any valid assignment.

            But note: the sample input says:
                2 2
                INDIA
                INDONESIA

            Our sorted_countries: 
                "INDIA", "INDONESIA" -> sorted: "INDIA" comes before "INDONESIA".

            And our assignment: 
                INDIA: "IA"
                INDONESIA: "ID"

            But the sample output is:
                YES
                ID
                IN

            Why is that valid? 
                Condition: 
                  For INDIA: "ID" is a subsequence? I at0, D at2 -> yes.
                  For INDONESIA: "IN" is a subsequence? I at0, N at1 -> yes.
                And lex order: "INDIA" < "INDONESIA" and "ID" < "IN" -> valid.

            But our assignment is also valid.

            Why did we get "IA" for the first? Because we set the bound to "IA", and then found "IA" as the smallest.

            But the problem does not require the minimal code for the first country? It says we can output any.

            However, the sample input 2 2 ... and the sample output is fixed? The problem says "you may output any".

            But note: the next country: we have to assign a code that is > "IA". We assigned "ID", which is > "IA".

            So our solution is valid.

        But the problem sample output is different. We can adjust the bound0 for the first country to be the first character and then the smallest possible letter that is not necessarily 'A'. But the function find_code_geq will return the smallest code that is >= bound0. 

        How to get "ID" for the first country? 
            We set bound0 = "IA" -> then the function returns "IA". 
            If we set bound0 = "ID", then the function for INDIA: 
                first char: 'I' matches.
                j=1: bound=true -> we require >= 'D'. 
                    In INDIA: the letters available at indices>=1: 'N','D','I','A'. The smallest letter >= 'D' is 'D' (at index2). 
                Then we get "ID".

            Then for the next country: 
                candidate = find_code_geq("INDONESIA", "ID", 2, ...) 
                    first char: 'I' matches -> bound=true.
                    j=1: need >= 'D'. The smallest letter >= 'D' is 'D'? but wait, we want the lex smallest code that is >= "ID", so we try 'D','E',... until we find one that works? 
                    But we break at the first available: in "INDONESIA", the letters available from index1: 'N','D','O',... -> the smallest letter is 'D'. 
                    Then candidate = "ID", which is equal to the previous. 
                Then we call next_code_helper: 
                    occ for "ID": 
                        'I': index0
                        'D': index2
                    Then try to change the last character: 
                        i=1: L_bound = 0+1 = 1, R_bound=9-0=9.
                        try letters from 'E' to 'Z': then 'N' is available at index1 -> which is in [1,9]. 
                        Then suffix = "" -> so new_code = "IN"
                Then assign "IN".

            This matches the sample.

        How to achieve that? 
            We set the bound0 for the first country to be the first character and then (K-1) times the letter 'A'? 
            But if we want a specific assignment, we can set a different bound? 

            The problem: we want the lexicographically smallest code that is at least bound0. But the lexicographically smallest code might not be the one we want for the entire assignment? 

            However, the problem says: we can output any valid assignment. So we are allowed to choose any code for the first country as long as it is the lexicographically smallest? Not necessarily: we only require that the entire assignment has the property that the codes are in the same order as the country names. 

            Why did we choose the minimal code for the first country? 
                Because we set bound0 = first_char + (K-1)*'A'. Then we get the minimal code.

            But the minimal code might force the next country to be a code that is not available? 

            However, the problem does not require that we choose the minimal code. We can choose any code for the first country as long as there exists a valid assignment. 

            How to choose a code that allows the entire assignment to be valid? 
                We don't know. The editorial says: assign the lexicographically smallest valid code to the first country. 

            But the sample shows that we could have chosen "ID" for the first country and then "IN" for the next.

            How can we achieve that? 
                We can set the bound0 for the first country to "ID" instead of "I"+"A". 

            But then the function find_code_geq for the first country will return "ID" (if available) or a code >= "ID", which might be "ID" or greater.

            But what if we set bound0 for the first country to be the first character and then (K-1) times 'Z'? Then we might get the maximal code? 

            The problem: we must output any assignment. We don't require minimal. 

            However, the algorithm we have now is:

                first country: bound0 = first_char + (K-1)*'A'
                then the minimal code.

            This might lead to a failure later? For example, the sample: 
                first country: INDIA -> "IA", then next country: "ID", which is valid.

            But the sample input 2 2 also works with the sample output if we change the bound0 for the first country to "ID". 

            How to decide? 

            We want to maximize the chance of success. Using the minimal code for the first country leaves the most room for the next countries? 

            But in the sample, using "IA" for the first country and then "ID" for the next works, and using "ID" for the first and then "IN" for the next also works.

            However, if we use a minimal code for the first country, the next country might be forced to use a code that is the same as the first (if the next country name is the same as the first?) but the names are distinct. 

            And then we call next_code_helper to increase it.

            But the problem: next_code_helper might be expensive? 

            We can try to set the bound0 to be the previous country's code? But for the first country there is no previous.

            Alternatively, we can set the bound0 for the first country to be the first character and then (K-1) times the smallest letter that appears in the country name? But that might not be 'A'. 

            But we want the lex smallest code, so we want to use the smallest letters.

            Given the time, we leave it as bound0 = first_char + (K-1)*'A'. 

            But note: the sample input 2 2 works.

        Another sample: 
            Input:
                3 2
                IBAA
                IAAA
                IAAC

            The sample output: "NO"

            Why? 
                Sorted: 
                    IAAA, IAAC, IBAA

                First country: IAAA -> bound0 = "IA" -> 
                    find_code_geq: 
                        first char: 'I'
                        j=1: bound=true -> need >= 'A'. The smallest available in "IAAA" is 'A' at index1 -> code = "IA"

                Second country: IAAC -> 
                    candidate = find_code_geq("IAAC", "IA", 2, ...) 
                        first char: 'I' -> bound=true.
                        j=1: need >= 'A'. The smallest available is 'A' at index1 -> candidate = "IA", which is equal to prev.
                    then call next_code_helper for "IAAC", with "IA":
                        occ: 
                            'I': index0
                            'A': index1
                        try change at i=1: 
                            L_bound = index0+1 = 1
                            R_bound = 4 - 0 = 4
                            try letters from 'B' to 'Z': 
                                'A' is not tried because we start from 'B'. 
                                'C' is at index3 -> then suffix = "" (since K-i-1=0) -> new_code = "IC"
                        then assign "IC"

                Third country: IBAA -> 
                    candidate = find_code_geq("IBAA", "IC", 2, ...)
                        first char: 'I' -> bound=true: so we require the next char >= 'C'. 
                        In "IBAA": the letters available from index1: 'B','A','A'. The smallest letter >= 'C'? None. -> candidate = "" -> "NO"

            So we output "NO", which matches.

        Therefore, the code is as below.

 19. Note: the bound0 for the first country: if K==1, then bound0 = first_char (and then no 'A' appended). So we do:

            string bound0 = string(1, name[0]);
            if (K-1 > 0) {
                bound0 += string(K-1, 'A');
            }

        But we can simply: 
            string bound0 = string(1, name[0]) + string(K-1, 'A');

        If K==1, then we are adding 0 times 'A' -> it's just the first character.

 20. We note: the constraints on K: K>=1.

 21. Let's code accordingly.

 22. However, note: the sample input might have country names with length < K? We check in find_code_geq: if n<K, return "". Then we output "NO".

 23. We assume the input country names have length>=1, but might be less than K? Then we return "" and then "NO".

 24. We write the code accordingly.

 25. We hope it passes.

 26. One more thing: the next_code_helper might be expensive? But worst-case we hope the test cases are not adversarial.

 27. We run the sample: 
        Input: 
            2 2
            INDIA
            INDONESIA

        With bound0 = "IA" for the first country -> we get "IA" for INDIA, then for INDONESIA we get "ID" (by next_code_helper).

        Or if we change the bound0 for the first country to "ID", we get "ID" for INDIA and then "IN" for INDONESIA.

        How to set bound0 for the first country to "ID"? 

            We cannot, because we don't know the future. But the problem does not require a particular assignment.

        We choose to use bound0 = first_char + (K-1)*'A'

 28. Code accordingly.

 29. But note: the sample input 3 2: we return "NO", as expected.

 30. We run the code on the sample inputs.

 Let me do the first sample with bound0 = "IA" for INDIA:

        First country: "INDIA", bound0="IA"
          find_code_geq: 
            j0: 'I' (matches the first of bound0) -> bound=true.
            j1: we need a char >= 'A'. The available letters from index1: 
                We can pick any letter from index1 to index4 (because we need to leave 0 characters after the second character? Actually, for j=1 (the second character, index1 in the code) we require:
                  L = 0+1 = 1
                  R = 5 - (2-1-1) = 5 - 0 = 5? -> actually, we need to leave (K-1-1) = 0 characters after the second character? 
                  So the second character must be at an index <= n-1? Actually, R = n - (K - j - 1) = 5 - (2-1-1) = 5 - 0 = 5? But the string has indices [0,4]. So R should be n-1? 

        Correction: 
            We have already chosen the first character at index0. We need to choose the next character at an index > index0 and such that we can have K-1-1 = 0 characters after it? Then we can pick any index from 1 to 4 (because we don't need any after). So R = 4? 

            How do we compute R? 
                We require that after picking the j-th character at index p, we have (K - j - 1) characters to pick from the remaining string (from p+1 to the end). 
                So the remaining string must have at least (K - j - 1) characters? The length of the remaining string (from p+1 to the end) must be >= (K - j - 1). 
                The length of the remaining string is n - (p+1). 
                So we require: n - (p+1) >= (K - j - 1)  =>  p <= n - (K - j - 1) - 1? 
                Actually, the number of available indices after p is n - p - 1, and we need at least (K - j - 1) characters? Then we require n - p - 1 >= (K - j - 1) -> p <= n - (K - j) - 1? 

            Alternatively, we can set:
                R = n - (K - j - 1) - 1? 

            But note: we are going to pick one character at p, and then we need (K - j - 1) characters from p+1 to the end. 
                The last character we pick must be at most n-1, so the first character of the remaining part must be at p+1, and the last character we pick for the suffix must be at most n-1. 
                The suffix part must be of length (K-j-1). The earliest we can finish the suffix is if we pick the next K-j-1 characters at the next consecutive indices? But we don't require consecutive, so the minimal last index we need is p+1 + (K-j-1) - 1 = p + (K-j-1) 
                And we require: p + (K-j-1) <= n-1  => p <= n-1 - (K-j-1) = n - (K - j)

            So R = n - (K - j)

            Therefore, in the code: 
                R = n - (K - j)   [for the j-th character, 0-indexed j]

            For the first country, j=1 (the second character), then R = 5 - (2-1) = 5-1 = 4.

            Then for "INDIA": 
                For j=1: we require an occurrence in [1,4] of a letter >= 'A'. The first letter we try is 'A'? but we also have 'N','D','I'. 
                The smallest letter is 'A', but the occurrence of 'A' is at index4, which is in [1,4]. So we pick 'A'.

            Then code = "IA".

        Then for the next country, "INDONESIA": 
            candidate = find_code_geq( ... with prev="IA", ...)
                j0: 'I' -> bound=true.
                j1: we require a letter >= 'A'. The smallest letter in the available range [1, 9-?] -> n=9, j=1: R=9-(2-1)=8. The available letters: at index1: 'N', index2:'D', ... 
                The smallest letter >= 'A' is 'D' (if we consider the letter itself) but actually we iterate from 'A' to 'Z'. We try 'A': is there an 'A' in [1,8]? yes, at index7. Then we pick 'A', so candidate = "IA", which equals the previous.

            Then we call next_code_helper: 
                occ: for "IA": 
                    'I': index0
                    'A': index7
                Then we try to change the last character: 
                    i=1: L_bound = 0+1=1, R_bound = 9 - (2-1) = 8.
                    We try letters from 'B' to 'Z': 
                        'D' is in the string at index2 -> then suffix = "" -> new_code = "ID"

            Then we assign "ID".

        So the output for the first country is "IA", and the second is "ID".

        But the sample expected output is:
            YES
            ID
            IN

        However, the problem says: you may output any valid assignment.

        And our assignment is:
            INDIA: "IA"
            INDONESIA: "ID"

        And lex order: "IA" < "ID", and the country names: "INDIA" < "INDONESIA", so it's valid.

        Therefore, we output:

            YES
            IA
            ID

        But the sample output is:

            YES
            ID
            IN

        The problem does not require a particular assignment.

        However, the sample input order is:

            INDIA
            INDONESIA

        And we output:

            IA   for the first input country? 
            ID   for the second input country?

        But the problem: the output order must be: the i-th line is the country code of the i-th input country.

        In our code: 
            We stored the countries in sorted_countries: 
                sorted_countries[0] = ("INDIA", 0)
                sorted_countries[1] = ("INDONESIA", 1)

            Then we assign:
                ans[0] = "IA"
                ans[1] = "ID"

            Then we output:
                YES
                IA   (for the first input country, which is INDIA)
                ID   (for the second input country, which is INDONESIA)

        So the output:

            YES
            IA
            ID

        But the sample expected:

            YES
            ID
            IN

        They output the code for the first input country (INDIA) as "ID", and the second (INDONESIA) as "IN".

        Why the difference? 

            The sample input:

                2 2
                INDIA
                INDONESIA

            The sorted list by name: 
                "INDIA" and "INDONESIA": 
                    "INDIA" < "INDONESIA" because at the third character: 'D' vs 'D', then fourth character: 'I' vs 'O'? Actually, compare:

                        I N D I A
                        I N D O N ... -> so at the fourth character: 'I' vs 'O', so "INDIA" is less.

            So sorted_countries[0] = "INDIA", sorted_countries[1] = "INDONESIA".

            Then we assign the first in sorted order to "IA", and the second to "ID".

            Then we output the codes in the original order: 
                The first input country is INDIA -> we output ans[0] = "IA"
                The second input country is INDONESIA -> we output ans[1] = "ID"

            So the output:

                YES
                IA
                ID

            But the sample expected output is:

                YES
                ID
                IN

            which corresponds to:

                INDIA: "ID"
                INDONESIA: "IN"

            Why did they output "ID" for INDIA and "IN" for INDONESIA?

            It is because they are outputting in the input order? The sample input order is:

                first country: INDIA
                second country: INDONESIA

            And the sample output:

                first: ID
                second: IN

            Our assignment for the original index of INDIA (which is the first input) is stored in ans[0] = "IA", and for the second input ans[1] = "ID".

            But the problem: the i-th output line is the country code of the i-th input country.

            Our sorted_countries does not break the input order? We do:

                sorted_countries[i] = (country_names[i], i)

            Then after sorting, we process in sorted order, and we assign:

                ans[orig_index] = code

            Then when we output, we output ans[0] for the first input country, ans[1] for the second, etc.

            So it is correct.

        Therefore, our output is:

            YES
            IA
            ID

        for the sample.

        But the problem says the sample output is:

            YES
            ID
            IN

        And they are also valid. 

        We can adjust to get the sample output by setting a different bound for the first country? 
            If we set the bound0 for the first country to "ID", then we get:

                First country: "INDIA": 
                    find_code_geq("INDIA", "ID", 2, ...) 
                        j0: 'I' -> bound=true.
                        j1: need >= 'D'. The available letters: 'N' (at1) is not >= 'D'? it is, but we break at the first available. 
                            We try 'D' to 'Z': the smallest letter >= 'D' is 'D'? and it is at index2. 
                        Then code = "ID"

                Second country: "INDONESIA": 
                    candidate = find_code_geq("INDONESIA", "ID", 2, ...)
                        j0: 'I' -> bound=true.
                        j1: need >= 'D'. The smallest letter available is 'D'? at index2 -> candidate = "ID", which equals the previous.
                    then next_code_helper: 
                        occ: for "ID": 
                            'I':0, 'D':2
                        try to change the last character: 
                            i=1: L_bound=1, R_bound=9- (2-1)=8.
                            try letters from 'E' to 'Z': the first available is 'N' (at index1? note: we start at L_bound=1, and 'N' is at index1 -> which is in [1,8]. 
                            Then new_code = "I" + "N" = "IN", and suffix length=0.
                    assign "IN"

            Then we output:

                ans[0] = "ID"   (for the first input country, which is INDIA)
                ans[1] = "IN"   (for the second input country, which is INDONESIA)

            That matches the sample.

        How to set bound0 for the first country to "ID"? 
            We would need to know that the next country is "INDONESIA" and that we will need a code greater than "ID", so we assign "ID" to the first.

        But we don't know the future.

        However, the problem says: we may output any valid assignment.

        But our current method for the first country uses the minimal code. 

        How about we try to set the bound0 to the first character and then (K-1) times the letter 'A', and then if the next country requires a code greater than the minimal code, we use next_code_helper for the first country? 

            No, because the first country has no previous.

        Alternatively, we can process the countries in sorted order and try to assign codes that are as small as possible but not smaller than the previous, and if we find that the next country might have a problem, we backtrack? 

        That would be expensive.

        Given the complexity, we decide to change the bound0 for the first country to be the first character and then (K-1) times the letter 'A', and then hope that the entire assignment works.

        But the sample output we provided for the first sample is valid.

        Therefore, we leave the code as is.

 31. Final code in C++.

 32. Note: the function next_code_helper might be slow in worst-case, but the problem constraints say the total length of all country names is 200,000, and K up to 200, and N up to 1000. We hope the greedy_suffix and the next_code_helper are not called too many times and the inner loops break early.

 Let's hope.

 We write the code accordingly.
