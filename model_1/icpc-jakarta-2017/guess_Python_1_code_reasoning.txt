 Okay, let's break down the problem and the editorial guidelines.

 We are given:
   N, K: the range [1, N] and maximum number of guesses K.
   A string s of answers (each character is one of '<', '>', '=').

 Conditions on the string:
   - If there's an '=', it must be the last character and all previous characters are '<' or '>'.
   - Otherwise, the string has exactly K characters and each is '<' or '>'.

 We need to output a sequence of guesses (each an integer in [1, N]) such that:
   - The guesses are consistent with the given answers and Theodora's cheating strategy.

 Theodora's strategy:
   When Romanos guesses g, Theodora will choose between:
      <: meaning the number is in [L, g-1]
      >: meaning the number is in [g+1, R]
   and she chooses the answer that leaves the larger interval. In case of tie, she chooses '<'.

 How to simulate?

 Steps from editorial:

 1. Precompute an array `min_size` for each position i (from 0 to M-1, where M = len(s)):
      min_size[i] = the minimal size of the interval required at step i to be able to complete the remaining answers.

    We traverse backwards:
      Let M = len(s)
      min_size[M] = 0   [after the last answer, no more moves, so 0 needed? Actually, at the last step we must have at least 1 for '=' or at least 2 for non-last?]

    Actually, according to the editorial:

      - If at position i we have an '=' (which must be the last), then min_size[i] = 1.
      - For the last character (if it is not '=') then we have a non-last step: at the last step (i = M-1) we require min_size[M-1] = 2 (because then we have two possibilities: if the guess is g, then we need at least one number below and one above? Actually, no: for a non-last step at the last answer we don't need two? Let me read the editorial again: for the last position (if it is the last step and we have '<' or '>') then min_size[i] = 2? Actually, the editorial says: for the last position (i=M-1) and if it is not the final '=', then we set min_size[M-1] = 2? But note: the game ends after K guesses. However, in the string we have exactly M answers.

    Actually, the editorial:

      - For "=" at position i (which must be the last), set min_size[i] = 1.
      - For "<" or ">" at the last position (i=M-1) [meaning that the entire string has M = K, and we have no '='?], set min_size[i] = 2.
      - For other positions (i not the last) and the answer is '<' or '>', then min_size[i] = min_size[i+1] + 1? 

    But wait: if we have an answer at step i (say '<') then the interval becomes [L, g-1]. Then we need to be able to complete the remaining answers with the interval [L, g-1]. How many numbers do we need at step i? 

    Actually, the minimal size required at step i is:
        If at step i we have '=', then we must have exactly one number -> min_size[i] = 1.
        If at step i we have '<' or '>', then we split the interval. Theodora's answer will leave one of two intervals. We must be able to cover the remaining steps with the chosen interval. However, Theodora chooses the interval that is larger, so we must consider that the next state must be the worst-case? Actually, no: we know the entire future answers. We know the exact sequence. So the minimal size at step i must be at least the minimal size required at step i+1 plus one? Actually, no: because we are going to lose one number (the guess) and then the interval we end up with must be at least min_size[i+1]. But note: we have two possibilities: 
          - If we answer '<', the next interval is [L, g-1] and we require that the size of that interval is at least min_size[i+1].
          - Similarly for '>'.

        However, we don't know which one Theodora will choose? But wait: in the problem we are given the entire answer string. So we know the exact answer at step i. Therefore, we can define:

          Let min_size[i] = minimal interval size required at step i to be able to get through the rest of the answers.

          Then:
            If at step i the answer is '=': then min_size[i] = 1.
            Else (it is '<' or '>'):
                Then after this step, we have an interval of size (g-1 - L + 1) for '<', or (R - (g+1) + 1) for '>'. We require that the next state must have at least min_size[i+1]. Therefore, the interval after the guess must have at least min_size[i+1]. 

          How do we relate that to the current interval? 
          We are going to choose a guess g. After the guess and Theodora's answer (which we know), the interval becomes:
             for '<': [L, g-1] -> must have at least min_size[i+1] numbers => so we require: (g-1) - L + 1 >= min_size[i+1]  => g - L >= min_size[i+1].
             for '>': [g+1, R] -> must have at least min_size[i+1] numbers => R - g >= min_size[i+1].

          Additionally, we have the constraint that Theodora's choice must be the one that maximizes the remaining interval? Actually, we are given the answer, so we know which branch we are in. However, for the minimal size requirement at step i, we must also account for the fact that the guess g must be chosen such that the entire current interval is consistent. But note: the minimal size for the current step must be at least 1 (if it's the last and '=') or for a non-last step: we require that the current interval has at least min_size[i] = min_size[i+1] + 1? 

          Actually, the editorial says: for non-final positions (i.e., not the last) and for '<' or '>', we set min_size[i] = min_size[i+1] + 1. Why?
          Because: we are going to remove the guess and then the next interval must be of size at least min_size[i+1]. But we can also note that the minimal size at step i must be at least min_size[i+1] + 1: because we are going to have one guess and then the next state must have min_size[i+1]. However, that is not entirely accurate: the next state is a contiguous interval that must be non-empty and of at least min_size[i+1]. But we also have the condition that the guess must lie in the interval. Therefore, the minimal size is min_size[i+1] + 1? 

          Actually, consider: 
            Step i: we have an interval [L, R]. We choose g in [L, R]. Then if the answer is '<', the next interval is [L, g-1] and we require that (g-1 - L + 1) >= min_size[i+1] -> g - L >= min_size[i+1]. Similarly, if the answer is '>', then R - g >= min_size[i+1]. 

          However, the minimal size of the current interval must be at least min_size[i+1] + 1? Actually, the minimal current interval size is min_size[i+1] + 1? Because we need to have at least min_size[i+1] numbers in the next interval and one number for the guess? Not exactly: the guess is one number, and then the next interval must have min_size[i+1] numbers. But note: the next interval is adjacent to the guess. 

          Actually, the minimal current interval size is min_size[i+1] + 1? Why? Because if we require the next interval to have at least min_size[i+1] numbers, then the current interval must have at least min_size[i+1] + 1 numbers: the guess and the next interval. However, that is not the case: the next interval is entirely separate from the guess. For example, if the answer is '<', then the current interval must include at least min_size[i+1] numbers below the guess and the guess itself? Actually, no: the numbers below the guess must be at least min_size[i+1] and the guess is one more. So the entire interval must have at least min_size[i+1] + 1? 

          Therefore, we set:
            min_size[i] = min_size[i+1] + 1   for non-final step.

          But what if the next step is the last and is '='? Then min_size[i+1] = 1, so min_size[i] = 2. That makes sense: we need at least two numbers: one for the guess and one for the next step (which must be the correct number, so we need at least one number left).

          However, if the next step is not the last? Then we have min_size[i+1] = min_size[i+2] + 1, so min_size[i] = min_size[i+2] + 2.

          Actually, the recurrence is:

            min_size[i] = 
               if i == M-1 (last index) and s[i]=='=': 1
               else if i == M-1 and (s[i]=='<' or s[i]=='>'): 2
               else (i is not last): 
                    min_size[i] = min_size[i+1] + 1

          But wait: what if the current step is not the last and we have an answer that is '<' or '>'? Then we require the next interval to be at least min_size[i+1]. How do we express the minimal current interval? 
             We need at least min_size[i+1] in the next interval and the guess. However, the next interval is contiguous and does not include the guess. Therefore, the entire current interval must be at least min_size[i+1] + 1? Yes.

          However, note: if the current step is the last and we have an '=', then we only need 1.

          But what if the current step is the last and we have a '<'? Then we require that the interval has at least 2: because we must have the guess and at least one number below the guess? Actually, no: the guess is wrong, and then we require that there is at least one number below the guess? Then the current interval must be at least 2: one for the guess and one below? But the guess is one number, and the next state is the one number below? Actually, the next state doesn't require a next guess: the game ends after K guesses. However, the problem says: the game ends either by a correct guess or after K wrong guesses. So if we have a string of K '<' or '>' and no '=', then after K wrong guesses the game ends. But in the last step, we don't need to leave a non-empty interval? Actually, we do: because after the last wrong guess, the interval must be non-empty? But the problem doesn't require that. Actually, the game ends and Theodora wins. However, the problem states: Romanos loses only when all K guesses are wrong. But the number must be consistent with the answers. Therefore, after the last guess, the remaining interval must be non-empty? 

          However, the problem does not require that the remaining interval has exactly one number. It just must be consistent. Therefore, the minimal condition for the last step (without an '=') is that there must be at least one number that is consistent with the last answer? But note: if the last answer is '<', then the number must be less than the last guess. So we must have at least one number in the interval that is less than the last guess. Similarly for '>'. Therefore, the current interval (at the last step) must have at least 2 numbers? Actually, no: the current interval at the last step could be of size 1: but then if we guess that one number, we must have said '='? But we are not saying '='. So if the current interval at the last step has size 1, then we must guess that number and then Theodora must say '='. But the answer is not '='. So we cannot have an interval of size 1 at the last step if the answer is '<' or '>'. Therefore, we require at least 2 numbers at the last step for a non-'=' answer.

          Therefore, the recurrence for min_size[i] is:

            Let M = len(s)
            min_size[M] = 1   # after the last answer, we don't need any more numbers? Actually, we don't have any more steps. But we don't need to represent the state after the last answer? 

          Instead, we define for the state at step i (before we make the i-th guess) the minimal interval size required.

            For the last step (i = M-1):
                if s[M-1] == '=': then we need at least 1 (so min_size[M-1] = 1)
                else: we need at least 2 (min_size[M-1] = 2)

            For step i from M-2 down to 0:
                min_size[i] = min_size[i+1] + 1

          Why? Because at step i, we make a guess and then the next step requires min_size[i+1]. We need at least min_size[i+1] in the next interval and we are going to remove the guess. However, note that the next interval is only one part. But the current interval must contain the guess and the entire next interval? Actually, the next interval is a contiguous segment that is either to the left or to the right of the guess. Therefore, the entire current interval must have at least min_size[i+1] + 1 numbers? Yes.

          However, what if the next interval is the entire left part? Then the current interval must have the left part (min_size[i+1] numbers) and the guess and the right part? But the right part is not used. Actually, the next interval is only one contiguous segment. So the minimal current interval must be at least min_size[i+1] + 1? Yes: we have the numbers in the next interval (min_size[i+1]) and the guess (1 number) and possibly more. But note: the next interval is contiguous and adjacent to the guess. The minimal requirement is that the next interval has at least min_size[i+1] numbers, and the guess is one number. Therefore, the entire current interval must be at least min_size[i+1] + 1? 

          Actually, consider: 
            For step i: 
              If the answer is '<', then we require that the next interval [L, g-1] has at least min_size[i+1] numbers. Therefore, (g-1 - L + 1) >= min_size[i+1] -> (g - L) >= min_size[i+1]. The current interval includes [L, g] at least (which has size g-L+1) which is at least min_size[i+1] + 1.

          Similarly, for '>', the next interval is [g+1, R] and we require (R - g) >= min_size[i+1]. The current interval [g, R] has size R-g+1, which is at least min_size[i+1] + 1.

          Therefore, the recurrence min_size[i] = min_size[i+1] + 1 holds.

          But note: what if the answer at step i is '='? Then we don't have a next step? Actually, '=' only appears at the last step. So we don't consider non-last '='.

 2. Simulation:

    We maintain the current interval [L, R] (initially [1, N]).
    We traverse the string s from index 0 to M-1 (M = len(s)).

    For each step i with answer c = s[i]:

        Check: if R - L + 1 < min_size[i]: then output -1 and return.

        Then:
          if c == '=':
              Then the current interval must have exactly one number? Actually, the min_size[i] is 1. So we require L == R. 
              Then we guess L (or R) and we are done.

          else if c == '<':
              We have to choose a guess g such that:
                  - g is in [L, R]
                  - After Theodora answers '<', the next interval is [L, g-1] and must have at least min_size[i+1] numbers? 
                    -> (g-1 - L + 1) >= min_size[i+1]   -> g >= L + min_size[i+1]

              Additionally, Theodora's cheating strategy: 
                Theodora will choose the answer that leaves the largest interval. So if we guess g, then:
                  Option 1: '<' -> interval [L, g-1] of size (g - L)
                  Option 2: '>' -> interval [g+1, R] of size (R - g)

                But we are given that she answered '<'. Therefore, we must have: 
                  (g - L) >= (R - g)   [because if the two intervals are equal, she chooses '<'? which is the tie-breaker?]

                Actually, the problem says: "maximizes the possible answer range" and in tie chooses '<'. So we require:
                  (g - L) >= (R - g)   [because then she would choose '<'?] 
                However, note: we are given that she answered '<', so we must have that the interval for '<' is at least as large as the interval for '>'? And if they are equal, she chooses '<'? So we require:
                  (g - L) >= (R - g)

                Why? Because if (g - L) < (R - g), then she would have chosen '>' to leave the larger interval. But we got '<', so we must have (g - L) >= (R - g).

          Similarly, for '>':
              We require: 
                 g is in [L, R]
                 The next interval for '>' is [g+1, R] and must have at least min_size[i+1] numbers: (R - g) >= min_size[i+1] -> g <= R - min_size[i+1]

              And the cheating condition: 
                 The interval for '>' (R - g) must be at least as large as the interval for '<' (g - L). But note: in case of tie she would choose '<'? So if we got '>', then we must have:
                    (R - g) > (g - L)   [if equal, she would have chosen '<', so to get '>' we require (R - g) > (g - L)]

          However, wait: the problem says: "whenever possible, Theodora will always answer either ... that maximizes the possible answer range. In the case of tie, she will always answer the first one (<)."

          Therefore, for a guess g, Theodora will answer:
              '<' if (g - L) >= (R - g)
              '>' if (g - L) < (R - g)

          But note: if the current interval has even size? Then the two intervals might be equal? Then she answers '<'. 

          Therefore, to get an answer '<', we must have (g - L) >= (R - g). 
          To get an answer '>', we must have (g - L) < (R - g).

        So we have two constraints for the guess g.

        How to choose g? 

        Editorial suggests:

          For '<': 
            low_bound = max( ceil((L+R)/2), L + min_size[i+1] )
            Then we can choose g = low_bound? But note: we must also satisfy the condition that g is at least L and at most R, and the condition for the next interval.

          Actually, the condition for the next interval is g >= L + min_size[i+1] (because the next interval must be at least min_size[i+1] numbers). And the condition for Theodora to answer '<' is g >= ceil((L+R)/2) [because (g-L) >= (R-g) -> 2g >= L+R -> g >= ceil((L+R)/2)].

          Therefore, we set:
              g = max( ceil((L+R)/2), L + min_size[i+1] )

          But note: ceil((L+R)/2) might not be an integer? Actually, we are working with integers. We can compute:

              mid = (L+R) // 2   -> but if (L+R) is odd, then ceil((L+R)/2) = (L+R+1)//2.

          Alternatively, we can express: 
              Condition: g >= ceil((L+R)/2) -> g >= (L+R+1)//2   [for integers]

          However, we must also have g <= R.

          Therefore, if max( (L+R+1)//2, L + min_size[i+1] ) > R, then it's impossible -> output -1.

        Similarly, for '>':

            Condition: g <= R - min_size[i+1]   (from the next interval requirement) and 
                      g < (L+R)/2   [because (g-L) < (R-g) -> 2g < L+R -> g < (L+R)/2] -> but note: integers, so we can write g <= (L+R-1)//2? 

            Actually: 2g < L+R -> g <= floor((L+R-1)/2). 

            So set:
                g = min( (L+R-1)//2, R - min_size[i+1] )

            And we require g >= L.

          However, note: the condition for the next interval for '>' is (R - g) >= min_size[i+1] -> g <= R - min_size[i+1]. 

          And the condition for Theodora to answer '>' is g <= (L+R-1)//2.

          So we set g = min( (L+R-1)//2, R - min_size[i+1] ).

          But we also must have g >= L.

          If this value is less than L, then it's impossible.

        However, note: we must also consider that the guess must be an integer in [L, R]. 

        Steps:

          Let M = len(s)

          Precompute min_size[0..M] (array of length M, and min_size[M] is not used? Actually, for the last step, we have min_size[M-1]. For step i, we use min_size[i] for the current interval requirement and min_size[i+1] for the next interval requirement (if i is not the last).

          But if i is the last step (i = M-1) and c is '<' or '>', then we don't have min_size[i+1]? We defined min_size for indices 0 to M-1.

          How to handle the last step for '<' and '>'?

          For the last step (i = M-1) and c is '<' or '>':
             min_size[i] = 2 -> we have already checked that the current interval has at least 2.
             Then for the next interval? There is no next step. But the condition for the next interval? We don't have min_size[i+1] for i=M-1.

          Therefore, we need to adjust:

             For step i, if i is the last (i = M-1) and c is not '=', then for:
                 c == '<': we require that the next interval (which is not used in any future step) must be non-empty? Actually, the problem doesn't require a minimal size for the next state because there are no more guesses. But we require that the answer is consistent: if she says '<', then there must be at least one number less than g. Therefore, we require g-1 >= L -> g >= L+1. So the condition for the next interval is that the interval [L, g-1] is non-empty -> at least one number -> so we require g >= L+1.

                 Similarly, for '>', we require g <= R-1.

          Therefore, we can define:
            For step i (with answer c) and if it is the last step and c is not '=', then we set:
                next_min = 1   # because we only need one number in the next interval? Actually, the next interval must have at least one number.

          For non-last steps, next_min = min_size[i+1].

          But note: in the recurrence, we defined min_size[i] for the entire string. For the last step (non '='), we set min_size[i]=2. And then for the step i (last step) we require the next interval to be of size at least 1? which is consistent.

          However, in the recurrence we built min_size backwards, so:

            min_size[M-1] = 2   (for non '=' last step)
            min_size[i] = min_size[i+1] + 1 for i < M-1.

          Then for a step i that is not the last, we use min_size[i+1] as the next requirement. For the last step (i=M-1) and non '=', we don't use min_size[i+1]? So we can handle:

            if i == M-1 and c != '=':
                next_min = 1
            else: 
                next_min = min_size[i+1]   # for non-last steps and for last step with '=' we don't use next_min? Actually, for '=' we don't need next_min.

          Actually, for '=' we don't use next_min.

          Therefore:

            For step i:

              if c == '=':
                 if L != R: then it's impossible -> output -1 and return.
                 else: guess g = L (or R) and then break.

              elif c == '<':
                 if i == M-1: 
                    next_min = 1
                 else:
                    next_min = min_size[i+1]

                 # Condition: the next interval [L, g-1] must have at least next_min numbers -> g - L >= next_min -> g >= L + next_min
                 # and Theodora condition: g must be at least ceil((L+R)/2) -> g >= (L+R+1)//2

                 g = max( (L+R+1)//2, L + next_min )

                 if g > R:  # invalid
                    return -1

                 # Also, we must have the next interval non-empty? Actually, we have the condition g>=L+next_min which ensures the next interval has at least next_min (>=1) numbers.

                 Then update: R = g - 1   [because the answer is '<', so the number is in [L, g-1]]

              elif c == '>':
                 if i == M-1:
                    next_min = 1
                 else:
                    next_min = min_size[i+1]

                 # Condition: the next interval [g+1, R] must have at least next_min numbers -> R - g >= next_min -> g <= R - next_min
                 # Theodora condition: to get '>' we require (R - g) > (g - L) -> 2g < L+R -> g <= (L+R-1)//2   [because integer division: floor((L+R-1)/2) = (L+R-1)//2]

                 g = min( (L+R-1)//2, R - next_min )

                 if g < L: 
                    return -1

                 Then update: L = g + 1

          Then we output the guess g for this step.

        But note: what if the current interval is [1,1] and we have a non-last step? Then we cannot make a non-last step? We already checked by min_size: we require min_size[i] for step i, so if the current interval size is less than min_size[i], we output -1.

        Also, note: the min_size array is computed for each step i: the minimal interval size required at step i.

 3. Special case: the entire string ends with '='? Then the last character is '=' and we break.

 4. What if the string has less than K answers? Then we only output the guesses for the given answers.

 Implementation:

   Steps:

     M = len(s)

     Precompute min_size: array of length M (index 0 to M-1)

        min_size[M-1] = 1 if s[M-1]=='=' else 2

        for i from M-2 down to 0:
            min_size[i] = min_size[i+1] + 1

     Then:

        L = 1, R = N
        guesses = []

        for i in range(M):
            # Check current interval size: 
            if R - L + 1 < min_size[i]:
                print(-1)
                return

            c = s[i]

            if c == '=':
                # Must be last step? Actually, the problem says the last character is '='. So i must be M-1? But we are iterating until M-1, so we can have M-1 as the last.
                if i != M-1:
                    # But the problem states: the last character is '=' and the previous are '<' or '>'. So we assume the input is as described. However, if we get '=' not at the last, then it's invalid? Actually, the input condition says: the last character is '=' and the others are not. So we can assume that if we see '=', then i must be the last index? 
                    # But what if the string has an '=' in the middle? Then the problem says the last character must be '='? So if the string has an '=' at i and i is not the last, then it's an invalid input? Actually, the problem says: "The last character of the string is '=' and each character of the string other than the last character is either '<' or '>', and the length of the string is not more than K". So we can assume that if we have an '=' then i must be the last index.

                    # Therefore, if we get '=' at a non-last index, we should output -1? Or the input is valid? Actually, the input is given as described. So we assume that if we get '=' then i must be the last index.

                    # However, the problem says: the last character of the string is '='. So if we have a string of length M, then the last character is at index M-1. Therefore, we only see '=' when i==M-1.

                # So we can do:
                if L != R:
                    print(-1)
                    return
                guesses.append(L)   # or R, they are the same.
                # Then we break? But there might be more answers? Actually, the game ends when we get '='. But the string has exactly M answers? And we are at the last character? So we break.

            else: # c is '<' or '>'
                if i == M-1:
                    next_min = 1
                else:
                    next_min = min_size[i+1]

                if c == '<':
                    # Compute the minimal g for the next interval: g >= L+next_min
                    # and the Theodora condition: g >= ceil((L+R)/2) = (L+R+1)//2
                    g1 = (L+R+1) // 2
                    g2 = L + next_min
                    g = max(g1, g2)
                    if g > R:
                        print(-1)
                        return
                    # Then update: R = g - 1
                    guesses.append(g)
                    R = g - 1
                else: # c == '>'
                    g1 = (L+R-1) // 2   # because we require g <= (L+R-1)//2 to have (R-g) > (g-L) -> actually, the condition is strict? But note: if (g-L) == (R-g), then Theodora would choose '<'. So to get '>' we must have (R-g) > (g-L) -> g < (L+R)/2 -> so g <= (L+R-1)//2 (since integer)
                    g2 = R - next_min
                    g = min(g1, g2)
                    if g < L:
                        print(-1)
                        return
                    guesses.append(g)
                    L = g + 1

        Then output the guesses: as space separated integers.

 5. Corner: what if the min_size[0] is already > N? Then we output -1 at the first step.

 6. Example: Sample Input "10 5\n><>="

      N=10, K=5, s = "><>=" (M=4)

      Precompute min_size:
          min_size[3] = 1   (because last char '=')
          min_size[2] = min_size[3] + 1 = 2
          min_size[1] = min_size[2] + 1 = 3
          min_size[0] = min_size[1] + 1 = 4

      Now simulate:

        Step0: L=1, R=10, min_size[0]=4 -> current interval [1,10] (size 10>=4) -> ok.
                c = '>' -> so we are in the first character which is '>', and it's not the last? i=0 -> not last -> next_min = min_size[1]=3.

                For '>': 
                  g1 = (1+10-1)//2 = (10)//2 = 5
                  g2 = R - next_min = 10 - 3 = 7
                  g = min(5,7) = 5.

                So guess 5? But the sample output starts with 5? Then the answer is '>' -> so Theodora says '>', then the next interval becomes [6,10].

                Update: L = 5+1 = 6.

        Step1: [6,10], min_size[1]=3 -> size=5>=3 -> ok.
                c = '<' -> not last -> next_min = min_size[2]=2.

                For '<': 
                  g1 = (6+10+1)//2 = (17)//2 = 8
                  g2 = L + next_min = 6+2 = 8
                  g = max(8,8)=8.

                Guess 8 -> Theodora says '<', so next interval [6,7]

                Update: R = 8-1 = 7.

        Step2: [6,7], min_size[2]=2 -> size=2>=2 -> ok.
                c = '>' -> not last? Actually, i=2, and M=4 -> not last -> next_min = min_size[3]=1.

                For '>':
                  g1 = (6+7-1)//2 = (12)//2 = 6
                  g2 = R - next_min = 7-1 = 6
                  g = min(6,6)=6.

                Guess 6 -> Theodora says '>', so next interval [7,7]

                Update: L = 6+1 = 7.

        Step3: [7,7], min_size[3]=1 -> size=1>=1 -> ok.
                c = '=' -> then we guess 7.

                Output: [5,8,6,7] -> matches sample.

      Another sample: "10 5\n><<><"

        s = "><<><", M=5.

        Precompute min_size:
            min_size[4] = 2   (last char is not '=')
            min_size[3] = 2+1=3
            min_size[2] = 3+1=4
            min_size[1] = 4+1=5
            min_size[0] = 5+1=6

        Step0: [1,10] -> c='>' -> next_min = min_size[1]=5
                g1 = (1+10-1)//2 = 10//2 = 5
                g2 = 10 - 5 = 5
                g = min(5,5)=5 -> but wait: the sample output starts with 4? 

        Why? The sample output: 4 10 8 5 7.

        So first guess is 4? Then Theodora answers '>', meaning the number is greater than 4 -> so next interval [5,10]. 

        How do we get 4? 

        For step0: c is '>', so we need:

          Condition for Theodora to answer '>': (R-g) > (g-L) -> (10-g) > (g-1) -> 10 - g > g - 1 -> 11 > 2g -> g < 5.5 -> so g <= 5.

          Also, condition for the next interval: R - g >= next_min (5) -> 10 - g >= 5 -> g <= 5.

          Therefore, g must be at most 5 and at least 1? But also we have the Theodora condition g<=5.5 -> so g in [1,5].

          But we can choose any g in [1,5]? The sample chooses 4. How?

        The editorial says: we choose g = min( (L+R-1)//2, R - next_min ) -> that was 5.

        Why 4? 

        Actually, note: the condition for the next interval: R-g >= next_min -> g <= R - next_min = 10-5=5.

        And the Theodora condition: g <= (L+R-1)//2 = (1+10-1)//2 = 10//2=5.

        So the minimal g? We choose the minimal g that satisfies both? Actually, we choose the minimum of the two bounds? But the two bounds are 5 and 5? Then we get 5.

        However, we can choose any g in [L, min( (L+R-1)//2, R - next_min )]? 

        The editorial says: we set g = min( (L+R-1)//2, R - next_min ). 

        But the sample output has 4. How do we get 4? 

        Actually, the problem says: "you may output any of them". So we don't necessarily have to choose the minimal? 

        However, the editorial says:

          For '>': set g = min( (L+R-1)//2, R - next_min )

        So we choose the minimal possible g? But that would be 1? But we have the constraint: the Theodora condition requires g<=5, and the next interval condition also requires g<=5. But we can choose any g in [L, min( (L+R-1)//2, R - next_min )]? Actually, the expression min( (L+R-1)//2, R - next_min ) gives 5, so we can choose any g from 1 to 5? 

        But wait: the condition for Theodora to answer '>' is that (R-g) > (g-L) -> which is equivalent to g <= (L+R-1)//2. And we set g = min( (L+R-1)//2, R - next_min ). This sets g to 5? 

        However, if we choose g=4, then:
            Theodora condition: (10-4)=6 > (4-1)=3 -> true, so she answers '>'. 
            The next interval: [5,10] has size 6 >= next_min=5 -> valid.

        So why the editorial chooses the minimal of the two? Actually, we are free to choose any g that satisfies:

            g <= (L+R-1)//2   [to get the answer '>']
            g <= R - next_min   [to have the next interval large enough]

            and g>=L.

        Therefore, we can choose any g in [L, min( (L+R-1)//2, R - next_min )]? 

        Similarly, for '<', we choose any g in [max(ceil((L+R)/2), L+next_min), R]?

        But the problem says: "you may output any of them".

        Therefore, we can choose any value that satisfies the constraints. 

        However, the editorial suggests:

            For '<': g = max( ceil((L+R)/2), L+next_min )
            For '>': g = min( floor((L+R-1)/2), R - next_min )

        But note: if we choose a value that is not the bound, we might break the next steps? 

        Actually, we are only constrained by the two conditions. So we can choose any value in the valid range.

        But the sample output for the first step is 4. How do we get 4? 

        We can change the algorithm: for '>' we can choose any g in [L, min( (L+R-1)//2, R - next_min )]. 

        However, the sample output for the entire sequence is: 4,10,8,5,7.

        How do we generate that?

        We can simulate:

          Step0: L=1, R=10, c='>', next_min=5 (because min_size[1]=5? Actually, min_size[0]=6, min_size[1]=5, min_size[2]=4, min_size[3]=3, min_size[4]=2)

          Conditions for g0: 
              g0 <= min( (1+10-1)//2, 10-5) = min(5,5)=5.
          We choose 4? (which is between 1 and 5). Then update: L0 = 4+1=5, R0=10.

          Step1: [5,10], c='<', next_min= min_size[2]=4.
          Conditions: 
              g1 >= max(ceil((5+10)/2), 5+4) = max(ceil(15/2)=8, 9) -> so g1>=9? 
          But the sample output is 10? 

          Actually, step1: Theodora answers '<'. How can we get 10? 
          If we guess 10, then:
            Theodora: if the number is in [5,9] then the interval would be size 5, and if in [11,?] -> but no, we are in [5,10]. Actually, the number is in [5,10]. 
            Then if we guess 10:
               Theodora: 
                  If she answers '<': the interval becomes [5,9] (size 5)
                  If she answers '>': the interval becomes [11,10] -> empty -> not possible? 
            So she must answer '<'. 

          But the condition for Theodora to answer '<' is: 
              (g1 - L) >= (R - g1) -> (10-5=5) >= (10-10=0) -> true. 
          And the condition for the next interval: [5,9] must have at least next_min=4 -> 5 numbers? yes.

          So we can choose g1=10? 

          Then update: R1 = 10-1=9? 

          Then step1: new interval [5,9]

          Step2: [5,9], c='<', next_min=min_size[3]=3.
          Conditions: 
              g2 >= max(ceil((5+9)/2)=ceil(7)=7, 5+3=8) -> so g2>=8.
          We choose 8? 
          Then update: R2 = 8-1=7? -> [5,7]

          Step3: [5,7], c='>', next_min=min_size[4]=2.
          Conditions: 
              g3 <= min( (5+7-1)//2, 7-2) = min( (11)//2=5, 5) = 5.
          We choose 5? 
          Then update: L3 = 5+1=6 -> [6,7]

          Step4: [6,7], c='<', next_min=1 (last step) -> so g4>= max(ceil((6+7)/2)=ceil(6.5)=7, 6+1=7) -> so g4=7? 
          But the sample output is 7? 

          However, the sample output for the fourth step is 5? and fifth is 7? 

          Actually, the sample output: 4 10 8 5 7 -> so step3 is 5? and step4 is 7? 

          But step3: we are in [5,7] and we guess 5? Then Theodora answers '>'? 
            Then the interval becomes [6,7]. 
          Then step4: we are in [6,7] and we guess 7? Then Theodora answers '<'? 
            Then the interval becomes [6,6]? 
          But the answer is '<'? Then the game ends? 

          However, the sample input string is "><<><", so the last character is the fifth: '>'? 

          Actually, the sample input says: "><<><", meaning:
            step0: '>'
            step1: '<'
            step2: '<'
            step3: '>'
            step4: '<'

          But we have the fifth answer as '<', not '='. 

          Then we are at step4: [6,7] and we guess 7? 
            Theodora: 
               If she answers '<': then the next interval [6,6] -> but then the game ends? 
            But the answer we have for step4 is '<', which is consistent.

          However, the problem: the game ends after K guesses? Here K=5, so we made 5 guesses and we did not get an '=', so Theodora wins.

          Therefore, the sequence is valid.

          How do we get 5 at step3? 
            Conditions: 
              step3: [5,7] -> c='>' (so step3 is the fourth character: the '>' in the string at index3)
              next_min: since step3 is not the last (there is step4), we use min_size[4]=2? 
              Then for '>': 
                  g3 <= min( (5+7-1)//2 = (11)//2=5, 7-2=5) -> so g3<=5, and we can choose 5.

          Then update: L3 = 5+1=6 -> [6,7]

          Then step4: [6,7] -> c='<' (last character, so next_min=1)
                  g4 = max(ceil((6+7)/2)=ceil(6.5)=7, 6+1=7) -> so 7.

          Therefore, the sequence: [4,10,8,5,7] is generated.

        So we can adjust: we are free to choose any value in the valid range? But the problem says "you may output any of them". 

        However, the editorial suggests specific formulas: 
            For '<': g = max(ceil((L+R)/2), L+next_min)
            For '>': g = min(floor((L+R-1)/2), R - next_min)

        But in the first step we chose 4, which is not the minimal? Actually, the minimal for '>' is 1? But we can choose any value? 

        The problem: we must choose a guess that is consistent and that satisfies the two constraints. The editorial's formulas are one possible choice. But if we want to output the sample sequence, we need to choose 4 in the first step. How?

        We can do: 

          For '>': 
             We can choose any g in [L, min( (L+R-1)//2, R - next_min )]

          So we can choose 4? 

        But note: the editorial says: "If there are more than one possible scenario for Romanos' guesses, you may output any of them."

        Therefore, we can choose any value in the valid range. 

        How to choose? 

          We can choose the minimal value? the maximal value? 

          However, we must be cautious: the next steps depend on the chosen g. 

        But the problem: we only care about the current step. The current step constraints are:

          For '<' or '>' we have two constraints (Theodora condition and next interval size condition). 

        So we can choose arbitrarily? 

        However, the sample outputs use:

          Sample 1: [5,8,6,7] -> first guess 5 (which is the minimal for '>' in the first step? Actually, the minimal we can choose is 1? but 5 is the value from the editorial formula).

          Sample 2: [4,10,8,5,7] -> first guess 4.

        Therefore, we can design:

          For '>': we choose the minimal possible g? that is L? 

          But wait: if we choose g=L, then the Theodora condition: (R - L) > (L - L) = 0 -> which is true. 
          And the next interval: R - L >= next_min? -> (R - L) >= next_min? 

          But if (R-L) < next_min, then we output -1 at the condition check. So we have already ensured that the current interval has at least min_size[i] (which is at least next_min+1). 

          However, the condition for '>' is g <= min( (L+R-1)//2, R - next_min ). The minimal g we can choose is L? 

          Similarly, for '<', we can choose R? 

        But the sample output for the second sample uses 4 (which is above the minimal 1) and 10 (which is the maximal in the range for step1).

        Therefore, we can choose any value? 

        How about: 

          For the first sample, we choose the value from the editorial formula? 
          For the second sample, we choose the value that matches the sample? 

        But the problem does not require a particular sequence.

        However, we must be efficient: the constraints are large (N up to 10^18, K up to 50000). 

        The operations we do are integer arithmetic, so we can choose any value in the range? The range might be huge? 

        Actually, we have:

          For '<': g in [max(ceil((L+R)/2), L+next_min), R] 
          For '>': g in [L, min(floor((L+R-1)/2), R - next_min)]

        The length of the interval for g might be huge? 

        But we are free to choose any. 

        To make the next interval as large as possible? Actually, we don't care. 

        Therefore, we can choose:

          For '<': choose the minimal g that satisfies the conditions? i.e., g0 = max(ceil((L+R)/2), L+next_min)
          For '>': choose the maximal g that satisfies the conditions? i.e., g0 = min(floor((L+R-1)/2), R - next_min)  [but wait: the sample output for the first step of the second sample is 4, which is not the maximal? the maximal in [1,5] is 5. But they chose 4. So we can choose arbitrarily?]

        Actually, the problem says: Romanos can choose any consistent guess. 

        Therefore, to match the sample outputs, we don't have to. But we must be efficient.

        However, note: if we choose the minimal g for '>', then the next interval [g+1, R] is as large as possible? which might help in the future? 

        But we know the entire future answers. The min_size array already ensures that the next interval is large enough for the future. 

        Therefore, we can choose arbitrarily. 

        But the problem: we must choose a guess that is consistent. 

        How about we choose the minimal g for '>' and the maximal g for '<'? 

        Actually, the sample outputs:

          Sample1: 
             step0: '>' -> we chose g=5 (which is the maximal for the minimal? Actually, it's the minimal for the maximal? It's the value from the formula).

          Sample2: 
             step0: '>' -> we want 4? which is the minimal? 

        But the sample output for sample2: step0 is 4 (minimal) and step1 is 10 (maximal for the range?).

        How about we do:

          For '<': choose g = max(ceil((L+R)/2), L+next_min)   [the minimal g that satisfies both conditions]
          For '>': choose g = L   [the minimal g]? 

        But then sample2: step0 would choose g0 = 1? 

        Then step1: [2,10] and c='<' -> then we need g1 = max(ceil((2+10)/2)=6, 2+min_size[2]=2+4=6) -> 6? 
        Then step2: [2,5] and c='<' -> g2 = max(ceil((2+5)/2)=4, 2+min_size[3]=2+3=5) -> 5? 
        Then step3: [2,4] and c='>' -> g3 = 2? 
        Then step4: [3,4] and c='<' -> g4 = max(ceil((3+4)/2)=4, 3+1=4) -> 4? 

        Then the sequence: [1,6,5,2,4] -> which is valid? 

        But the problem does not require a particular sequence.

        However, the sample output is [4,10,8,5,7]. 

        How can we output [4,10,8,5,7]? 

        We can let the user choose? But the problem: we must output one.

        Since the problem says "any", we can choose arbitrarily. However, the sample outputs provided in the problem are specific.

        How about we choose:

          For step0: '>', we choose 4? 
          For step1: '<', we choose 10? 
          For step2: '<', we choose 8? 
          For step3: '>', we choose 5? 
          For step4: '<', we choose 7? 

        How do we encode that? 

        We are free to choose any value in the valid range. 

        But the problem: we must output a sequence. 

        We can choose the value that matches the sample? But we don't know the sample.

        Alternatively, we can choose the minimal g for '>' and the maximal g for '<'? 

        Then for step0: '>' -> g = L (which is 1) 
        Then step1: '<' -> g = R (which is 10) 
        Then step2: '<' -> g = R (which is 9? because after step1: L=2, R=10; after step0: we update L=1+1=2, then step1: we guess 10? then for '<' we update R=10-1=9 -> then step2: [2,9] -> then we choose g = 9? 
        Then step3: [2,8] and c='>' -> we choose g=L=2? 
        Then step4: [3,8] and c='<' -> we choose g=R=8? 

        Then the sequence: [1,10,9,2,8] 

        But the sample output is [4,10,8,5,7]. 

        How about we choose the maximal g for '>' and the minimal g for '<'? 

        Step0: '>' -> g = min( (1+10-1)//2, 10-5) = 5? 
        Step1: '<' -> g = max(ceil((6+10)/2), 6+4)=max(8,10) -> 10? 
        Step2: [6,9] -> '<' -> g = max(ceil((6+9)/2)=8, 6+3=9) -> 9? 
        Step3: [6,8] -> '>' -> g = min( (6+8-1)//2, 8-2) = min( (13//2)=6, 6) = 6? 
        Step4: [7,8] -> '<' -> g = max(ceil((7+8)/2)=8, 7+1=8) -> 8? 
        Then sequence: [5,10,9,6,8] 

        Not the sample.

        How to get the sample? 

        Step0: '>' -> we choose 4? (which is in the valid range [1,5] and we choose 4 arbitrarily) 
        Step1: '<' -> we choose 10? (valid: g in [max(ceil((5+10)/2)=8, 5+4=9), 10] -> so g in [9,10] -> we choose 10? 
        Step2: [5,9] -> '<' -> we choose 8? (g in [max(ceil((5+9)/2)=7, 5+3=8),9] -> so [8,9] -> choose 8) 
        Step3: [5,7] -> '>' -> we choose 5? (g in [5, min((5+7-1)//2= (11//2)=5, 7-2=5)] = [5,5] -> choose 5)
        Step4: [6,7] -> '<' -> we choose 7? (g in [max(ceil((6+7)/2)=7, 6+1=7),7] = [7,7] -> choose 7)

        Therefore, to get the sample, we must:

          For step0: choose 4 (which is the minimal value in the valid range? but 1 is minimal, we choose 4 arbitrarily) 
          For step1: choose 10 (the maximal in the valid range [9,10])
          For step2: choose 8 (the minimal in [8,9])
          For step3: choose 5 (the only choice)
          For step4: choose 7 (the only choice)

        How to implement arbitrary choice? The problem does not specify. 

        However, the editorial guidelines say: 

          For '<': g = max(ceil((L+R)/2), L+next_min)   -> which is the minimal possible g? 
          For '>': g = min(floor((L+R-1)/2), R - next_min) -> which is the maximal? Actually, it's the minimal of the two bounds, but that is the maximal possible g? 

        Actually, the expression for '>' gives the maximal g that satisfies the constraints? 

          Condition: g <= (L+R-1)//2 and g <= R - next_min.
          Then g = min( (L+R-1)//2, R - next_min ) -> this is the maximal g? 

        But wait: we can choose any g from L to that value. The value we compute is the upper bound. Then the minimal g we can choose is L, and the maximal g we can choose is min( (L+R-1)//2, R - next_min ). 

        Similarly, for '<' the minimal g we can choose is max(ceil((L+R)/2), L+next_min), and the maximal is R.

        Therefore, to match the sample outputs:

          In sample2:
            Step0: '>' -> we want 4? which is not the maximal (the maximal is 5). 
            Step1: '<' -> we want 10? which is the maximal.

        How about we let the user choose by a fixed rule: 

          For '<': choose the maximal g? 
          For '>': choose the minimal g? 

        Then:

          Step0: '>' -> choose L (which is 1) -> not 4.

        Alternatively, we can choose:

          For '<': choose the maximal g? which is R.
          For '>': choose the minimal g? which is L.

        Then the sequence for sample2: [1,10,9,2,8] as above.

        How about we choose:

          For '<': choose the minimal g? (which is max(ceil((L+R)/2), L+next_min))
          For '>': choose the maximal g? (which is min( (L+R-1)//2, R - next_min ))   [but note: the maximal g we can choose is min( (L+R-1)//2, R - next_min ), so we choose that value]

        Then:

          Step0: '>' -> g0 = min( (1+10-1)//2, 10-5) = min(5,5)=5 -> but we want 4.

        How about we choose the minimal g that satisfies the constraints for '>' is 1, and we want 4. 

        Alternatively, we can choose the value that is R - next_min? 

        Step0: R - next_min = 10-5=5 -> we choose 5? 

        Step1: '<' -> g1 = max(ceil((6+10)/2)=8, 6+4=10) = 10 -> then we choose 10? 
        Step2: [6,9] -> '<' -> g2 = max(ceil((6+9)/2)=8, 6+3=9) = 9? 
        Step3: [6,8] -> '>' -> g3 = min( (6+8-1)//2, 8-2) = min( (13//2)=6, 6) = 6? 
        Step4: [7,8] -> '<' -> g4 = max(ceil((7+8)/2)=8, 7+1=8)=8? 

        Sequence: [5,10,9,6,8] -> not the sample.

        After reading the problem statement again: Romanos pretends that he plays seriously, so his guess will never be a dumb one. But he does not always use the best strategy. So we are free to choose any consistent guess.

        Therefore, we can choose arbitrarily.

        However, the sample output [4,10,8,5,7] is provided. How did they get 4? 

        For step0: 
          The constraints: 
            g0 must be in [1,5] (because g0<=5) 
          They chose 4.

        How about we choose g = L + (some offset) that we store in a list? 

        But we don't have a list.

        Alternatively, we can simulate the reverse? 

        Actually, we can generate the entire sequence backwards? 

        But the problem: we are given the answers.

        Since the problem does not specify which sequence to output, we can choose one that is easy to compute and efficient.

        I propose:

          For '<': we choose the minimal g that satisfies the conditions: g_min = max(ceil((L+R)/2), L+next_min)
          For '>': we choose the minimal g that satisfies the conditions: g_min = L   [but we must check that L is in the valid range? It is, because L is at least L, and we know L<=min( (L+R-1)//2, R - next_min )? Not necessarily. 

        Actually, the minimal g for '>' is L, but we have the condition: 
            Theodora: (R-L) > (L-L) = 0 -> always true.
            Next interval: R - L >= next_min? -> we have already checked that the current interval has at least min_size[i] (which is next_min+1). But note: the current interval [L,R] has size R-L+1 >= min_size[i] = next_min+1 -> so R-L+1 >= next_min+1 -> R-L >= next_min -> condition holds.

        Therefore, for '>' we can always choose g = L.

        Similarly, for '<' we can always choose g = R? 

        But wait: for '<' we have the condition: 
            Theodora: (R-L) >= (R-R)=0 -> true? 
            Next interval: R-1 - L + 1 = R - L >= next_min? 
            But we have R-L+1 >= min_size[i] = next_min+1 -> R-L >= next_min -> condition holds.

        Therefore, we can choose:

          For '<': g = R
          For '>': g = L

        Then the simulation:

          Sample1: "><>="

            Step0: [1,10], c='>' -> g0 = L0=1 -> update: L1 = 1+1=2, R1=10.
            Step1: [2,10], c='<' -> g1 = R1=10 -> update: R2 = 10-1=9.
            Step2: [2,9], c='>' -> g2 = L2=2 -> update: L3=2+1=3, R3=9.
            Step3: [3,9], c='=' -> but we have an interval of size 7, not 1 -> output -1? 

          So that fails.

        Why? Step3: we have an interval [3,9] and we need to output '='? But we cannot. 

        Therefore, we must choose a guess that leaves the interval for the next steps with the required min_size. 

        But note: the min_size[3]=1, so we need the interval to be of size 1. But after step2 we have [3,9] (size 7). 

        How did we get here? 

        The problem: we are free to choose the guess arbitrarily within the constraints? But we didn't check the constraints for the next interval? 

        We did: 
          Step0: we had to have min_size[0]=4, and [1,10] has 10>=4 -> ok. 
          Then we chose g0=1, which is valid for '>'. 
          Step1: [2,10] has size 9 >= min_size[1]=3 -> ok. 
          Then we chose g1=10, valid for '<': 
               Theodora condition: (10-2=8) >= (10-10=0) -> true.
               Next interval: [2,9] -> size 8>=min_size[2]=2 -> ok.
          Step2: [2,9] has size 8>=min_size[2]=2 -> ok.
          Then we chose g2=2, valid for '>':
               Theodora: (9-2=7) > (2-2=0) -> true.
               Next interval: [3,9] -> size 7>=min_size[3]=1 -> ok.

          Then step3: [3,9] has size 7>=min_size[3]=1 -> ok, but we have to output '=' -> which requires L=R? 

          So we output -1 at step3? 

        Therefore, we must choose the guesses more carefully.

        The editorial's choice (using the bounds) ensures that the next interval is exactly the minimal size? 

        But in sample1, the editorial choice works.

        Why? In sample1, the editorial choice for step0: '>' -> g0=5 -> then [6,10] -> size 5.
          step1: '<' -> g1=8 -> then [6,7] -> size 2.
          step2: '>' -> g2=6 -> then [7,7] -> size 1.
          step3: '=' -> 7.

        So we do:

          For '<': g = max(ceil((L+R)/2), L+next_min)
          For '>': g = min( (L+R-1)//2, R - next_min )

        This ensures that the next interval is exactly the minimal size? 

        For '>', the next interval size is R - g, and we require R - g >= next_min. 
          We set g = min( (L+R-1)//2, R - next_min )
          Then the next interval size = R - g = 
              if (L+R-1)//2 <= R - next_min, then g = (L+R-1)//2, and the next interval size = R - (L+R-1)//2.
              else, g = R - next_min, then next interval size = next_min.

        Similarly, for '<': next interval size = g - L, and we set g = max(ceil((L+R)/2), L+next_min), so the next interval size = 
              if ceil((L+R)/2) >= L+next_min, then g = ceil((L+R)/2), next interval size = ceil((L+R)/2) - L.
              else, g = L+next_min, then next interval size = next_min.

        This might not be the minimal next interval size, but we ensure that the next interval has at least next_min.

        And the Theodora condition is satisfied.

        And the sample1 works, sample2 we get [5,10,9,6,8] which is valid? 

        But the problem sample output for sample2 is [4,10,8,5,7] which is also valid.

        Therefore, we follow the editorial formulas.

        Steps:

          Precompute min_size[0..M-1] (M = len(s))

          L=1, R=N
          guesses = []

          for i in range(M):
             if R - L + 1 < min_size[i]:
                 print(-1)
                 return

             if s[i]=='=':
                 if L != R:
                     print(-1)
                     return
                 guesses.append(L)
                 # After this, we break? But the for loop goes to M, and we are at the last step? 
                 # But note: the problem says the last character is '=', so i must be M-1. 
                 # We don't need to break immediately, but the next steps would not occur? 
                 # However, we are at the last step? 
             else:
                 if i == M-1:
                     next_min = 1
                 else:
                     next_min = min_size[i+1]

                 if s[i]=='<':
                     g = max( (L+R+1)//2, L+next_min )
                     if g > R:
                         print(-1)
                         return
                     guesses.append(g)
                     R = g - 1
                 else: # '>' 
                     g = min( (L+R-1)//2, R - next_min )
                     if g < L:
                         print(-1)
                         return
                     guesses.append(g)
                     L = g + 1

          Then output the guesses.

        Let's test the sample that outputs -1: "10 5\n<>="

          s = "<>=", M=3.

          min_size[2]=1 (because '=')
          min_size[1]=min_size[2]+1=2
          min_size[0]=min_size[1]+1=3

          Step0: [1,10] -> c='<'
                 next_min = min_size[1]=2
                 g = max( (1+10+1)//2, 1+2 ) = max(12//2=6, 3) = 6.
                 Then update: R = 6-1=5.

          Step1: [1,5] -> c='>'
                 next_min = min_size[2]=1
                 g = min( (1+5-1)//2, 5-1) = min(5//2=2, 4) = 2.
                 Then update: L = 2+1=3.

          Step2: [3,5] -> c='=' -> but [3,5] has size 3, not 1 -> output -1.

          Matches sample.

        Another sample: "10 9\n>>>>>>>>" (8 '>', so M=8)

          min_size[7]=2
          min_size[6]=3
          min_size[5]=4
          min_size[4]=5
          min_size[3]=6
          min_size[2]=7
          min_size[1]=8
          min_size[0]=9

          Step0: [1,10] -> c='>', next_min = min_size[1]=8
                 g = min( (1+10-1)//2, 10-8) = min(10//2=5, 2) = 2.
                 Then L = 3, R=10.

          Step1: [3,10] -> c='>', next_min = min_size[2]=7
                 g = min( (3+10-1)//2, 10-7) = min(12//2=6, 3)=3.
                 Then L=4, R=10.

          Step2: [4,10] -> c='>', next_min=min_size[3]=6
                 g = min( (4+10-1)//2, 10-6) = min(13//2=6, 4)=4.
                 Then L=5, R=10.

          Step3: [5,10] -> c='>', next_min=min_size[4]=5
                 g = min( (5+10-1)//2, 10-5)=min(14//2=7,5)=5.
                 Then L=6, R=10.

          Step4: [6,10] -> c='>', next_min=min_size[5]=4
                 g = min( (6+10-1)//2, 10-4)=min(15//2=7,6)=6.
                 Then L=7, R=10.

          Step5: [7,10] -> c='>', next_min=min_size[6]=3
                 g = min( (7+10-1)//2, 10-3)=min(16//2=8,7)=7.
                 Then L=8, R=10.

          Step6: [8,10] -> c='>', next_min=min_size[7]=2
                 g = min( (8+10-1)//2, 10-2)=min(17//2=8,8)=8.
                 Then L=9, R=10.

          Step7: [9,10] -> c='>' (last step, next_min=1)
                 g = min( (9+10-1)//2, 10-1)=min(18//2=9,9)=9.
                 Then L=10, R=10? Actually, update: L=9+1=10.

          Then the sequence: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

          And the sample output is "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9" -> but wait, we have 8 guesses, but the sample input has 8 '>'? 

          The sample input: "10 9\n>>>>>>>>" -> 8 characters, so we output 8 guesses.

          But the sample output is 9 guesses? 

          Actually, the sample output is: "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9" -> 9 numbers? 

          But the input says: K=9, and the string is 8 '>'? 

          The problem: the string length is either:
             - ending with '=' and length <= K, or
             - length exactly K and no '='.

          Here: length=8 and K=9, and there is no '=' -> so it should be the first case? no, the first case requires the last character is '='. 

          Actually, the input is: "10 9\n>>>>>>>>" -> 8 '>' characters? 

          So it does not have '=' and length is 8, which is less than K=9? 

          But the problem says: 
            "either:
               - The last character of the string is '=' and each character of the string other than the last character is either '<' or '>', and the length of the string is not more than K, or
               - The length of the string is exactly K and each character of the string is either '<' or '>'

          This input: length=8, which is less than K=9, but the last character is not '=' -> so it doesn't fit the first case. 
          And the second case: the length must be exactly K (9), but it's 8 -> so it's invalid? 

          But the problem says we are given the input as described.

          Therefore, we assume the input is as described.

          How about the sample input "10 9\n>>>>>>>>" has 8 characters? Then we output 8 guesses.

          The sample output has 9 numbers? 

          Actually, the sample output says: 
             Input: "10 9\n>>>>>>>>"
             Output: "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9"

          But this output has 9 numbers, which is more than the string length (8)? 

          This is inconsistent.

        I re-read the sample input: 
            "10 9\n>>>>>>>>"

          The string has 8 '>' characters.

          The problem says: the output should be M integers (M = length of the string).

          So we output 8 integers.

          But the sample output is 9 integers? 

        Actually, the sample output in the problem is:

            # Sample Input
            "10 9\n>>>>>>>>"
            # Output for Sample Input
            "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9"

          But that output has 9 integers, and the string has 8 characters? 

          This is a discrepancy.

        I see: the problem says "The second line contains a string", and the sample input ">>>>>>>>" has 8 characters. 

        But the output has 9 integers? 

        This is an error in the sample? 

        Let me check the problem statement: 
            "For example, suppose $N$ is $10$ and Romanos' first guess is $4$. If Theodora answers ..."

        And the sample input: 
            "10 5
            ><>=" -> output "5 8 6 7" (4 integers)

            "10 5
            ><<><" -> output "4 10 8 5 7" (5 integers)

            "10 5
            <>=" -> output -1

            "10 9
            >>>>>>>>" -> output "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9"

          The last one: the string has 8 '>'? but the output has 9 numbers? 

        I think the sample input "10 9\n>>>>>>>>" is meant to have 9 characters? 

        Let me count: ">>>>>>>>" has 8 characters. 

        But the problem says: the second case is "The length of the string is exactly K and each character ...". So if K=9, the string must be 9 characters. 

        Therefore, the sample input should be ">>>>>>>>>" (9 '>') for K=9.

        And the sample output "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9" has 9 integers.

        And the next sample: 
            "10 10\n>>>>>>>>>>" (10 '>') -> output -1.

        So we assume the string length M is the number of answers.

        Therefore, the sample input "10 9\n>>>>>>>>" is actually 8 characters? 

        But the problem says: K=9. And the string must be either of the two forms.

        Since the problem says the string has 8 characters, and K=9, and the string does not end with '=' (so it must be of the second form: length exactly K) -> but 8 != 9 -> so it's an invalid input? 

        But the problem says: "each character of the string" ... so we assume the input is valid.

        How about the problem: the string length M can be at most K.

        And the second case: if there is no '=' then M must be K.

        Therefore, if the string has no '=' and M < K, then it's invalid? 

        But the problem says: the input is given as described.

        Therefore, we assume the input is as described.

        So for the sample "10 9\n>>>>>>>>" (8 '>') -> it does not end with '=' and M=8 !=9 (K) -> so it's invalid? 

        But the problem sample says: output "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9"

        This is confusing.

        I see: the problem says: 
            "The second line contains a string in a line denoting Theodora's answers."

          and then: 
            "either:
               - The last character of the string is '=' and each character of the string other than the last character is either '<' or '>', and the length of the string is not more than K, or
               - The length of the string is exactly K and each character of the string is either '<' or '>'"

          So the first sample input: "10 9\n>>>>>>>>" has M=8, and it has no '=', so it must be the second case? But the second case requires M=K=9 -> fails.

        Therefore, the input is invalid? 

        But the problem sample provides it.

        Alternatively, the problem might have intended the string to be 9 '>' for the sample input "10 9\n>>>>>>>>>".

        And the sample output is 9 integers.

        So we assume the input has exactly M = length(s) and M satisfies the conditions.

        How about the last sample: 
            Input: "10 10\n>>>>>>>>>>" 
            Output: -1

          Precompute min_size for M=10:
            min_size[9]=2
            min_size[8]=3
            ... min_size[0]=11

          Step0: [1,10] -> min_size[0]=11 -> 10 < 11 -> output -1.

        So we output -1.

        Therefore, the algorithm:

          M = len(s)
          Precompute min_size[0..M-1] as described.

          L=1, R=N
          guesses = []

          for i in range(M):
             size = R - L + 1
             if size < min_size[i]:
                 print(-1)
                 return

             c = s[i]
             if c == '=':
                 # Must be the last? 
                 if i != M-1:
                     # Actually, the problem says it's the last, so we can assume i==M-1? 
                     # But if not, then we break the condition? 
                     # Let's output -1 if not last and c is '='? 
                     # The problem: the last character is '='. So if we get '=' not at the last, it's invalid? 
                     print(-1)
                     return
                 else:
                     if L == R:
                         guesses.append(L)
                     else:
                         print(-1)
                         return
             else:
                 if i == M-1:
                     next_min = 1
                 else:
                     next_min = min_size[i+1]

                 if c == '<':
                     g = max( (L+R+1)//2, L+next_min )
                     if g > R:
                         print(-1)
                         return
                     guesses.append(g)
                     # Update for '<': the number is in [L, g-1]
                     R = g - 1
                 else: # '>'
                     g = min( (L+R-1)//2, R - next_min )
                     if g < L:
                         print(-1)
                         return
                     guesses.append(g)
                     L = g + 1

          # After the loop, output the guesses
          print(" ".join(str(x) for x in guesses))

        Note: we use integer arithmetic: 
          (L+R+1)//2 is ceil((L+R)/2)
          (L+R-1)//2 is floor((L+R)/2) when L+R is even? Actually, 
            For even: L+R = 2k -> (2k-1)//2 = k-1, which is floor((2k)/2)-1? 
          Actually, we want g such that 2g < L+R -> g < (L+R)/2 -> the largest integer g satisfying that is floor((L+R-1)/2)? 

          Example: L=1, R=10 -> we want g such that (10-g) > (g-1) -> g < 5.5 -> so g<=5.
          (1+10-1)//2 = 10//2=5.

          But if L=1, R=9 -> then we want g < (1+9)/2 = 5 -> g<=4.
          (1+9-1)//2 = 9//2=4.

        Therefore, (L+R-1)//2 is the floor of (L+R-1)/2? But note: 
          (1+9-1)=9, 9//2=4 -> which is the maximal g satisfying g<5.

        So it is correct.

        Let's test the sample that outputs -1: 
            "10 10\n>>>>>>>>>>" (10 '>') -> M=10
            min_size[0]=min_size[1]+1, ... min_size[9]=2, min_size[8]=3, ... min_size[0]=11.
            Step0: [1,10] -> 10 < 11 -> output -1.

        Done.

        Now, the sample "10 9\n>>>>>>>>>" (9 '>', which is the correct length for K=9) -> 

          min_size[8]=2
          min_size[7]=3
          min_size[6]=4
          min_size[5]=5
          min_size[4]=6
          min_size[3]=7
          min_size[2]=8
          min_size[1]=9
          min_size[0]=10

          Step0: [1,10] -> min_size[0]=10, size=10>=10 -> ok.
                 c='>' -> next_min=min_size[1]=9
                 g = min( (1+10-1)//2, 10-9) = min(10//2=5, 1) = 1.
                 Then L=2, R=10.

          Step1: [2,10] -> min_size[1]=9, size=9>=9 -> ok.
                 g = min( (2+10-1)//2, 10-8) = min(11//2=5, 2)=2 -> g=2? 
                 Then L=3, R=10.

          Step2: [3,10] -> min_size[2]=8, size=8>=8 -> ok.
                 g = min( (3+10-1)//2, 10-7) = min(12//2=6, 3)=3.
                 Then L=4, R=10.

          Step3: [4,10] -> min_size[3]=7, size=7>=7 -> ok.
                 g = min( (4+10-1)//2, 10-6)=min(13//2=6, 4)=4.
                 Then L=5, R=10.

          Step4: [5,10] -> min_size[4]=6, size=6>=6 -> ok.
                 g = min( (5+10-1)//2, 10-5)=min(14//2=7,5)=5.
                 Then L=6, R=10.

          Step5: [6,10] -> min_size[5]=5, size=5>=5 -> ok.
                 g = min( (6+10-1)//2, 10-4)=min(15//2=7,6)=6.
                 Then L=7, R=10.

          Step6: [7,10] -> min_size[6]=4, size=4>=4 -> ok.
                 g = min( (7+10-1)//2, 10-3)=min(16//2=8,7)=7.
                 Then L=8, R=10.

          Step7: [8,10] -> min_size[7]=3, size=3>=3 -> ok.
                 g = min( (8+10-1)//2, 10-2)=min(17//2=8,8)=8.
                 Then L=9, R=10.

          Step8: [9,10] -> min_size[8]=2, size=2>=2 -> ok.
                 g = min( (9+10-1)//2, 10-1)=min(18//2=9,9)=9.
                 Then L=10, R=10.

          Then we output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

        But the sample output is the same.

        Therefore, we output: 
          for the sample "10 9\n>>>>>>>>>": [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

        But note: the sample input says ">>>>>>>>" (8) and K=9? -> we assumed 9. But the problem sample input says "10 9" and a string of 9 '>', so we have to read the input.

        How to read the input:

          first line: N, K
          second line: a string s (without any extra space)

        Then M = len(s)

        Then we do the algorithm.

        We are done.

        Code:

          Steps:
            Read N, K
            Read s

            M = len(s)

            # Precompute min_size: array of length M
            min_size = [0]*M
            if M>0:
                if s[-1]=='=':
                    min_size[-1]=1
                else:
                    min_size[-1]=2
                # Traverse backwards from M-2 to 0
                for i in range(M-2, -1, -1):
                    min_size[i] = min_size[i+1]+1

            L=1
            R=N
            guesses = []

            for i in range(M):
                # Check current interval size
                if R < L:  # empty, but we check size below
                    pass
                current_size = R - L + 1
                if current_size < min_size[i]:
                    print(-1)
                    return

                c = s[i]
                if c == '=':
                    # Check if it's the last?
                    if i != M-1:
                        # According to the problem, '=' must be last. So if we find it not last, it's invalid.
                        print(-1)
                        return

            # Output the guesses
            print(" ".join(str(x) for x in guesses))

        Let's test the provided samples.

        Sample1: "10 5\n><>="
          s = "><>=", M=4.
          min_size: 
            min_size[3]=1 (since '=')
            min_size[2]=2
            min_size[1]=3
            min_size[0]=4

          Step0: [1,10], c='>' -> next_min = min_size[1]=3 -> g = min( (1+10-1)//2=5, 10-3=7) = 5 -> guess 5 -> update L=6, R=10.
          Step1: [6,10], c='<' -> next_min = min_size[2]=2 -> g = max( (6+10+1)//2= (17//2)=8, 6+2=8) = 8 -> update R=7.
          Step2: [6,7], c='>' -> next_min = min_size[3]=1 -> g = min( (6+7-1)//2= (12//2)=6, 7-1=6) = 6 -> update L=7.
          Step3: [7,7], c='=' -> append 7.

          Output: [5,8,6,7] -> matches.

        Sample2: "10 5\n><<><"
          s = "><<><", M=5.
          min_size[4]=2
          min_size[3]=3
          min_size[2]=4
          min_size[1]=5
          min_size[0]=6

          Step0: [1,10], c='>' -> next_min=5 -> g = min( (1+10-1)//2=5, 10-5=5) =5 -> update L=6, R=10.
          Step1: [6,10], c='<' -> next_min=4 -> g = max( (6+10+1)//2= (17//2)=8, 6+4=10) =10 -> update R=9.
          Step2: [6,9], c='<' -> next_min=3 -> g = max( (6+9+1)//2= (16//2)=8, 6+3=9) =9 -> update R=8.
          Step3: [6,8], c='>' -> next_min=2 -> g = min( (6+8-1)//2= (13//2)=6, 8-2=6) =6 -> update L=7.
          Step4: [7,8], c='<' -> next_min=1 -> g = max( (7+8+1)//2= (16//2)=8, 7+1=8) =8 -> update R=7.
          Then the next state is [7,7] but we have finished.

          Output: [5,10,9,6,8]

          But the sample output is "4 10 8 5 7"

          However, the problem says "you may output any of them". So both are valid.

        Therefore, we output the sequence as computed.

        We'll run the code on the sample inputs and see if we get the expected outputs.

        The sample that outputs -1: "10 5\n<>=" -> we already tested: outputs -1.

        The sample "10 10\n>>>>>>>>>>" -> outputs -1.

        The sample "10 9\n>>>>>>>>>" -> outputs "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9"

        So we are good.

        Code:

          Note: we must use integers and be careful for large N (up to 10^18) and K (up to 50000). The min_size array is of size M (<=50000). 

          The operations: we do a loop of M steps, and each step we do a few integer operations.

        Let's code accordingly.

        Important: when updating L and R, we use integer arithmetic.

        We assume that the input is valid as described.

        Code Implementation:

          Steps:

            import sys

            data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()
            if not data: 
                return
            first_line = data[0].split()
            N = int(first_line[0])
            K = int(first_line[1])
            s = data[1].strip()

            M = len(s)

            # Precompute min_size: an array of M integers
            min_size = [0] * M
            if M > 0:
                if s[-1] == '=':
                    min_size[M-1] = 1
                else:
                    min_size[M-1] = 2

                # Build backwards from M-2 down to 0
                for i in range(M-2, -1, -1):

            L = 1

            guesses = []

                if R < L:
                    # The interval is empty -> we break with -1

                    return

                current_size = R - L + 1
                if current_size < min_size[i]:
                    print(-1)
                    return

                c = s[i]
                if c == '=':
                    if i != M-1:
                        # '=' must be the last
                        print(-1)
                        return
                    else:
                        if L == R:
                            guesses.append(L)
                        else:

                    else:
                        next_min = min_size[i+1]

                    if c == '<':

                        cand2 = L + next_min
                        g = cand1
                        if cand2 > g:
                            g = cand2
                        # Now, g must be at least L and at most R? But we have constraints: g>=cand1 and g>=cand2, and cand1 and cand2 might be > R?
                        if g > R:
                            print(-1)
                            return
                        guesses.append(g)
                        # Update R for '<'
                        R = g - 1

                        cand1 = (L + R - 1) // 2   # floor((L+R-1)/2) -> maximal g for which the condition holds
                        cand2 = R - next_min
                        g = cand1
                        if cand2 < g:
                            g = cand2
                        if g < L:
                            print(-1)
                            return
                        guesses.append(g)
                        L = g + 1

            # Output the guesses
            print(" ".join(str(x) for x in guesses))

        Let's run the provided samples.

        We'll run the sample "10 5\n><>=" and "10 5\n><<><" to see.

        But note: the second sample we get [5,10,9,6,8] which is valid? 
          Step0: guess 5 -> answer '>' -> then the number is in [6,10] -> valid.
          Step1: guess 10 -> answer '<' -> then the number is in [6,9] -> valid.
          Step2: guess 9 -> answer '<' -> then the number is in [6,8] -> valid.
          Step3: guess 6 -> answer '>' -> then the number is in [7,8] -> valid.
          Step4: guess 8 -> answer '<' -> then the number is in [7,7] -> valid? But the answer is '<', meaning the number is less than 8 -> which is 7 -> valid.

        So Theodora's answers: 
            step0: '>' -> 
            step1: '<'
            step2: '<'
            step3: '>'
            step4: '<'

        which matches the input string? 

        The input string: "><<><" -> 
          step0: '>' -> matches
          step1: '<' -> matches
          step2: '<' -> matches
          step3: '>' -> matches
          step4: '<' -> matches.

        Therefore, it's valid.

        We output the code accordingly.

        Note: we must be cautious for the case when M=0? 
          Then we output nothing? 

        The problem: 
          "The second line contains a string", so M can be 0? 
          But the constraints: 1<=N, 1<=K. 
          The string: if M=0, then we output nothing? 

        But the problem: Romanos makes up to K guesses. If the string is empty, it means he made 0 guesses? 

        The problem does not say that the string has at least one character? 

        The constraints: K>=1, but M (the length of the string) can be 0? 

        According to the problem, the string is either:
          - ending with '=' and length<=K, or 
          - length exactly K and no '='.

        If M=0, then it doesn't have an '=' and the length is 0, which is not equal to K (>=1) -> so invalid? 

        Therefore, we assume M>=0, but if M=0 and K>=1, then it's the second case? but 0 != K (>=1) -> invalid? 

        So we output -1? 

        But the problem says: the string is given. 

        How about the game: if M=0, then Romanos made 0 guesses? Then he didn't win? 

        The problem: the output is a sequence of M integers. So if M=0, we output nothing (an empty line).

        However, the problem says: if there is no possible scenario, output -1.

        But the input M=0: 
          Then the min_size array is of length 0 -> no steps.

          Then we do not enter the loop.

          Then we output the empty guesses: an empty line.

        But the problem: is M=0 valid? 
          Theodora's number is in [1,N], and Romanos made 0 guesses -> he loses. 
          But the problem says: the game will end after K guesses (which is 0) -> then he loses.

          But the string of answers is empty -> consistent? 

          However, the problem input condition: 
            either: 
               - last char is '=' -> fails because no last char.
               - length is exactly K (which is at least 1) -> fails because M=0 != K.

          So the input is invalid? 

        We'll assume the input is valid as described, so M=0 is not described.

        Since the problem does not specify, we can output the empty list? 

        But the problem says: the output is M integers. So for M=0, we output an empty line.

        However, the problem says: if there is no possible scenario, output -1.

        But the scenario: Romanos made 0 guesses -> so no guess to output -> we output the empty list.

        And it's a valid scenario? 

        Therefore, we do:

          if M==0: 
              print empty line? 

        But the problem: we are not told that M=0 is possible. The constraints: N>=1, K>=1, and the string is given. The problem sample inputs have positive M.

        We'll assume that M>=1? 

        But the problem says: the length of the string is not more than K (if it ends with '=') or exactly K (if not). So M can be 0? 

        Actually, the first case: "the last character of the string is '='" -> if the string is empty, there is no last character. So the first case fails. The second case: length exactly K? then M=K. So if K>=1, then M>=1.

        Therefore, we can assume M>=1.

        So we don't need to handle M=0.

        Code:

          We'll run the above.

        Let me test with the sample that has M=0? 
          We skip.

        We run the provided examples.

        We'll run the sample: "10 5\n><>=" -> [5,8,6,7] -> as above.

        And "10 5\n><<><" -> [5,10,9,6,8] -> which is valid.

        The sample "10 5\n<>=": we output -1.

        The sample "10 9\n>>>>>>>>>": [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] -> as above.

        The sample "10 10\n>>>>>>>>>>": -1.

        We output the code.

        Note: the min_size array might be large? M up to 50000 -> that's acceptable.

        Let me write the code accordingly.
