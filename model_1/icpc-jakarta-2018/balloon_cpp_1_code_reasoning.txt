 Okay, we are given N, M and two arrays A and B.
 Steps:
 1. First, we need to compute how many tasks Ayu can solve in M minutes. Since she must solve in order, we can simulate (but note: N up to 100000, and M up to 10^9). We can do a simple prefix sum for A, and then find the maximum k such that the total time for the first k tasks <= M. Let kA = Ayu's solved tasks.

 2. However, note that Ayu might not need to solve all the tasks she can? Actually, she must solve in order and we are to maximize. So kA is fixed.

 3. Now, if kA == 0, then she has no balloon to pop. Then we must check: if she solves 0, then Budi solves some tasks. We need to check if Budi can solve at least 0? Actually, if kA==0, then Ayu has 0. We need Ayu's solved tasks > Budi's. So if kA==0, then we require Budi to solve -1 tasks? which is impossible. So then output -1.

 4. Actually, the problem: we need to compute how many tasks Budi can solve if we pop the balloons at chosen times.

 However, note: Ayu can pop the balloons at integer minutes arbitrarily (as long as she has the balloon and the minute is in [0, M] and no two at the same minute). The popping events affect Budi's progress.

 How to model Budi's progress?
   Budi solves tasks in order. For each task i, Budi needs B_i minutes without interruption. But if a balloon pops at time t during his work on task i, then the time he has spent on that task so far is wasted and he has to restart (and the interruption time is not counted as working time). He will finish task i only when he has a contiguous B_i minutes without interruption? Actually, no: the problem says that if a balloon pops at time t, then he restarts at that moment. So the time for the task becomes: the total time from when he started the task until the interruption doesn't count? Actually, he repeats the entire task from the beginning. So the time spent on the task is reset to 0 after each pop.

 However, note: the problem states: 
   Example: 10 minutes task, pop at 7 -> then he spends 7 (wasted) and then 10 minutes (so total 17). Another pop at 13? Then at minute 7: he restarts. Then at minute 13: he has been working for 6 minutes (from 7 to 13) and then restarts again. Then he works 10 minutes without interruption? Actually, the problem says: 
      "at minute 7th (out of his 10 minutes), repeats again at minute 6th (out of his 10 minutes), and finally solved the task with 7+6+10 = 23 minutes"

 So the idea: 
   Let the start time of task i be s_i. Then he will finish at the first time t such that in the interval [s_i, t] there are no balloon pops, and the length of uninterrupted time is at least B_i? Actually, no: because if a balloon pops at time x, then the work from s_i to x is wasted, and he restarts at x. Then from x, he needs to work B_i minutes without interruption? But note: the problem says that if there is a pop at the moment when he would have finished, then he doesn't solve the task? Actually, the problem says: if a balloon pops at the same time Budi is supposed to solve (at the 10th minute in the example) then he doesn't solve and has to spend another 10 minutes.

 Actually, the problem states: 
   "if a balloon pops at the same time Budi supposed to solve the task (i.e. at the 10th minute in this example), then Budi will also not solve that task. Therefore, Budi has to spend another 10 minutes (for a total of 10+10=20 minutes) to solve that particular task in this case."

 So the rule: 
   Budi starts a task at time s. He will complete the task at the first time t such that the segment [s, t] has no balloon pop and the length of the segment is at least B_i? Actually, no: because if there is a pop at time x, then the work from s to x is wasted and he restarts at x. Then from x, he again needs to work B_i minutes without interruption? Actually, the problem doesn't require the work to be contiguous? But note: the problem says "repeat the task", meaning he starts from scratch.

 How to compute the time for Budi to finish a task i given a set of balloon pops? 
   We can model: 
      Let the balloon pops that occur during his work on task i be at times: p1, p2, ... , pk (in increasing order) and they occur during the interval [s_i, ...]. Then the time he spends on the task is:
          (p1 - s_i)   -> wasted, then restart at p1.
          (p2 - p1)    -> wasted, then restart at p2.
          ...
          (t - pk)     -> this last segment must be at least B_i? Actually, no: because if we have a pop at the last moment, then we don't complete. So we require that the last segment is at least B_i and without any pop? Actually, we require that the segment [pk, t] has no pop and length >= B_i? But note: the pop at pk causes a restart, and then we need B_i uninterrupted time from pk.

   So the total time for the task is: 
        (p1 - s_i) + (p2 - p1) + ... + (pk - p_{k-1}) + B_i   ??? 
        = (pk - s_i) + B_i

   However, note: if a pop occurs at time t0 = s_i + B_i, then according to the problem, the task is not solved at that moment. Then the time becomes: 
        (t0 - s_i) + B_i = (s_i+B_i - s_i) + B_i = B_i + B_i = 2*B_i.

   But wait: the above formula (pk - s_i) + B_i does not account for the fact that we might have multiple pops that do not necessarily end at the last pop? Actually, we are not including the time after the last pop. We need to have a segment of length B_i after the last pop. So the total time from s_i to the finish time is:
        (last_pop_time - s_i) + B_i   [because after the last pop, we need B_i uninterrupted minutes]

   However, consider: 
        s_i = 0, B_i = 10, and we have a pop at time 5 and time 15.
        Then: 
            from 0 to 5: wasted -> restart at 5.
            from 5 to 15: wasted (because at 15 we pop again) -> restart at 15.
            then from 15: we need 10 minutes -> finish at 25.
        Total time: 25 - 0 = 25.

        According to the formula: last_pop = 15, then (15 - 0) + 10 = 25 -> matches.

   But what if we have a pop at time 10? 
        Then: 
            from 0 to 10: wasted -> restart at 10.
            then from 10: need 10 minutes -> finish at 20.
        Total time: 20.

        Formula: (10-0)+10 = 20 -> matches.

   However, note: the problem says if a pop occurs at the moment when he would have finished (i.e., at 0+10=10) then he doesn't finish and has to restart. So the formula holds.

   Therefore, for a task i started at time s_i and with a set of pops P (that occur at times >= s_i) that are during the task, the finish time is:
        finish_i = max{ s_i + B_i,   (max{p in P such that p < finish_i} - s_i) + B_i? } 
        Actually, we don't know the finish_i a priori.

   Alternatively, we can think: 
        Let the pops that occur during the task i be p1, p2, ..., pk (sorted) such that s_i <= p1 < p2 < ... < pk < s_i + B_i + (number of pops doesn't matter until the last one)? Actually, no: the pops can occur arbitrarily.

   Actually, the finish time is: 
        Let T = s_i.
        While there is a pop at time p in the interval [T, T+B_i) (which we don't know until we set T) ... we get a recursion.

   But note: the pops are fixed and known? Actually, we are to choose the pops.

 How can we simulate Budi's progress? 
   We want to know the maximum number of tasks Budi can complete given our chosen balloon pops.

   Alternatively, we can think: we want to prevent Budi from completing as many tasks as possible. We are allowed to pop balloons only at integer minutes, and we get a balloon for each task Ayu solves.

   The goal: we want Ayu's solved tasks (kA) to be strictly greater than Budi's solved tasks (kB).

   So we require: kB < kA.

   How to compute the minimal set of pops to achieve that? 

   Steps:

   Step 1: Compute kA = the maximum k such that the prefix sum of A[0..k-1] <= M. (if no task, then kA=0)

   If kA == 0, then Ayu solves 0 tasks. Then we need 0 > kB. But kB is at least 0. So 0>0 is false. Also, if Budi solves 0? then 0>0 is false. So output -1.

   Step 2: Compute Budi's progress without any pops? 
        Without pops, Budi's finish time for task i: 
            start time for task 1: 0 -> finish at B0.
            start time for task 2: B0 -> finish at B0+B1.
            ... 
            prefix sum of B: let P_B[i] = B0+B1+...+B_{i-1}
        Then kB0 = max{ k: P_B[k] <= M }.

        Then without any pops, Budi solves kB0. Then we require kB0 < kA. If this holds, then we don't need to pop any balloon -> output 0.

   But we can use pops to delay Budi so that he solves fewer tasks.

   How do we use the balloons? We have kA balloons. We can choose to pop at most kA balloons at distinct integer minutes in [0, M].

   How do we compute the minimal number of pops to make Budi solve at most (kA-1) tasks? Or we don't care about the minimal number? We can output any configuration.

   Actually, we are free to choose any set of pops (with at most kA pops) that will cause Budi to solve at most (kA-1) tasks.

   How to compute the effect of a set of pops on Budi?

   We note:

        Budi starts task i at time s_i. The finish time for task i is: 
          f_i = s_i + B_i + (if there is any pop in [s_i, s_i+B_i), then we have to account for the pops? Actually, no: the formula above is: 
          f_i = (the last pop that occurs during [s_i, f_i) ) is not known in advance, but note: the pops are chosen arbitrarily.

        Actually, the effect of a pop at time p: 
          It will affect any task i that is being worked on at time p? Specifically, if s_i <= p < f_i, then it will cause the task to restart at p, so the finish time becomes at least p+B_i.

        But note: if multiple pops occur during the same task, then the last pop is the one that matters? Actually, no: each pop causes a restart. However, the formula: 
          f_i = (the last pop that occurs during the entire time from s_i to f_i) + B_i.

        Why? Because after the last pop at time p, we need B_i uninterrupted minutes. So f_i = p + B_i. But note: we don't know p until we know the pops that occur during the task.

        However, we can simulate Budi's progress with a greedy: 
          Let s_i = the start time of task i (which is the finish time of task i-1, or 0 for the first task).
          Then we consider all the pops in the interval [s_i, M]? Actually, we care only about pops that occur during [s_i, ...]. 

          We can define:
              Let T = s_i.
              We then look for the next pop at time p >= T and p < T+B_i. If there is one, then the task restarts at p: then we set T = p, and we then look again for the next pop in [T, T+B_i). We repeat until there is no pop in [T, T+B_i). Then the finish time is T+B_i.

        This simulation is O(kB * (#pops during the task)) which can be too slow if we simulate for each task and we have many pops.

   Alternative: we note that the effect of a pop at time p can be to delay the entire schedule of Budi by at least (p - s_i) for the current task? Actually, it forces the task to restart at p, so the time spent from s_i to p is wasted. Then the finish time becomes at least p+B_i. Then the next task starts at p+B_i.

   Actually, we can compute the finish time for task i as:
        Let s_i = (finish time of task i-1) or 0 for i=0.
        Then, we can define:
            f_i = s_i + B_i
            But if there is any pop in [s_i, f_i), then we need to set f_i = (max pop in [s_i, f_i)) + B_i? 
            However, consider: if there are multiple pops, then the last pop is the one that matters? Actually, yes: because after the last pop at p, we need B_i minutes. So the finish time is p+B_i. But note: what if there is another pop at p' in [p, p+B_i)? Then we have to set f_i = p' + B_i. So we have to consider the entire set of pops in [s_i, f_i) and then the last one sets the restart and then we need to check again? 

        Actually, we can use a while loop: 
            while there exists a pop in [s_i, s_i+B_i]? 
            But note: the pop at s_i+B_i causes a restart? Actually, the pop at time t = s_i+B_i is at the moment when Budi would finish, so it causes the task to be not finished and then we need to restart at t and then we need B_i minutes from t. Then the finish time becomes t+B_i = s_i+B_i+B_i.

        However, we don't know the pops arbitrarily? Actually, we are designing the pops.

   This becomes complex.

   Insight: We want to know: is there a set of pops (at most kA) such that Budi solves at most (kA-1) tasks? 

   How can we check? 

   We can try to simulate Budi's progress with a greedy algorithm that uses a set of chosen pops. But we are free to choose the pops arbitrarily? 

   Alternatively, we can think: 
        We have kA balloons. We can assign each pop to a particular task of Budi? However, a pop at time p can affect multiple tasks? Actually, it can only affect the task that is being worked on at time p.

   Therefore, we can assign a pop to a specific task of Budi? Then, the effect on task i: if we assign k_i pops to task i, then the finish time of task i becomes: 
        Let the pops assigned to task i be p_1, p_2, ... , p_{k_i} (sorted). Then the finish time for task i is: 
            f_i = max( s_i + B_i,   p_1 + B_i, p_2 + B_i, ... , p_{k_i} + B_i )? 
        Actually, no: because the pops must occur during the work of the task. So the first pop must be in [s_i, f_i) but then after the pop, the task restarts and then the next pop must be in [p_1, p_1+B_i), etc. 

        Actually, we can model: 
            Without any pop, the task finishes at s_i + B_i.
            With one pop at time p (>=s_i and <= s_i+B_i-1? or even at s_i+B_i? note the problem: if at the finishing minute, then it causes failure) -> then the finish time becomes p+B_i.

            With two pops: the first at p1 and then the second at p2 (>=p1 and <= p1+B_i) -> then the finish time becomes p2+B_i.

        Therefore, if we assign k_i pops to task i, then the finish time is: 
            f_i = (the last pop assigned to task i) + B_i.

        But note: the last pop must occur before the finish time that we are going to set? Actually, we can only assign a pop to task i if the pop occurs during the time the task is being worked on? 

        The work on task i starts at s_i. Without any pop, the finish time is s_i+B_i. Then if we put a pop at time p (with s_i <= p <= s_i+B_i-1), then the finish time becomes p+B_i. Then the next task starts at p+B_i. Now, if we want to assign another pop to task i, it must be in the interval [s_i, p+B_i) but actually, after the pop at p, the task restarts at p, so the next pop must be in [p, p+B_i). Then the finish time becomes p2+B_i, and so on.

        Therefore, the condition for a set of pops assigned to task i (p1, p2, ... , p_{k_i}) is:
            s_i <= p1 < p2 < ... < p_{k_i} < s_i + (B_i) * (k_i) ??? 

        Actually, no: 
            The first pop must be in [s_i, s_i+B_i) -> p1 < s_i+B_i.
            Then the second pop must be in [p1, p1+B_i) -> p2 < p1+B_i < s_i+B_i+B_i = s_i+2*B_i.
            The third pop must be in [p2, p2+B_i) -> p3 < p2+B_i < p1+2*B_i < s_i+3*B_i.

        So the last pop p_{k_i} < s_i + k_i * B_i.

        Then the finish time is p_{k_i} + B_i.

        And the condition for the pops is that they must be increasing and the last pop must be less than s_i + k_i * B_i.

        But note: the start time of the next task is f_i = p_{k_i} + B_i.

        Therefore, if we assign k_i pops to task i, then the next task starts at: 
            s_{i+1} = f_i = p_{k_i} + B_i.

        And we must have p_{k_i} < s_i + k_i * B_i.

        Also, the pops must be at integer minutes and distinct.

        However, we are free to choose the pops arbitrarily? Then we can choose the pops for task i as late as possible to maximize the delay? Actually, we want to delay Budi as much as possible? But we don't care about the exact time as long as we make him complete at most kA-1 tasks.

        How to assign pops to tasks? 

        We want to prevent Budi from completing the first kA tasks? Because if he completes kA tasks, then Ayu's solved tasks (kA) is not strictly greater than Budi's (kA). So we need Budi to complete at most kA-1 tasks.

        Therefore, we must make sure that Budi does not complete the kA-th task? 

        How? We need the finish time of the first kA tasks by Budi to exceed M.

        Let F_i = the finish time of task i.

        We have:
            F_0 = (if we assign k0 pops to task0) = (last pop for task0) + B0, provided that the last pop < F0_prev = (initially s0=0) then 0 + k0 * B0? Actually, the condition is that the last pop must be < 0 + k0 * B0? Then F0 = last_pop + B0.

        Then F1 = last_pop1 + B1, and the last_pop1 must be < F0 + k1 * B1.

        We want F_{kA-1} > M? Actually, we want that the start time of the kA-th task (which is F_{kA-1}) plus the time to complete that task (with pops) must exceed M? Actually, we don't care about the kA-th task if we can prevent the (kA-1)-th task from finishing? Actually, we count the number of tasks: if the first kA tasks of Budi are not completed, then he completes at most kA-1.

        Actually, we require that the finish time of the j-th task (for j from 0 to kA-1) does not exceed M? Then he completes j tasks. We require that the finish time of the (kA-1)-th task is <= M? Then he completes kA-1 tasks? Actually, no: we require that he does not complete the kA-th task? Actually, we require that he completes at most kA-1 tasks. That means the kA-th task must not be completed? So the first task that he fails must be the kA-th? Actually, no: he might fail at an earlier task. But we want to minimize the number of pops? Actually, we don't care about the number of pops as long as we use at most kA.

        Actually, we can try to maximize the delay for Budi so that the total time for the first kA tasks of Budi exceeds M.

        We want: 
            F_{kA-1} > M   (if we index from 0 to kA-1, then the first kA tasks) -> then Budi completes at most kA-1 tasks.

        How to assign pops to the tasks? 

        We are allowed at most kA pops. We can assign at most k_i pops to task i (with sum k_i <= kA).

        The recurrence:
            F_0 = (if we assign k0 pops to task0) = we can choose the last pop arbitrarily as long as it is < 0 + k0 * B0? and then F0 = last_pop + B0.

            To maximize F0, we set the last pop as late as possible: at min(M, 0 + k0*B0 - 1) [because it must be < 0+k0*B0]? Actually, we want to maximize F0 = last_pop + B0, so we set last_pop = min(M, k0*B0 - 1) but note: the pop must be at an integer minute and we cannot exceed M. Also, we have to consider that we might have multiple pops: we can set all pops arbitrarily as long as they are increasing and the last one is as late as possible.

            Actually, to maximize F0, we set the last pop at p0 = min(M, k0*B0 - 1). Then F0 = p0 + B0.

            Then for task1: 
                We can assign k1 pops. The condition: the pops for task1 must be in the interval [F0, F0 + k1*B1) (because the start time is F0). Then the last pop p1 must be < F0 + k1*B1, and F1 = p1 + B1.

            We set p1 = min(M, F0 + k1*B1 - 1). Then F1 = p1 + B1.

            Then we do for i=0 to kA-1.

        We want F_{kA-1} > M.

        But note: we are constrained by the total number of pops: k0+k1+...+k_{kA-1} <= kA.

        How to assign the k_i? We want to maximize the finish time F_{kA-1}. We can use dynamic programming? But kA can be up to 100000.

        Alternatively, we can use a greedy: assign as many pops as possible to the first tasks? Actually, we want the finish time of the last task (kA-1) to be as delayed as possible.

        Note: the effect of one pop on task i: it can delay the finish time of task i by at most (B_i - 1) [if we put the pop at the last possible moment: s_i + B_i - 1, then the finish time becomes (s_i+B_i-1)+B_i = s_i+2*B_i-1, which is an extra delay of B_i-1]. Then if we assign k_i pops, the maximum finish time for task i is: 
            F_i = s_i + (k_i+1)*B_i - 1   ??? 
            Actually: 
               Without pop: F_i = s_i+B_i.
               With one pop: we set the pop at s_i+B_i-1 -> then F_i = (s_i+B_i-1) + B_i = s_i+2*B_i-1.
               With two pops: the last pop at (s_i+2*B_i-1) -> then F_i = (s_i+2*B_i-1)+B_i = s_i+3*B_i-1.

            So with k_i pops: F_i = s_i + (k_i+1)*B_i - 1.

        However, we cannot set the pop at s_i+B_i-1 if s_i+B_i-1 > M? Then we set at M? But then the finish time becomes M+B_i? which might be very large.

        Actually, we are constrained by M: we can set a pop at any integer minute in [0, M]. So the last pop for task i must be at most M. Therefore, the maximum F_i we can get for task i is: 
            F_i = min( s_i + (k_i+1)*B_i - 1,  M ) + B_i   ??? 

        Actually, the formula for the last pop: 
            p_i = min( M, s_i + k_i * B_i - 1 )   [because the last pop must be < s_i + k_i * B_i, so the maximum is s_i + k_i * B_i - 1, or M if that is smaller]

        Then F_i = p_i + B_i.

        Then the next task starts at F_i.

        Now, we want to assign nonnegative integers k0, k1, ... , k_{kA-1} such that:
            k0+k1+...+k_{kA-1} <= kA   (the total pops we have)
            and F_{kA-1} > M.

        How to compute F_i? 
            F_{-1} = 0.
            For i from 0 to kA-1:
                F_i = min( M, F_{i-1} + k_i * B_i ) + B_i   ??? 

            Actually: 
                The start time for task i is F_{i-1} (if we define F_{-1}=0).
                Then the last pop for task i must be at: p_i = min( M, F_{i-1} + k_i * B_i - 1 )
                Then F_i = p_i + B_i.

        Then we want F_{kA-1} > M.

        We have to choose k_i for each task i (0<=i<kA) such that the total k_i <= kA and F_{kA-1}>M.

        How to assign the k_i? We want to minimize the total k_i? Actually, we don't care about the total k_i as long as it is <= kA. We are free to choose any assignment.

        We can use a greedy: assign as many pops as possible to the earliest tasks? Or to the tasks with the largest B_i? 

        Alternatively, we can try to see if it is possible at all: 

            We can use a binary search on the total number of pops? Actually, we are constrained by the total pops <= kA.

            We can try to simulate the schedule with a fixed assignment of k_i. How to assign optimally? 

            Note: the effect of a pop in task i: 
                It adds at least B_i to the finish time? Actually, the minimal effect of one pop on task i is: if we put the pop at the start time s_i, then F_i becomes s_i + B_i (same as without pop) -> no effect? Then we have to put the pop as late as possible to maximize the delay.

            Actually, to maximize the finish time of the entire set of kA tasks, we want to assign the pops as follows:

                We want to maximize F_{kA-1}. How? 
                    We can use a greedy backward: 
                      For the last task (kA-1): the more pops we assign to it, the more we delay it. But we also have to account for the start time of this task (which is F_{kA-2}).

                Alternatively, we can use a greedy: assign one pop at a time and see which task gives the maximal increase in the overall finish time.

            However, note: the effect of one pop in task i: 
                Without the pop, the finish time of task i is F_{i-1} + B_i.
                With one pop (placed optimally at the last moment): the finish time becomes min(M, F_{i-1} + B_i - 1) + B_i? Actually, no: with one pop, the last pop must be < F_{i-1}+B_i, so we set at F_{i-1}+B_i-1, then F_i = F_{i-1}+B_i-1+B_i = F_{i-1} + 2*B_i - 1.

                The increase is: (F_{i-1}+2*B_i-1) - (F_{i-1}+B_i) = B_i-1.

            Therefore, the effect of one pop on task i is to increase the finish time by (B_i - 1) (if we can set the pop at the last moment without hitting M). But if we hit M, then the effect is: 
                Without pop: F_i = F_{i-1}+B_i.
                With pop: we set the pop at M (if F_{i-1}+B_i-1 >= M, then we set at M) -> then F_i = M+B_i.

                The increase: M+B_i - (F_{i-1}+B_i) = M - F_{i-1}.

            So the effect is min(B_i-1, M - (F_{i-1}+B_i))? Actually, the condition for hitting M: if F_{i-1}+B_i-1 >= M, then we set pop at M -> then F_i = M+B_i, and the increase is M - F_{i-1} (because without pop: F_i = F_{i-1}+B_i, so the increase = (M+B_i) - (F_{i-1}+B_i) = M - F_{i-1}).

            Actually, the increase is: 
                If F_{i-1} + B_i - 1 < M: then the new F_i = F_{i-1} + 2*B_i - 1, so the increase is (F_{i-1}+2*B_i-1) - (F_{i-1}+B_i) = B_i-1.
                Else: then we set the pop at M -> then F_i = M+B_i, and the increase = (M+B_i) - (F_{i-1}+B_i) = M - F_{i-1}.

            However, note: without the pop, the task i would have finished at F_{i-1}+B_i, but if F_{i-1}+B_i > M, then without pop the task is not finished? Actually, no: without pop, the task i finishes at F_{i-1}+B_i, and if F_{i-1}+B_i <= M, then it is finished. If F_{i-1}+B_i > M, then without pop the task is not finished? Then why would we assign a pop? Actually, if the task is not finished without pop, then we don't need to pop? But note: we are trying to maximize the finish time? Actually, we are trying to make the entire schedule take as long as possible so that the first kA tasks exceed M.

            Actually, we require that the schedule of Budi for the first kA tasks exceeds M. 

            How about we simulate without any pop: 
                Let F0 = B0
                F1 = F0+B1
                ...
                F_i = F_{i-1}+B_i.

            If F_{kA-1} > M, then we are done: we don't need any pop? But wait: if F_{kA-1}>M, then Budi doesn't complete the kA-th task? Actually, he completes the first kA-1 tasks? And the kA-th task is not completed? Then kB = kA-1, and Ayu has kA > kB -> we win with 0 pops.

            Therefore, we only need to use pops if without any pop, F_{kA-1} <= M.

            Then we have to assign pops to make F_{kA-1} > M.

            The effect of one pop: we can choose which task i to put the pop. And the effect is: 
                If at task i, the current F_{i-1} is such that F_{i-1} + B_i - 1 < M, then the increase is B_i-1.
                Else, the increase is M - F_{i-1}.

            We want to maximize the final F_{kA-1}. We have a total of kA pops (but we don't have to use all). How to assign the pops to maximize the final F?

            We can use a priority queue: 
                Initially, simulate without pops: 
                    F[0] = B0
                    F[1] = F[0]+B1
                    ... 
                    F[i] = F[i-1]+B_i, for i=0 to kA-1.

                If F[kA-1] > M, then we output 0.

                Otherwise, we have some pops to assign. We consider the effect of adding one pop to each task. The effect on task i: 
                    increase_i = min(B_i-1, M - (F_{i-1}+B_i))? Actually, without the pop, the task i finishes at F_i = F_{i-1}+B_i. When we add a pop, then the finish time becomes: 
                         if F_{i-1}+B_i-1 < M: then F_i becomes F_{i-1}+2*B_i-1 -> so the increase is (F_{i-1}+2*B_i-1) - (F_{i-1}+B_i) = B_i-1.
                         else: we set the pop at M -> then F_i becomes M+B_i -> the increase is M - (F_{i-1}+B_i) + B_i? Actually, the increase in F_i is: M+B_i - (F_{i-1}+B_i) = M - F_{i-1}.

                But note: this pop also affects the subsequent tasks? Because the start time of the next task is increased by the same amount.

                Actually, we have to update the entire schedule. However, we are allowed to assign multiple pops? And we want to assign at most kA pops.

            Alternatively, we can try to simulate the schedule with pops by iterating the tasks and greedily assign pops to the task that gives the maximal increase per pop? But note: the increase is not independent because the start time of the next tasks change.

            We can use a greedy: 
                We maintain the current finish time for each task if we have applied some pops so far. 
                We start with F_i = the original prefix sum.

                Then, we consider: we have kA pops to assign (but we don't need to use all, we stop once F_{kA-1}>M). We want to use as few pops as possible.

                We can try to assign one pop at a time, and choose the task that gives the maximum immediate increase in the finish time of that task, which then propagates to the subsequent tasks.

                Specifically, for a task i, if we assign an additional pop, then the new finish time of task i becomes:
                   newF_i = min(M, current_start_i + (current_k_i+1)*B_i - 1) + B_i 
                   but note: current_start_i might have been increased by pops on previous tasks and also by pops we have already assigned to this task.

                Alternatively, we can maintain an array F[0..kA-1] for the current finish times.

                Steps:
                  F[0..kA-1] = prefix sums: F0 = B0, F1 = B0+B1, ... 
                  Let k[0..kA-1] = 0 for each task.

                  Then, for pop_count from 1 to kA (and while F[kA-1] <= M):
                      For each task i, we compute the potential new F_i if we add one pop to task i: 
                         The start time of task i is F[i-1] (if i>0) or 0 for i=0.
                         With k_i already assigned, the current condition: the last pop we can assign for task i would be at: 
                             p = min(M, start_i + (k_i+1)*B_i - 1)
                         Then the new finish time for task i would be: p + B_i.

                         Then the new schedule for tasks i, i+1, ... would be: 
                             newF_i = p+B_i
                             then for task i+1: the start time becomes newF_i, so the finish time of task i+1 would be: 
                                 newF_{i+1} = newF_i + B_{i+1]? But wait, we have not assigned pops to task i+1? Actually, we are only considering one pop at task i, and the pops for other tasks remain as before? 

                         But note: the pops we have already assigned to tasks after i were chosen based on the old start times. So we cannot simply update one task.

                  This becomes too heavy: O(kA^2).

            Another idea: we note that we are only interested in the final F_{kA-1}. And we are allowed to assign any number of pops to each task. The finish time of the last task is:

                F_{kA-1} = B_{kA-1} + min( M, F_{kA-2} + k_{kA-1} * B_{kA-1} - 1 )   ??? 

                Actually, it's recursive.

            Actually, we can use dynamic programming: 
                dp[i][j] = the minimal possible finish time for the first i tasks using j pops. 
                But i up to 100000, j up to 100000 -> 10e10 states.

            Alternative: we try to see if there exists an assignment of pops (k0, k1, ...) with total pops <= kA such that F_{kA-1} > M.

            We can try a binary search on the number of pops? Actually, we are not minimizing the pops, we are just checking feasibility.

            Or we can greedily assign pops from the last task backward? 

            Insight: 
                To delay the finish time of the entire set of kA tasks as much as possible, we should use the pops on the later tasks? Because the pops on later tasks have a compounding effect? 

            Example: 
                Suppose we have two tasks: 
                    Task0: B0 = 10
                    Task1: B1 = 10
                M = 25.

                Without pops: 
                    F0 = 10, F1 = 20 -> Budi completes both tasks.

                If we assign one pop to task0: 
                    Then F0 = min(M, 0+1*10-1)+10 = min(25,9)+10 = 19.
                    Then F1 = 19+10 = 29 -> >25, so Budi completes only task0.

                If we assign one pop to task1:
                    Start task1 at 10.
                    Then F1 = min(25,10+1*10-1)+10 = min(25,19)+10 = 29.

                Both work. But if we have two pops: 
                    We can assign one to task0 and one to task1: 
                      F0 = 9+10 = 19.
                      F1 = min(25,19+1*10-1)+10 = min(25,28)+10 = 25+10 = 35.

            How about we assign the pops in reverse order: 
                Let F = the prefix sum for the first kA tasks: F = [F0, F1, ..., F_{kA-1}]
                We want to make F_{kA-1} > M.

                We are allowed to spend up to kA pops.

                We know that without pops, F_{kA-1} = P = prefix[kA-1] (the sum of B0 to B_{kA-1}).

                If P > M, then we win with 0 pops.

                Otherwise, we consider: 
                  Let x_i be the number of pops on task i.

                  Then the finish time of task i is: 
                      f_i = (start_i + x_i * B_i) + B_i - 1   ??? -> no, we cannot arbitrarily set, we are bounded by M.

                  Actually, the finish time of task i is: 
                      f_i = min(M, start_i + x_i * B_i) + B_i   [because the last pop is at min(M, start_i+x_i*B_i) and then we add B_i]

                  But then the start of task i+1 is f_i.

                We want: f_{kA-1} > M.

                We can do a greedy from the last task to the first: 
                  For task i from kA-1 down to 0:
                      We want to choose x_i such that the overall finish time of the last task is > M.

                  How many pops are needed on task i to make the finish time of the entire schedule > M?

                  Note: the minimal finish time of task i (start_i) is known: it's the finish time of task i-1.

                  But we haven't decided the pops on tasks after i? 

                Alternatively, we can try to compute the minimal number of pops required to make the schedule exceed M.

                Let F = 0 for the start of the first task.
                We want to compute for each task i: the minimal additional pops needed to make the finish time of the last task > M, given the start time F for task i.

                But the effect of pops on task i: they can delay the start of the next task.

                We can do:

                  Let x be the number of pops we assign to task i.
                  Then the finish time of task i = f_i = min(M, F + x * B_i) + B_i.

                  Then the start time for task i+1 is f_i.

                  We then recursively compute the minimal pops needed for tasks i+1..kA-1 to make the last finish time > M, given start time = f_i.

                This is recursive and might be exponential.

            Given the complexity, there is a simpler solution:

            We note: if we assign x_i pops to task i, then the finish time of task i is:
                f_i = 
                  if F_{i-1} + x_i * B_i <= M: 
                      f_i = F_{i-1} + x_i * B_i + B_i   [because the last pop can be at F_{i-1}+x_i*B_i, which is <=M, then finish time = last pop + B_i = F_{i-1}+x_i*B_i+B_i]
                  else: 
                      f_i = M + B_i   [because the last pop must be at M]

            Therefore, we have: 
                f_i = min(F_{i-1} + x_i * B_i + B_i, M+B_i)

            Now, we want f_{kA-1} > M.

            And the total x0+x1+...+x_{kA-1} <= kA.

            How to minimize the total pops? Or just check existence.

            We can do a greedy: 
                Let current_start = 0.
                Let total_pops = 0.
                For i in range(kA): 
                    We want to choose x_i (>=0) as small as possible such that either:
                      option1: if we can make current_start + (x_i+1)*B_i > M, then the finish time f_i = M+B_i > M (which is good) and then the next tasks won't even start? But we only care that the entire schedule for the first kA tasks has the last finish time > M. Actually, we require that the finish time of the last task (kA-1) > M. But if we make task i's finish time > M, then the next tasks won't be started? Then the total tasks Budi completes is i, which is <= kA-1 (because i<kA) -> then we win.

                    Therefore, we only need to make sure that at some task i (0<=i<kA), the finish time of task i > M.

                    So we can choose, for the first task i that we can make f_i > M with the minimal number of pops.

                    Specifically, for task i, the minimal x_i such that f_i > M is:
                         if current_start + B_i > M: 
                             then even without any pop, f_i = current_start+B_i > M? -> then x_i=0.
                         else if M+B_i > M (which is always true) and we need to achieve f_i = min( current_start + (x_i+1)*B_i, M+B_i ) > M.
                         This is true if either:
                             current_start + (x_i+1)*B_i > M, then we set x_i = ceil((M - current_start) / B_i)   [because x_i must be at least such that current_start + (x_i+1)*B_i > M]
                             or if we hit the M+B_i branch: but M+B_i> M is always true.

                         However, note: if we hit the M+B_i branch, then we require x_i such that current_start + x_i * B_i > M. 
                             Because then we set the last pop at M, so finish time = M+B_i> M.

                         So the minimal x_i is the minimal integer such that either:
                             current_start + (x_i+1)*B_i > M   OR   current_start + x_i * B_i > M.

                         But note: 
                             current_start + (x_i+1)*B_i > M   -> x_i+1 > (M - current_start) / B_i   -> x_i >= ceil((M - current_start) / B_i) 
                             and 
                             current_start + x_i * B_i > M   -> x_i > (M - current_start) / B_i   -> x_i >= floor((M - current_start) / B_i) + 1 = ceil((M - current_start+1) / B_i) 

                         But wait: the condition for using the branch M+B_i is: if during the task we hit M, i.e., if we have to set the last pop at M. That happens if the pops would naturally extend beyond M? 

                         Actually, the finish time is:
                             f_i = min( current_start + (x_i+1)*B_i, M+B_i )

                         We want f_i > M.

                         This is always true if M+B_i > M (which is true) and current_start + (x_i+1)*B_i > M.

                         OR if we choose x_i such that current_start + x_i * B_i > M, then we get f_i = M+B_i > M.

                         So the condition is: 
                             current_start + (x_i+1)*B_i > M   OR   current_start + x_i * B_i > M.

                         The second condition is weaker: because if current_start + x_i * B_i > M, then current_start + (x_i+1)*B_i > M also holds.

                         So we only require: current_start + x_i * B_i > M.

                         Therefore, the minimal x_i = floor((M - current_start) / B_i) + 1   [because if (M - current_start) is divisible by B_i, then we need x_i = (M - current_start)/B_i + 1?]

                         Example: current_start=0, M=10, B_i=5: 
                             floor(10/5)=2, then x_i=2+1=3? 
                             But: 
                                 x_i=2: 0+2*5=10 -> not >10 -> fails.
                                 x_i=3: 0+3*5=15>10 -> works.

                         So minimal x_i = floor((M - current_start) / B_i) + 1.

                    Then if total_pops + x_i <= kA, then we can win by using x_i pops on task i and not touch the later tasks (because task i alone will finish after M, so the next tasks won't be done).

                    If for task i, we can do it within the total pops, then we output a plan.

                    If we cannot, then we update the current_start for the next task: 
                         We choose to use x_i = 0 for this task? But then we might not exceed M at task i. Then we have to simulate with x_i=0.

                         Actually, we have to choose how many pops to use on task i. We might want to save pops for later. 

                    But note: our goal is to make sure that the entire schedule of the first kA tasks finishes after M. We can achieve that by making any task i (0<=i<kA) finish after M.

                    Therefore, we can try for each task i: 
                         x_i = minimal integer such that current_start_i + x_i * B_i > M.
                         if the total pops used up to task i (which is the sum of pops we've used in tasks 0..i-1, plus x_i) <= kA, then we win.

                    But how many pops have we used in tasks 0..i-1? We haven't decided. 

                    Alternatively, we can try to find the minimal pops overall to make at least one task finish after M. 

                    For task i, the minimal pops needed is x_i = floor((M - current_start_i) / B_i) + 1, where current_start_i is the start time of task i without any pops on task i, but with pops on previous tasks? 

                    How to compute current_start_i? 
                         current_start_i = prefix_i = B0+B1+...+B_{i-1}

                    Because we haven't used any pops yet on any task, and we are only using pops on task i to make it exceed M.

                    Then the total pops needed is x_i.

                    And if there exists an i in [0, kA-1] such that x_i <= kA, then we win.

                    But wait: if we use pops on previous tasks, we might have made the start time of task i later, and then we might need fewer pops on task i? 

                    Example: 
                         Task0: B0=10, Task1: B1=10, M=25.
                         Without pops on task0: start0=0, then for task0: x0 = floor((25-0)/10)+1 = 2+1=3.
                         For task1: start1=10, then x1 = floor((25-10)/10)+1 = 1+1=2.

                         But if we use one pop on task0: then the finish time of task0 becomes: 
                             last pop at min(M,0+1*10-1)=9, then finish0=9+10=19.
                             then for task1: start1=19, then x1 = floor((25-19)/10)+1 = 0+1=1.
                         Then total pops = 1 (on task0) + 1 (on task1) = 2.

                         Or if we use two pops on task0: then finish0 = 0+2*10+10-1? -> wait, our minimal pops for task0 to exceed M is 3. But with two pops on task0: 
                             last pop at min(25,0+2*10-1)=19, then finish0=19+10=29>25 -> then we only need two pops on task0.

                         So the minimal pops for task0 is 2: because floor((25-0)/10)+1 gives 3, but actually we can do with 2.

                    Why the discrepancy? 
                         Our formula for task0: 
                             We require: current_start0 + x0 * B0 > M   -> 0 + x0*10>25 -> x0>=3.

                         But with two pops: the finish time is 0+2*10-1+10 = 29>25, but this is not captured by the condition current_start0+x0*B0>25? 
                             The condition we used for the branch: we are in the branch where we don't hit M in the pops? 

                         How does the finish time become 29? 
                             Because we are in the branch: current_start0 + (x0+1)*B0 = 0+3*10 = 30>25, so we hit the other branch: f0 = M+B0 = 25+10=35? 
                             But wait, with two pops: 
                                 last pop = min(25,0+2*10-1)=19, then f0=19+10=29.

                         So the formula for f0 is: 
                             f0 = min(0+3*10, 25+10) = 35?  -> no, we used two pops.

                         The finish time is not computed by the formula: current_start0+x0*B0+B0, but by: last_pop = min(25, current_start0+x0*B0-1) and then f0=last_pop+B0.

                         So the condition to have f0>25 is: last_pop+B0>25.
                         last_pop = min(25, current_start0+x0*B0-1) = min(25, x0*10-1)
                         then f0 = min(25, x0*10-1) + 10.

                         We want: min(25, x0*10-1)+10 > 25.

                         If x0*10-1 >=25, then f0=25+10=35>25.
                         If x0*10-1 <25, then f0 = (x0*10-1)+10 = x0*10+9.

                         So we require: either 
                            x0*10+9 > 25  -> x0*10>16 -> x0>=2 (since x0 integer) 
                            or the other branch: x0>= ceil(26/10)=3.

                         So the minimal x0 is 2.

                    Therefore, the formula for the minimal x_i for task i is more complex.

            Given the complexity of computing the minimal number of pops per task, and the fact that we have the freedom to choose the exact times, there is a known solution from known problems:

            We can solve by: 
               1. Compute kA = maximum tasks Ayu can solve.
               2. If kA==0, then output -1.
               3. Compute the prefix sums for Budi: P[0..kA-1] for the first kA tasks.
               4. If P[kA-1] > M, then output 0.

               5. Otherwise, we want to assign some pops. We note that we only need to make one task exceed M. So we can iterate i from 0 to kA-1 and try to see if we can make task i finish after M using at most (some number) of pops, and the total pops used is at most kA.

               How to compute the minimal number of pops needed for task i? 
                  Let s = prefix[i] - B_i   [start time of task i, because prefix[i] = P_i = finish time without any pop for task i]
                  We then need to choose an integer x>=0 such that there exists an increasing sequence of integers (p1, p2, ..., px) with:
                      s <= p1 < p2 < ... < px < s + x * B_i   [from the condition: the last pop must be < s+x*B_i]
                  and then the finish time is f_i = px + B_i > M.

                  We can choose the pops optimally: to use as few pops as possible, we should set the pops as late as possible.

                  The minimal x such that we can have f_i>M is the minimal x such that:
                      There exists an integer px in [s, s+x*B_i) and px + B_i > M.

                  -> px > M - B_i.

                  So we require that the interval (M-B_i, s+x*B_i) is nonempty? 
                  -> M-B_i < s+x*B_i.

                  -> x > (M-B_i - s) / B_i.

                  -> x >= floor((M-B_i-s) / B_i) + 1   if (M-B_i-s) is not negative? 

                  But note: if M-B_i < s, then any x>=0 works: because then we can choose a pop at any point in [s, s+x*B_i) and then f_i = px+B_i >= s+B_i = prefix[i] (which might be<=M) -> wait, but we require >M.

                  Actually, if M-B_i < s, then px+B_i >= s+B_i = prefix[i] (which is the finish time without pops) and we know prefix[i] <= M (because we are in the case where the whole schedule for the first kA tasks is <=M). So we require pops to make it >M.

                  How? 
                      We need px > M-B_i, and since M-B_i < s, then px must be >= s. So we require that there exists an integer px in [max(s, floor(M-B_i)+1), s+x*B_i).

                  The interval [max(s, floor(M-B_i)+1), s+x*B_i) exists if:
                         floor(M-B_i)+1 < s+x*B_i.

                  -> x > (floor(M-B_i)+1 - s) / B_i.

                  Therefore, the minimal x is the smallest integer such that:
                         s + x * B_i > floor(M-B_i)   [which is equivalent to s+x*B_i > M-B_i] and also 
                         s+x*B_i > floor(M-B_i)+1 is the same condition.

                  wait floor(M-B_i) is not used, we can simply: 
                         x > (M-B_i - s) / B_i.

                  -> x = floor( (M-B_i - s) / B_i ) + 1, if (M-B_i-s)>=0.
                  if (M-B_i-s)<0, then x=0 might work? 

                  Let's test: 
                      s=0, B_i=10, M=25: 
                         M-B_i-s = 15, then x = floor(15/10)+1 = 1+1=2. -> which is the sample.

                  s= prefix[i]-B_i = (0 for the first task) - wait, for the first task: prefix[0]=B0, so s=0.

                  But what if we have a later task: 
                      task1: s = prefix[0] = B0.
                      M=25, B0=10, then for task1: s=10, B_i=10.
                      M-B_i-s = 25-10-10=5.
                      x = floor(5/10)+1 = 0+1=1.

                  And indeed, we can use one pop: 
                      choose p1 in [10, 10+1*10)= [10,20) and then f_i = p1+10. We want p1+10>25 -> p1>15. 
                      p1 can be 16, then f_i=26>25.

                  But what if the minimal x=1, then we need to check if there is an integer in (15, 20) -> yes, 16.

                  Formula: x = floor((M-B_i-s) / B_i) + 1.

                  However, if (M-B_i-s) is negative, then floor((M-B_i-s)/B_i) is negative, then x = floor(...)+1 might be 0 or negative.

                  If (M-B_i-s) < 0, then we have: 
                         s > M-B_i.
                         -> s + B_i > M.
                         -> the finish time without any pop is s+B_i = prefix[i] > M.
                         -> then we don't need any pop.

                  So x=0 works.

                  Therefore, the minimal x_i = 
                         if prefix[i] > M: x_i=0.
                         else: x_i = floor((M - B_i - s) / B_i) + 1, where s = prefix[i] - B_i.

                  But note: s = prefix[i] - B_i = (for task i: the sum of B0..B_{i-1]).
                  Then M-B_i-s = M - B_i - (prefix[i]-B_i) = M - prefix[i].

                  Therefore, x_i = floor((M - prefix[i]) / B_i) + 1.

                  Let's test: 
                      task0: prefix[0]=B0, then x0 = floor((M-B0)/B0)+1.
                      task1: prefix[1]=B0+B1, then x1 = floor((M - (B0+B1)) / B1) + 1.

                  Example: 
                      Sample1: 
                         N=4, M=30, 
                         A = [9,10,10,10] -> kA: 
                             task0:9, task1:9+10=19, task2:29, task3:39>30 -> kA=3.
                         B = [4,10,5,10] 
                         prefix for Budi for the first 3 tasks: 
                             prefix0 = 4
                             prefix1 = 4+10=14
                             prefix2 = 14+5=19
                         For task0: x0 = floor((30-4)/4)+1 = floor(26/4)=6.5 -> floor=6 -> 6+1=7.
                         For task1: x1 = floor((30-14)/10)+1 = floor(16/10)=1 -> 1+1=2.
                         For task2: x2 = floor((30-19)/5)+1 = floor(11/5)=2 -> 2+1=3.

                         The minimal x_i is 2 (for task1). And 2<=kA (which is 3) -> then we can win by using 2 pops on task1.

                  Therefore, we output a configuration with 2 pops on task1.

                  How to generate the actual pops for task1? 
                         Task1: 
                            start time = prefix0 = 4.
                            We need 2 pops: the last pop must be < 4 + 2*10 = 24.
                            And we want the last pop to be as late as possible to ensure the finish time>M? 
                                finish time = last_pop + B_i = last_pop+10.
                            We want finish time>30, so last_pop>20.
                            So we choose two pops at minutes: we can choose any two distinct integers in [4,24) with one of them in (20,24). 
                            For example: 21 and 22.

                         But the sample output is "2" and then "12 19".

                  Why in the sample output they used 12 and 19? 
                         In the sample input, Ayu solved 3 tasks: 
                             Ayu: 
                                 task0: at 9 -> balloon1 available.
                                 task1: at 9+10=19 -> balloon2 available.
                                 task2: at 19+10=29 -> balloon3 available.

                         Budi: 
                             task0: finishes at 4.
                             task1: starts at 4. 
                                 At minute 12: Ayu pops a balloon (she has one from task0) -> so at minute 12, Budi restarts task1.
                                 Then at minute 19: Ayu pops another balloon (she has two: from task0 and task1) -> Budi restarts again.
                             Then task1 finishes at 19+10=29.

                         Then Budi starts task2 at 29, and has to work 5 minutes -> 34>30, so not finished.

                         So Budi solved 1 task? Actually, he solved task0 and task1? 
                             task0: at 4 -> solved.
                             task1: at 29 -> solved? because the contest ends at 30, and 29<=30 -> solved.

                         Then Budi solved 2 tasks, and Ayu solved 3.

                         Why task1 is solved? 
                             The balloon pop at 19: then Budi restarts at 19 and then works 10 minutes -> finishes at 29, which is <=30.

                         But we wanted to make task1 finish after 30? 

                         The sample output does not make task1 exceed 30. It makes task2 not start? 

                         How many tasks does Budi solve in the sample? 
                             task0: yes.
                             task1: yes (at 29).
                             task2: no (started at 29, needs 5 minutes -> 34>30).

                         So Budi solved 2 tasks, and Ayu solved 3.

                         Therefore, we only need to make sure that the (kA)th task of Budi is not solved, and we don't necessarily need to make a task finish after M during its execution. We only need that the first kA tasks of Budi are not all completed. 

                         In other words, we only need that the last task of the first kA tasks (task index kA-1) is not completed.

                         How? 
                             We can either make an earlier task not completed (by making it finish after M) or make sure that the last task doesn't start early enough.

                         In the sample, we made task2 not start early enough: it started at 29 and needed 5 minutes -> 34>30.

                         So the condition is that the start time of task kA-1 plus the time to complete it (with pops) must be > M.

                         Specifically, the start time of task i for i=kA-1 is the finish time of task kA-2.

                         So we only need to make the finish time of any task i (0<=i<kA) > M, OR make the start time of task i (for i>=kA-1) such that even without pops the task i won't finish by M.

                         But note: if we make an earlier task i finish after M, then the subsequent tasks are not even started.

                         In the sample, we didn't make any task finish after M, but we delayed task1 so much that task2 started too late.

                         Therefore, the condition is: the finish time of task i being > M for some i<kA, OR the start time of task i (for i such that the task i is the last task or any task) plus the time to do it (with any pops) > M.

                         Actually, we require that the number of tasks Budi completes is at most kA-1. This happens if the start time of task kA-1 is > M, or if the start time is <=M but with pops the task finish time > M.

                         But if the start time of task kA-1 is > M, then the task is not even started? and then not completed.

                         So we win.

                  Therefore, we can try to prevent task i from being completed for any i in [0, kA-1] by either:
                      - making the finish time of task i > M, or 
                      - making the start time of task i > M (then it's not even started).

                  But the start time of task i is the finish time of task i-1. So if we make the finish time of task i-1 > M, then task i is not started.

                  So essentially, we only need to make the finish time of any task i in [0, kA-1] > M.

                  How to compute the minimal number of pops to make the finish time of task i > M? 
                         s_i = (i==0?0:prefix[i-1])
                         minimal x_i = floor((M - s_i) / B_i) + 1   ??? 

                         In the sample for task1: 
                             s_i = prefix0 = 4.
                             minimal x_i = floor((30-4)/10)+1 = floor(26/10)=2 -> 2+1=3.

                         But the sample used 2 pops.

                  Let's recompute for task1 in the sample using our new understanding: 
                         We require the finish time of task1 > M: 
                             f1 = last_pop + B_i = last_pop+10 > 30 -> last_pop>20.
                         And the last_pop must be < s_i + x_i * B_i = 4 + x_i * 10.
                         So we require: 
                             4 + x_i * 10 > 20  -> x_i>= ceil(17/10)=2.

                         So minimal x_i=2.

                  Therefore, the formula for task i to have its finish time> M is: 
                         x_i = ceil( (M - s_i + 1) / B_i ) 
                         because: 
                             last_pop must be > M - B_i.
                             and last_pop must be < s_i + x_i * B_i.
                             so we require: s_i + x_i * B_i > M - B_i + 1   (because last_pop must be at least floor(M-B_i)+1)
                             -> x_i * B_i > M - B_i + 1 - s_i
                             -> x_i > (M - B_i + 1 - s_i) / B_i
                             -> x_i = floor((M - B_i + 1 - s_i) / B_i) + 1  = ceil((M - B_i + 1 - s_i) / B_i) 
                                        = ceil((M+1 - (s_i+B_i)) / B_i) 
                                        = ceil((M+1 - prefix_i) / B_i)

                  But note: prefix_i = s_i + B_i.

                  In the sample: 
                         task1: s_i=4, B_i=10, prefix_i=14.
                         x_i = ceil((30+1 - 14)/10) = ceil(17/10)=2.

                  For task0: 
                         prefix0=4, 
                         x0 = ceil((30+1-4)/4)=ceil(27/4)=ceil(6.75)=7.

                  For task2: 
                         prefix2=19, 
                         x2 = ceil((30+1-19)/5)=ceil(12/5)=ceil(2.4)=3.

                  So the minimal x_i is 2.

                  Then we can win by using 2 pops on task1.

                  Therefore, the plan: 
                      Iterate i from 0 to kA-1:
                         s_i = (i==0?0:prefix[i-1])
                         x_i = ceil( (M+1 - prefix_i) / B_i )   [because prefix_i = s_i+B_i]
                         But note: if prefix_i > M, then we don't need any pop for this task to be not completed? Actually, the task might be completed if it is exactly at M? 
                                 But the problem: if the task finishes at M, then it is completed. We need it to be not completed, so we require the finish time> M.
                                 However, if prefix_i > M, then even without any pop, the task would finish at prefix_i > M? 
                                 But wait, without any pop, the task i would finish at prefix_i = s_i+B_i.
                                 And if that is > M, then the task is not completed. 

                         Actually, if the task i is not completed, then the next tasks are not even started. So we win.

                         Therefore, we don't need any pop for task i if prefix_i > M.

                         So we can win by using 0 pops in this case.

                  Therefore, the minimal number of pops to make the schedule win is the minimum over i in [0, kA-1] of 
                         cost_i = { 0 if prefix_i > M, 
                                    ceil((M+1 - prefix_i) / B_i) if prefix_i<=M }

                  And then if the minimum cost_i <= kA, then we win and we use cost_i pops on task i.

                  But note: if we use cost_i pops on task i, then we must ensure that the pops are within the available balloons at the time of popping.

                  Specifically, to pop during task i, we must have at least cost_i balloons by the time we do the pops. When does Ayu get the balloons? 
                         Ayu gets a balloon when she solves a task.

                  We are using pops on task i. The pops can be done at any integer minute from the time we get the balloon until minute M.

                  When do we have cost_i balloons? 
                         We get one balloon per task solved by Ayu. We have to do the pop before the contest ends (at or before M).

                  The first balloon is available at time prefixA[0] = A0.
                  The second at time prefixA[0]+A1, etc.

                  For task i, the pops must be in the interval [s_i, s_i + cost_i * B_i) and also we can only use balloons that are available by the pop time.

                  Specifically, the j-th balloon we use must be available by the time we use it.

                  We are cost_i pops on task i. We can choose the pop times arbitrarily within [max(s_i, available_time_j), min(s_i+cost_i*B_i, M)].

                  And we must have at least cost_i balloons available by the time we do the last pop.

                  The available_time for the j-th balloon is prefixA[j-1] (0-indexed).

                  Therefore, we need to choose i such that cost_i is minimal and also cost_i <= the number of balloons available by the time we do the pops, and the pops can be scheduled.

                  But note: the last pop for task i is at time p = s_i + cost_i * B_i - 1 (or earlier), and we require that by time p, Ayu has at least cost_i balloons.

                  The number of balloons available at time p is the number of tasks Ayu has solved by time p.

                  Since we are not told which task i we are going to use, we can choose any i.

                  So algorithm:
                    1. Compute kA: the number of tasks Ayu can solve.
                    2. Compute the prefix sums for A: 
                           prefixA[0] = A0
                           prefixA[1] = A0+A1
                           ...
                           kA = max{ k: prefixA[k-1] <= M } 
                    3. Compute the prefix sums for B for the first kA tasks: 
                           prefixB[0] = B0
                           prefixB[1] = B0+B1
                           ...
                           prefixB[i] = prefixB[i-1]+B_i, for i in [0, kA-1]

                    4. If there exists an i in [0, kA-1] such that prefixB[i] > M, then we win with 0 pops.

                    5. Otherwise, for i in [0, kA-1]:
                           if prefixB[i] > M:
                                cost_i = 0
                           else:
                                cost_i = ceil( (M+1 - prefixB[i]) / B_i )   [because the condition for task i: finish time > M]

                    6. Find the minimal cost_i over i. Let i0 = the index with minimal cost_i.

                    7. If minimal cost_i > kA, then it's impossible -> output -1.

                    8. Otherwise, we use cost_i0 pops on task i0.

                    9. Now, generate the actual pops for task i0: 
                           s_i0 = (i0==0?0:prefixB[i0-1])
                           We need cost_i0 pops in the interval [s_i0, s_i0 + cost_i0 * B_i0) such that the last pop is > M - B_i0 (so that the finish time = last_pop+B_i0 > M) and the pops are available (balloon available) and within [0,M].

                           Specifically, the pops are at distinct integers: 
                                p1, p2, ..., p_{cost_i0} 
                           with:
                                s_i0 <= p1 < p2 < ... < p_{cost_i0} < s_i0+cost_i0 * B_i0
                                and p_{cost_i0} > M - B_i0.

                           We also require that the j-th balloon is available by time p_j.

                           How to assign optimally? 
                                We want to use the cost_i0 balloons we have. We get the balloons at times: 
                                    balloon times: T0 = prefixA[0], T1 = prefixA[1], ... 
                                We need cost_i0 balloons by time p_{cost_i0} (the last pop). 
                                And p_{cost_i0} must be at least the time of the cost_i0-th balloon.

                           We can choose the pops arbitrarily in the interval. We should choose the largest possible values (to have them available) subject to the constraint that they must be strictly increasing and within [s_i0, s_i0+cost_i0 * B_i0) and the last one > M-B_i0.

                           Specifically, we try to set the pops as late as possible. 
                                last_pop = min(M, s_i0 + cost_i0 * B_i0 - 1) 
                                but we require last_pop > M - B_i0.

                                Since cost_i0 = ceil((M+1 - prefixB[i0])/B_i0), we have:
                                    s_i0 + cost_i0 * B_i0 >= M+1   -> 
                                    last_pop = s_i0 + cost_i0 * B_i0 - 1 >= M   may not hold? 

                                Actually, we have:
                                    cost_i0 = ceil( (M+1 - prefixB[i0]) / B_i0 ) 
                                        = floor( (M+1 - prefixB[i0] - 1) / B_i0 ) + 1 
                                        = floor( (M - prefixB[i0]) / B_i0 ) + 1

                                    then: 
                                        s_i0 + cost_i0 * B_i0 = (prefixB[i0] - B_i0) + cost_i0 * B_i0 
                                                               = prefixB[i0] + (cost_i0-1)*B_i0 
                                                               = ???

                                Alternatively, we know we require last_pop = p_{cost_i0} in ( max(s_i0, M-B_i0+1), s_i0+cost_i0 * B_i0 )

                                The length of the interval: 
                                    L = (s_i0+cost_i0 * B_i0 - 1) - max(s_i0, M-B_i0+1) + 1
                                    >= cost_i0 (because we need cost_i0 distinct integers) if the length>=cost_i0.

                                But we can choose the pops arbitrarily in that interval.

                                We also have to ensure that we have cost_i0 balloons by the last pop.

                                So we need the cost_i0-th balloon time <= the last pop time.

                         Steps to generate the pops for task i0:
                                Let L = max(s_i0, M-B_i0+1)   [the smallest pop must be at least L]
                                Let R = s_i0 + cost_i0 * B_i0 - 1   [the largest pop we can set]

                                If R > M, then we clamp R = M.

                                Then we need to choose cost_i0 distinct integers in [L, R] (which is an interval of length R-L+1).

                                We also require that the j-th pop is available by balloon j: 
                                      balloon_j = prefixA[j-1]  (0-indexed: balloon0 at time prefixA[0], balloon1 at prefixA[1], ...)

                                And we need cost_i0 balloons available by time R, so we require prefixA[cost_i0-1] <= R.

                                But we might have balloons available at different times.

                                How to assign the pops to balloon times? 
                                    We must have the pop at time p_j >= the balloon time for that balloon.

                                We can sort the available balloons up to cost_i0: they are prefixA[0], prefixA[1], ..., prefixA[cost_i0-1] (sorted increasingly).

                                We then need to assign to each balloon a pop time p_j such that:
                                    p_j >= prefixA[j]   [the j-th balloon is available at prefixA[j]]
                                    and L <= p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_{cost_i0} <= R.

                                This is possible if and only if for every j (0-indexed in the cost_i0 pops), 
                                    prefixA[j] <= R - (cost_i0-1-j)   [because the last pop must be at least prefixA[j] + (cost_i0-1-j) (since we need increasing distinct integers)]

                                Or simpler: 
                                    We can set p_j = max( prefixA[j], L+j ) 
                                    and then check if p_j <= R.

                                And then p_j must be increasing.

                                Alternatively, we can set the pops greedily: 
                                    Let j = 0
                                    Let current = L.
                                    For the balloons in increasing time order (balloon0, balloon1, ... balloon_{cost_i0-1]):
                                        p = max(current, balloon_time)
                                        then set this pop at p, then current = p+1.

                                    If we ever have p > R, then fail.

                         But we are free to choose the pops arbitrarily in [L, R] as long as they are increasing and >= the balloon times.

                         Since the balloon times are increasing, we can do:

                             p0 = max(L, balloon0)
                             p1 = max(p0+1, balloon1)
                             p2 = max(p1+1, balloon2)
                             ...

                         Then we need p_{cost_i0-1} <= R.

                         If that holds, then we output the list of pops.

                         Otherwise, we might try to space them out? But note, we have to use distinct integers.

                         However, there is a known necessary and sufficient condition: 
                             The j-th balloon must be placed at a time at least balloon_j, and the pops must be at least j apart (i.e., at least balloon0, balloon1, ... and distinct).

                         The minimal possible last pop is: 
                             p_min = max( balloon0, balloon1-1, balloon2-2, ... , balloon_{k-1}-(k-1) ) + (k-1)

                         So if p_min <= R, then we can schedule.

                  Given the complexity, we might try to generate the pops for the chosen task i0 using the greedy method above. 

                  Summary of the output part:

                    Let k = cost_i0 (the minimal cost we found for the best i0)
                    Let L = max( s_i0, M - B_i0 + 1 )
                    Let R = min(M, s_i0 + k * B_i0 - 1)

                    Then, we have balloons available at times: 
                         T[0..k-1] = [ prefixA[0], prefixA[1], ..., prefixA[k-1] ]

                    Then, we generate:
                         p0 = max(L, T[0])
                         p1 = max(p0+1, T[1])
                         p2 = max(p1+1, T[2])
                         ...
                    If the last pop p_{k-1} > R, then we have a problem. But note: we chose k as ceil((M+1-prefixB[i0])/B_i0), and we have balloon availability: 
                         We require that the k-th balloon is available by time R: T[k-1] <= R.

                    And our greedy ensures distinct increasing integers.

                    But we also require p_{k-1} <= R.

                    Condition: 
                         p_{k-1} = max( T[0] + k-1, T[1] + k-2, ... , T[k-1] ) 
                                 <= R

                    But we don't know. 

                  Alternatively, we can try to find the best i0 that minimizes cost_i0 and also satisfies the balloon constraint.

                  But the problem says: output any configuration.

                  We have freedom of i0. We can choose any i0 with cost_i0 minimal and then try to generate the pops. If one i0 works, output it. If not, try the next i0 with the same cost_i0? 

                  Steps for the entire algorithm:

                   1. Compute kA = max{ i: prefixA[i-1] <= M }   [if no task, then kA=0]
                   2. If kA==0: then Budi might solve some tasks? but we solve 0, so we require Budi solves <0 -> impossible -> output -1.
                   3. Compute prefixB[0..kA-1] for Budi for the first kA tasks.
                   4. If for any i in [0, kA-1], prefixB[i] > M then output 0 pops.

                   5. Let best_cost = a big number.
                   For i from 0 to kA-1:
                         cost_i = (prefixB[i] > M) ? 0 : ceil( (M+1 - prefixB[i]) / B_i );
                         if cost_i < best_cost, then best_cost = cost_i, best_i = i.

                   6. If best_cost > kA, then output -1.

                   7. Now, find an i0 in [0, kA-1] such that cost_i0 = best_cost and we can schedule the cost_i0 pops for task i0 (generate the increasing sequence within [L, R] and available by the balloons).

                   How to compute ceil(a/b) for integers? 
                         ceil(a/b) = (a-1)/b + 1   for positive a and b.

                   8. For a candidate i0 (starting with the one with minimal cost, but we might try one that works):

                         s_i0 = (i0==0?0:prefixB[i0-1])
                         L = max(s_i0, M - B_i0 + 1)
                         R = min(M, s_i0 + best_cost * B_i0 - 1)

                         // Check balloon availability for best_cost balloons: 
                         // We need the best_cost-th balloon time (prefixA[best_cost-1]) <= R.

                         // Now, generate the pops:
                         Let T[0..best_cost-1] = the balloon times: prefixA[0] to prefixA[best_cost-1]

                         Then:
                            vector<int> pops;
                            int current = L;
                            for j=0 to best_cost-1:
                                 int p = max(current, T[j]);
                                 if p > R: break out (fail for this i0)
                                 pops.push_back(p);
                                 current = p+1;

                         If we got best_cost pops, then output:
                              k = best_cost
                              the list of pops (sorted increasingly, which they are)

                   9. If we didn't find any i0, then we try another i0 with cost_i0 = best_cost? 

                   But note: there might be many i0 with the same cost. We can try them all until we find one that works.

                  10. If none works, then output -1? 

                  But is it possible that the minimal cost_i0 is feasible in terms of total count (<=kA) but we cannot schedule the pops because of the balloon timing or the interval [L,R] is too short?

                  Note: 
                      We have R = min(M, s_i0 + best_cost * B_i0 - 1) 
                      And L = max(s_i0, M - B_i0 + 1)

                      We require R>=L, and the length of the interval is R-L+1.

                      We also require that we can put best_cost integers in [L, R]: so R-L+1 >= best_cost.

                  And we require that the balloon times are <= R.

                  Specifically, the last balloon is at prefixA[best_cost-1] and we require that <= R.

                  And we require that the greedy assignment does not exceed R.

                  How to ensure R-L+1 >= best_cost? 
                         R-L+1 = [min(M, s_i0+best_cost*B_i0-1) - max(s_i0, M-B_i0+1)] + 1

                  This might be a tight bound.

                  Alternatively, we note that by the definition of best_cost (ceil((M+1-prefixB[i0])/B_i0)), we have:
                         best_cost = ceil( (M+1 - prefixB[i0]) / B_i0 )
                         -> best_cost >= (M+1 - prefixB[i0]) / B_i0 
                         -> s_i0 + best_cost * B_i0 >= s_i0 + (M+1 - prefixB[i0]) 
                                         = (prefixB[i0] - B_i0) + (M+1 - prefixB[i0]) = M+1 - B_i0

                         So R = min(M, s_i0+best_cost*B_i0-1) >= min(M, M+1 - B_i0 - 1) = min(M, M - B_i0) = M - B_i0   [if M-B_i0>=0]

                  Then L = max(s_i0, M-B_i0+1) <= M-B_i0+1.

                  So R - L + 1 >= (M-B_i0) - (M-B_i0+1) + 1 = 0? 

                  Not useful.

                  We know that:
                         R = min(M, s_i0+best_cost*B_i0-1) 
                         and L = M-B_i0+1   (if M-B_i0+1>=s_i0, which it might be)

                  Then R - L + 1 = min(M, s_i0+best_cost*B_i0-1) - (M-B_i0+1) + 1

                  = min(M - (M-B_i0+1) + 1, (s_i0+best_cost*B_i0-1) - (M-B_i0+1) + 1)

                  = min(B_i0, s_i0+best_cost*B_i0 - (M-B_i0+1) + 1 - 1) 
                  = ?

                  Given the complexity, we might simply try the candidate i0's in increasing order of cost_i0, and for the same cost by index order.

                  And hope that one works.

                  Given the sample1: 
                         i0=1 (task1, 0-indexed) with cost=2.
                         s_i0 = prefixB[0] = 4.
                         L = max(4, 30-10+1)=max(4,21)=21.
                         R = min(30, 4+2*10-1)=min(30,23)=23.
                         Balloons: we need 2 balloons. 
                             balloon0 = prefixA[0]=9
                             balloon1 = prefixA[1]=9+10=19.

                         Then:
                             p0 = max(21,9) = 21.
                             p1 = max(21+1=22, 19) = 22.

                         Then we output [21,22]? 

                         But the sample output is [12,19]. Why did they choose 12 and 19?

                  Note: they popped the first balloon at 12 and the second at 19. 
                  Why can we choose 12 and 19? 
                         For task1: 
                            pops must be in [4, 4+2*10)= [4,24) 
                            and we require the last pop>20 -> 19 is not>20.

                  But wait, in the sample output, they used two pops: 
                         first at 12: then Budi restarts at 12.
                         second at 19: then Budi restarts at 19, and then works from 19 to 29.

                  Why is the last pop at 19 allowed? Because the last pop must be >20? -> no, the condition for the finish time is last_pop+B_i>30 -> last_pop>20. 19 is not>20.

                  But the sample says the task1 finished at 29. 

                  What is the condition for the finish time? 
                         last_pop + B_i = 19+10=29<=30 -> then the task is completed.

                  What went wrong? 

                  We must ensure that the task is not completed. The sample output does not make task1 exceed M. Instead, it only made task2 not start.

                  Therefore, we do not require that the task we popped is not completed, but we only require that the overall number of tasks completed by Budi is at most kA-1.

                  In the sample, by popping during task1, they delayed task1 so that it finished at 29, and then task2 started at 29 and only did 1 minute by 30? -> not completed.

                  So we only require that the last task (kA-1) is not completed. 

                  How many tasks does Budi complete? 
                         task0: completed at 4.
                         task1: completed at 29.
                         task2: started at 29, and worked for 1 minute (30-29=1) -> not completed.

                  So completed tasks: 2.

                  And kA=3.

                  So we win.

                  Therefore, we don't need to make a particular task exceed M. We only need to use the pops to make sure that the start time of task kA is after M? 

                  But the start time of task kA is the finish time of task kA-1.

                  We require that the start time of task kA is > M, then it is not even started.

                  And the tasks that are completed are the first kA-1 tasks.

                  Then the number of completed tasks is kA-1.

                  How to compute the minimal number of pops to make the start time of task kA (which is the finish time of task kA-1) > M?

                         Let s = prefixB[kA-1]   (the finish time of task kA-1 without any pop)
                         Then we need to assign some pops to task kA-1 to make its finish time > M.

                         The minimal number of pops for task kA-1 is x = ceil( (M+1 - s) / B_{kA-1} )   if s<=M, or 0 if s>M.

                  Then if x<=kA, then we win by using x pops on task kA-1.

                  But is it the only way? 

                  We could also pops on earlier tasks to delay the start of task kA-1, and then use fewer pops on task kA-1.

                  However, the problem: we want the minimal total pops.

                  But note: we are not required to minimize the number of pops, only to output any configuration.

                  So we can choose to put all pops on the last task (task kA-1) that Ayu's last task (which is the one that gives the balloon for the last pop) is solved at time prefixA[kA-1] (which is the total time for Ayu to solve her first kA tasks), and this is <=M.

                  And we require that the last pop is at time <=M.

                  Therefore, we can try:

                         x = ceil( (M+1 - prefixB[kA-1]) / B_{kA-1} )   [if prefixB[kA-1]<=M, else 0]

                  and then if x<=kA, then use x pops on task kA-1.

                  Generate the pops similarly.

                  Why is this sufficient? 
                         Because the finish time of task kA-1 will be last_pop + B_{kA-1} > M, so the next task (task kA) is not even started.

                  But note: task kA is not part of the first kA tasks of Budi? Budi has N tasks, but we only care that he completes at most kA-1 tasks.

                  And the first kA-1 tasks are completed? 

                         Without pops, the first kA-1 tasks would be completed by time prefixB[kA-2] (<= prefixB[kA-1] - B_{kA-1} <= M - something). 

                         With pops only on task kA-1, the earlier tasks are unaffected. So the first kA-1 tasks are completed.

                  But then the number of tasks completed by Budi is kA-1, and Ayu completed kA, so we win.

                  Therefore, a simpler solution:

                   1. Compute kA.
                   2. If kA==0, output -1.
                   3. Compute the prefix sums for A: prefixA[0..kA-1] (for the first kA tasks)
                   4. Compute the prefix sums for B for the first kA tasks: prefixB[0..kA-1]

                   5. If prefixB[kA-1] > M:
                         then we can win with 0 pops? 
                         But wait: if the entire schedule of the first kA tasks is >M, then Budi completes fewer than kA tasks? 
                             Specifically, the number of tasks completed by Budi is the largest j such that prefixB[j]<=M.
                             Let kB = that number.
                             Then if kB < kA, we win with 0 pops.

                         So if kB < kA, output 0.
                         But note: we computed prefixB[kA-1] > M, so kB < kA.

                         Therefore, output 0.

                   6. Otherwise, if prefixB[kA-1] <= M, then we try to use pops on the last task (task kA-1) to make its finish time > M.

                         x = ceil( (M+1 - prefixB[kA-1]) / B_{kA-1} )   [because the task we are popping is the last one, task id = kA-1]

                   7. If x > kA, then output -1.

                   8. Otherwise, generate x pops for task kA-1:

                         s = prefixB[kA-2]   [start time of task kA-1]  (if kA-1==0, then s=0)
                         L = max(s, M - B_{kA-1} + 1)
                         R = min(M, s + x * B_{kA-1} - 1)

                         balloons = the first x balloons: prefixA[0] to prefixA[x-1]

                         Then greedy:
                            vector<int> pops;
                            current = L
                            for j in range(x):
                                 p = max(current, prefixA[j])
                                 pops.push_back(p)
                                 current = p+1

                         If we cannot (p>R for some j), then we try with the next candidate? 

                         But note: we have to use this method. 

                   9. If the greedy generation succeeded (pops.size()==x and the last is<=R), then output x and the pops.

                   10. If the greedy failed, then we try with a different task? 

                  However, note: we might try the last task and it might fail because of balloon timing, but then we try the one with minimal cost among all tasks.

                  Given the time, we will output the solution for the last task only.

                  But the sample: 
                      last task = task index 2 (0-indexed) for Budi? 
                         prefixB[2]=4+10+5=19.
                         B_{2}=5.
                         x = ceil((30+1-19)/5)=ceil(12/5)=ceil(2.4)=3.

                      then we would use 3 pops on task2.

                  But the sample used 2 pops on task1.

                  So we must try the minimal cost over all tasks.

                  Therefore, we will do:

                   steps 1 to 6 as above (computing best_cost over i in [0, kA-1])
                   then for the candidate tasks i0 in increasing order of cost_i0 (and then by i0 increasing) until we find one that works:

                         generate the pops (greedy in the interval [L,R] for balloon times T[0..x-1])

                   then output.

                  Let's hope it's efficient.

                  Note: kA is up to 100000, and we only try until we find one candidate.

                  Implementation:

                    // Read input
                    // Compute kA for Ayu
                    // Compute prefixB for Budi for the first kA tasks.

                    vector<long long> prefixA, prefixB;
                    int kA = 0;
                    long long sumA = 0;
                    for(int i=0; i<N; i++) {
                         if (sumA + A[i] <= M) {
                             kA++;
                             sumA += A[i];
                         } else {
                             break;
                         }
                    }

                    // If kA==0, output -1 and exit.

                    // Compute prefixB for i=0 to min(kA, N)-1.
                    // Also, note: we only have kA tasks for Budi as well? not more.

                    long long sumB = 0;
                    for(int i=0; i<kA; i++) {
                         sumB += B[i];
                         prefixB.push_back(sumB);
                    }

                    // If there exists i such that prefixB[i] > M, then output 0.
                    // But note: we want the first kA tasks: if any prefixB[i] > M, then kB = i (tasks completed: i), and i<kA -> win.
                    // Actually, if prefixB[kA-1] > M, then we output 0.

                    // But if not, then we find best_cost = a big number, best_i = -1.

                    // Also, note: if for a task i, we have prefixB[i] > M, then cost_i=0, and we can win with 0 pops.

                    // So we can do:
                    int best_cost = INT_MAX;
                    vector<int> candidate_i;
                    for (int i=0; i<kA; i++) {
                         if (prefixB[i] > M) {
                             best_cost = 0;
                             candidate_i.clear();
                             candidate_i.push_back(i); // any one with cost 0 will do, and we output 0 pops.
                             break;
                         }
                         // cost_i = ceil((M+1 - prefixB[i]) / B[i])
                         // = (M+1 - prefixB[i] + B[i] - 1) / B[i]  -> then floor division?
                         // ceil(a/b) = (a-1)/b+1 for positive integers.

                         long long a = M+1 - prefixB[i];

                         bool valid = true;
                         for (int j=0; j<best_cost; j++) {

                                 long long p = max(current, balloons[j]);

                                     break;
                                 }
                                 pops.push_back(p);
                                 current = p+1;
                         }
                         if (valid) {
                             // output the answer
                             cout << best_cost << endl;
                             for (int j=0; j<best_cost; j++) {
                                 cout << pops[j] << (j<best_cost-1?' ':'\n');
                             }
                             return;
                         }
                    }

                    // if no candidate works, then try next best_cost? 
                    // But we found best_cost is minimal, and there might be a candidate with the same best_cost that we haven't tried? 
                    // We tried all candidate_i with cost = best_cost.

                    // If none works, then we try to use the last task (kA-1) regardless of cost? 
                    // But we already considered it in candidate_i.

                    cout << -1 << endl;

                  However, note: it is possible that the minimal cost is best_cost, but none of the candidates works because of the balloon timing. Then we should output -1.

                  Let's hope the constraints are not tight.

                  Note: worst-case, candidate_i may be the entire array (100000) and for each candidate we do a loop of best_cost (which might be up to kA=100000) -> 10e10 operations.

                  We need to avoid that.

                  How to avoid? 

                  We note that best_cost might be large. But best_cost is at most kA, and if best_cost is large (like close to kA), then the balloon vector is also large (size=best_cost) and the loop is heavy.

                  We might break early in the greedy if current is already > R.

                  But worst-case we do 100000 * (number of candidates) which might be 100000*100000.

                  Alternative: we can also break if the candidate has no chance: 
                         The necessary condition: 
                             balloons[best_cost-1] <= R   (we check that above)

                         and the minimal possible last pop is: 
                             p_last = max( L+best_cost-1, balloons[best_cost-1] )

                         and if p_last <= R, then it is possible. But note: the greedy assignment might work if the minimal possible last pop is<=R.

                         How to compute the minimal possible last pop without simulating? 
                             p_last = the maximum of:
                                 (balloons[j] + (best_cost-1 - j)) for j in [0, best_cost-1] 
                                 and L+best_cost-1.

                         So if max( L+best_cost-1, max_j { balloons[j] + (best_cost-1 - j) } ) <= R, then it is possible.

                  Therefore, for a candidate i0, we can:

                         // condition1: balloons[best_cost-1] <= R   (already checked)
                         // condition2: we need to compute M1 = max_{j=0}^{best_cost-1} [ balloons[j] + (best_cost-1 - j) ] 
                         // and then if max(L+best_cost-1, M1) <= R, then the greedy will work.

                  Then we don't need to simulate.

                  How to compute M1 quickly? 
                         We can precompute M1 for the balloon vector of size best_cost? 
                         But we have many candidates.

                  Alternatively, we can compute M1 once for the fixed balloon vector (which depends only on best_cost) and then use it for every candidate.

                  But note: the balloon vector is the same for every candidate: it is prefixA[0] to prefixA[best_cost-1].

                  So we can compute:
                         M1 = 0;
                         for (int j=0; j<best_cost; j++) {
                              M1 = max(M1, balloons[j] + (best_cost-1 - j));
                         }

                  Then for each candidate i0:
                         condition: max(L+best_cost-1, M1) <= R

                  And then we output the candidate i0 that satisfies that condition.

                  And then generate the pops without the greedy? Actually, we can generate the pops by:

                         vector<long long> pops(best_cost);
                         long long shift = max(0LL, max(L+best_cost-1, M1) - R); // if positive then fail, so skip.

                         // If we passed the condition, then we can set:

                         // We want to shift the schedule as late as possible? 
                         //  let base = R - (best_cost-1);
                         //  then set pops[j] = max(balloons[j], base+j) 
                         //  but then the last pop = base+best_cost-1 = R.

                         // However, we also require pops[j] >= balloons[j] and distinct and increasing.

                         // This might work, but let's do the greedy since best_cost might be large.

                         // Actually, we already know it is possible, so we do the greedy.

                  Given time constraints, we will do the condition with M1 and then if it holds, then we do the greedy for one candidate to generate the pops.

                  Summary of final algorithm:

                   // ... as before until we have best_cost and the balloon vector and M1 = max_j [balloons[j] + (best_cost-1-j)]

                   for (int i0: candidate_i) {
                         s_i0 = (i0==0?0:prefixB[i0-1])
                         L = max(s_i0, M - B[i0] + 1);
                         R = min<long long>(M, s_i0 + (long long)best_cost * B[i0] - 1);

                         if (balloons[best_cost-1] > R) continue;

                         if (max(L + best_cost - 1, M1) <= R) {
                             // then generate by greedy
                             vector<long long> pops;
                             long long current = L;
                             for (int j=0; j<best_cost; j++) {
                                 long long p = max(current, balloons[j]);
                                 pops.push_back(p);
                                 current = p+1;
                             }
                             // output
                             cout << best_cost << endl;
                             for (int j=0; j<best_cost; j++) {
                                 cout << pops[j] << (j<best_cost-1?' ':'\n');
                             }
                             return;
                         }
                   }

                   // if none found, output -1

                  Let's test with sample1 and i0=1:
                         best_cost=2.
                         M1 = max( balloons[0]+(2-1-0), balloons[1]+(2-1-1) ) 
                              = max(9+1, 19+0) = max(10,19)=19.
                         L = 21, R=23.
                         L+best_cost-1 = 21+1=22.
                         max(22,19)=22 <=23 -> works.

                  Then we generate: 
                         j0: p0 = max(21,9)=21.
                         j1: p1 = max(21+1=22,19)=22.

                  Output: [21,22]

                  But the sample output is [12,19]. Why is that acceptable? 

                  Note: our condition only requires that the last task is not completed, but the sample used a different task.

                  However, the problem: output any valid configuration.

                  So [21,22] is valid.

                  But will it work for the sample1?

                  With pops at 21 and 22 on task1 (Budi's second task) -> 
                         Budi: 
                           task0: 0 to 4.
                           task1: 
                               4: start.
                               at 21: pop -> restart at 21.
                               at 22: pop -> restart at 22.
                               then works from 22 to 22+10=32>30 -> not completed at 30.
                         So task1 not completed.

                         Budi only completed task0.

                  Then Ayu completed 3, and Budi completed 1 -> Ayu wins.

                  But the sample output has Budi completing task0 and task1.

                  In our configuration, we only require that the number of solved tasks of Ayu is strictly greater than Budi's.

                  Here, 3>1, so it works.

                  However, the sample output has 3>2.

                  So both are valid.

                  Therefore, we output [21,22].

                  But note: the sample input has a note: output sorted in increasing order.

                  We are outputting sorted increasingly.

                  Another sample: sample2
                    5 50
                    A = [10,10,10,10,10] -> kA=5, because 10*5=50<=50.
                    B = [15,12,19,17,20]

                    prefixB: 
                        0:15
                        1:15+12=27
                        2:27+19=46
                        3:46+17=63 -> exceeds 50? 
                        4: ... 

                    But kA=5, but prefixB[4] is not needed.

                    We are only concerned with the first 5 tasks of Budi? 
                         But the sample output is 0.

                    Why? 
                         Budi's tasks: 
                            task0:15<=50 -> solved.
                            task1:15+12=27<=50 -> solved.
                            task2:27+19=46<=50 -> solved.
                            task3:46+17=63>50 -> not solved.
                            task4: not started.
                         so Budi solved 3 tasks.

                         Ayu solved 5 tasks? 
                             But the contest duration is 50, and Ayu needs 50 minutes -> at minute 50 she solves the last task.
                         So Ayu solved 5.

                         5>3 -> win.

                    Therefore, output 0.

                  How does our algorithm for sample2:

                    kA=5.
                    prefixB[4] = 15+12+19+17+20 = 83>50, then we output 0.

                  Sample3: 
                    "5 10
                     15 10 5 5 5
                     9 10 10 10 10"

                    Ayu: 
                         task0:15>10 -> kA=0.
                    then output -1.

                  Therefore, we are done.

                  Note: we assume that the arrays A and B are of length N.

                  Implementation note: 
                    We must use long long because M up to 10^9 and A_i, B_i up to 10^9, and N up to 100000.

                  Let's code accordingly.

                                     cout << pops[j];
                                     if (j < best_cost-1) cout << ' ';
                                 }
                                 cout << endl;
                                 return 0;
                             }
                         }

                         // If no candidate works.
                         cout << -1 << endl;
                         return 0;
                    }

                  Let's test with sample1: 
                    N=4, M=30
                    A = [9,10,10,10] -> kA=3 (since 9+10+10=29<=30, but 9+10+10+10=39>30 -> kA=3)
                    B = [4,10,5,10] -> we only use the first 3: [4,10,5]

                    prefixB: 
                         i0:0: 4
                         i1:1: 14
                         i2:2: 19

                    Check: all <=30.

                    best_cost = min_i cost_i:
                         i0: cost0 = ceil((30+1-4)/4) = ceil(27/4)= ceil(6.75)=7.
                         i1: cost1 = ceil((30+1-14)/10)=ceil(17/10)=ceil(1.7)=2.
                         i2: cost2 = ceil((30+1-19)/5)=ceil(12/5)=ceil(2.4)=3.

                    best_cost=2, candidate_i = [1]

                    balloons for the first 2 tasks: 
                         balloon0 = 9
                         balloon1 = 9+10=19

                    M1 = max(9+ (2-1-0)=9+1=10, 19+(2-1-1)=19+0=19) = 19.

                    candidate_i0 = 1:
                         s_i0 = prefixB[0] = 4.
                         L = max(4, 30-10+1)=max(4,21)=21.
                         R = min(30, 4+2*10-1)=min(30,23)=23.
                         Check: balloons[1]=19<=23 -> OK.
                         Check: max(21+2-1, 19) = max(22,19)=22<=23 -> works.

                    Then generate pops: 
                         j0: p0 = max(21,9)=21.
                         j1: p1 = max(22,19)=22.

                    Output:
                         2
                         21 22

                  But the sample output is "2\n12 19", but our output is also valid.

                  We'll output 21 and 22.

                  The problem says: output any configuration.

                  So we are done.

                  Note: the sample might be sensitive to the chosen task and the pops. But the problem allows any.

                  Let's run on sample2 and sample3 to be safe.

                  Sample2: 
                    We don't enter the candidate loop because we found a task with cost=0.

                  Sample3: 
                    kA=0 -> output -1.

                  Another sample: sample input #2: 
                    "5 50
                     10 10 10 10 10
                     15 12 19 17 20"

                    kA=5 -> sumA=50<=50.
                    prefixB: 
                        0:15
                        1:27
                        2:46
                        3:63 -> but we only compute for kA=5, so we compute the entire 5: 
                        3:46+17=63
                        4:63+20=83
                    Then we check: is there any i such that prefixB[i]>50? 
                         i0=0:15<=50
                         i0=1:27<=50
                         i0=2:46<=50
                         i0=3:63>50 -> found=true -> output 0.

                  This matches.

                  We'll submit.

                  Note: the condition for the candidate_i0 also checks the last balloon time: if the last balloon time is > R, we skip.

                  But note: we compute R as min(M, s_i0+best_cost*B_i0-1). And if the last balloon is > R, then we cannot use that candidate.

                  This is because we cannot pop a balloon before it is available.

                  We hope it passes.

                  Note: the problem has a time limit of 1s.

                  We do O(kA) for the candidate_i and also O(best_cost) for the balloons and for the M1 computation.

                  Since best_cost<=kA, and kA<=100000, it is O(100000).

                  But we try at most 100000 candidates? Actually, we break out as soon as we find one candidate that works.

                  However, in the worst-case, we might try all candidates. But the candidate_i vector may be large.

                  We can break the candidate_i set by sorting and then trying candidates that are more likely to work? 

                  But worst-case the candidate_i set size is O(kA). And for each candidate, we do O(1) (since we don't do the greedy if we use the condition with M1).

                  So overall O(kA).

                  We'll code accordingly.

                  Let me fix: we precomputed M1 once. Then for each candidate_i0, we do O(1) to check.

                  So it is O(kA).

                  Code accordingly.

                  Note: integer types: use long long.

                  One more: if kA is 0, we break early.

                  Let me run the sample1 with the code.

                  I'll write the code accordingly.

                  However, note: the condition for the last balloon availability: we do 
                         if (balloons[best_cost-1] > R) continue;

                  But what if best_cost is 0? we skip, but we handled best_cost==0 earlier.

                  So we are safe.

                  Let me write the code.

                  Note: the division for cost_i: we did (a-1)/B[i] + 1. 
                         For a=17, B[i]=10: 
                             (17-1)=16, 16/10=1, then 1+1=2 -> correct.

                  Code:
