To solve this problem, we need to determine whether Ayu can win the competition by having strictly more solved tasks than Budi, by strategically popping balloons to disrupt Budi's progress. The solution involves analyzing both Ayu's and Budi's task completion times and determining if Ayu can prevent Budi from completing enough tasks using balloon pops.

### Approach
1. **Compute Ayu's Solved Tasks**: Calculate the number of tasks Ayu can solve within the given time \( M \). This is done by iterating through the tasks and accumulating their times until the cumulative time exceeds \( M \). The count of tasks completed before this point is \( k \).

2. **Check for Immediate Win**: If Ayu solves zero tasks (\( k = 0 \)), it's impossible for her to win, so we output \(-1\).

3. **Simulate Budi's Progress**: Compute the start times for Budi's tasks assuming no disruptions. For each task, check if Budi would naturally fail to complete it within \( M \) minutes (i.e., his start time plus the task time exceeds \( M \)). If any task fails naturally, Ayu wins without popping any balloons, so we output \( 0 \).

4. **Strategic Balloon Popping**: If no natural failures are found, we determine the minimal popping time to disrupt one of Budi's tasks. For each task, the popping time is calculated as the maximum of:
   - Budi's start time for the task.
   - The time Ayu receives her first balloon.
   - \( M - B_i + 1 \) (to ensure the task completion time exceeds \( M \)).
   
   The minimal such popping time across all tasks is chosen to minimize disruption time. Ayu pops a balloon at this time, causing Budi to restart the task and fail to complete it within \( M \) minutes.

### Solution Code
```python
import sys

def main():
    data = sys.stdin.read().split()
    if not data:
        return
    it = iter(data)
    n = int(next(it))
    M_val = int(next(it))
    A = [int(next(it)) for _ in range(n)]
    B = [int(next(it)) for _ in range(n)]
    
    prefixA = [0]
    k = 0
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total += A[i]
        if total <= M_val:
            prefixA.append(total)
            k = len(prefixA) - 1
        else:
            break
            
    if k == 0:
        print(-1)
        return
        
    s_arr = [0]
    for i in range(k):
        next_s = s_arr[-1] + B[i]
        s_arr.append(next_s)
        
    for i in range(k):
        if s_arr[i] + B[i] > M_val:
            print(0)
            return
            
    first_balloon = prefixA[1]
    best_t = float('inf')
    for i in range(k):
        t_val = max(s_arr[i], first_balloon, M_val - B[i] + 1)
        if t_val < best_t:
            best_t = t_val
            
    print(1)
    print(best_t)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of tasks \( N \), the competition duration \( M \), and the arrays \( A \) and \( B \) representing Ayu's and Budi's task times, respectively.
2. **Ayu's Task Calculation**: The cumulative time for Ayu's tasks is computed. The loop stops when adding the next task's time would exceed \( M \). The count of tasks completed (\( k \)) is derived from the length of the `prefixA` array.
3. **Early Termination Check**: If \( k \) is zero (Ayu solves no tasks), the output is \(-1\) since Ayu cannot win.
4. **Budi's Progress Simulation**: The start times for Budi's tasks are computed. For each task, if the natural completion time (start time + task time) exceeds \( M \), Ayu wins without any balloon pops, so \( 0 \) is printed.
5. **Balloon Popping Strategy**: For each task, the minimal popping time that ensures Budi fails the task is calculated. This time is the maximum of Budi's start time, Ayu's first balloon time, and \( M - \text{task time} + 1 \). The smallest such time across all tasks is chosen to minimize disruption.
6. **Output Result**: The result is \( 1 \) followed by the computed popping time, indicating Ayu pops one balloon at this time to ensure Budi fails at least one task, allowing Ayu to win. 

This approach efficiently checks for natural wins and strategically uses balloon pops to disrupt Budi's progress, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.
