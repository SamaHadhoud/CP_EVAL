 We are given R and C (rows and columns) and then R lines of C characters.
 The grid has '#' for dry land and '.' for icy land.

 The key idea:
 To visit all cells, we must be able to stop in every row and every column (because if there is a row with no dry land, then we cannot stop in that row, and similarly for a column). Therefore, we require at least one dry land in every row and every column.

 However, note: if we convert an icy cell ('.') to dry ('#'), then that cell will cover both its row and its column.

 Therefore, we can model the problem as:
   Let emptyRows = list of rows that have no dry land.
   Let emptyCols = list of columns that have no dry land.

 We wish to cover every empty row and every empty column by converting some icy cells to dry land. 
 But note: if we convert a cell (r, c) which is currently icy (so grid[r][c]=='.') and which lies in an empty row r and empty column c, then converting that cell will cover row r and column c simultaneously.

 Thus, we can form a bipartite graph:
   Left set: emptyRows (indexed 0..A-1, where A = |emptyRows|)
   Right set: emptyCols (indexed 0..B-1, where B = |emptyCols|)
   Edge from row i (in the emptyRows list) to column j (in the emptyCols list) if and only if grid[emptyRows[i]][emptyCols[j]] is '.'.

 Then we wish to find the maximum matching in this bipartite graph. The reason is that each edge in the matching corresponds to a single conversion that covers one row and one column.

 Then the minimum number of conversions required is: 
      (number of emptyRows) + (number of emptyCols) - (size of maximum matching)

 Why? Because we can cover as many rows and columns as possible by the matching (each matching covers one row and one column). Then the remaining rows and columns must be covered individually.

 However, note: what if there is no edge? Then we cannot cover both the row and column at the same time, so we have to cover each separately.

 Example: Consider the sample input:
      4 4
      ....
      .###
      ##..
      ###.

   Initially, row0: ['.','.', '.', '.'] -> no '#' -> empty row -> row0 is empty.
            row1: ['.','#','#','#'] -> has '#' -> not empty.
            row2: ['#','#','.', '.'] -> has '#' -> not empty.
            row3: ['#','#','#','.'] -> has '#' -> not empty.

   Columns:
            col0: ['.','.', '#','#'] -> has '#' -> not empty.
            col1: ['.','#','#','#'] -> has '#' -> not empty.
            col2: ['.','#','.', '#'] -> has '#' -> not empty? Actually, row0, col2 is '.' -> but row2 has a '#' in col2? Yes, so col2 is not empty.
            col3: ['.','#','.','.'] -> row0: '.' -> no dry land? Actually, row1 has a '#' in col3 -> so col3 is not empty.

   But wait: row0 is empty? Yes. However, the sample output says we change one cell.

   Let's recheck the sample: 
        row0: all '.' -> empty -> yes.
        row1: has '#' -> no.
        row2: has '#' -> no.
        row3: has '#' -> no.

        col0: row0: '.'; row1: '.' -> but row2: '#' -> so col0 has at least one dry land -> not empty.
        col1: row0: '.'; row1: '#' -> so col1 is not empty.
        col2: row0: '.'; row2: '#' -> not empty.
        col3: row0: '.'; row1: '#' -> not empty.

   So only row0 is empty? Then why the answer is 1? 

   Actually, let me look again at the sample input:

        ....
        .###
        ##..
        ###.

   The corrected grid:

        row0: "...." -> no dry land -> empty.
        row1: ".###" -> has dry land -> not empty.
        row2: "##.." -> has dry land -> not empty.
        row3: "###." -> has dry land -> not empty.

   Columns:

        col0: ['.','.', '#','#'] -> row2 and row3 have '#' -> so col0 is not empty.
        col1: ['.','#','#','#'] -> not empty.
        col2: ['.','#','.', '#'] -> row2 has a '.'? but row1 and row3 have '#' -> so col2 is not empty? 
                Actually, we require at least one dry land. The col2: 
                  row0: '.' -> icy -> no dry land here.
                  row1: '#' -> dry land -> so col2 is not empty.

        col3: ['.','#','.', '.'] -> row1 has a '#' -> so col3 is not empty.

   Then why do we need to change one cell? 

   The problem is that even though the columns are not empty, we still might not be able to visit the entire board from any starting position? 

   However, the problem states: "you can always visit all the cells in the board regardless of your initial starting position".

   The insight is that the problem requires that every row and every column must have at least one dry land? Actually, note:

        In the sample, after changing (2,2) (0-indexed row2, col2) to dry land, we get:

          row0: "...." -> still no dry land -> so row0 is empty? Then why the answer is 1 and we are done?

        But wait: the sample output says 1 and the sample input is 4x4.

   What's the catch?

   Actually, the problem is more subtle: the condition we require is that every row and every column must have at least one dry land? 

   Why? Because if a row has no dry land, then if we start in that row we can only slide through without stopping. However, we cannot stop in that row to "visit" the cells? But note: we can pass through without stopping. The problem states: "Cells in which you only passed through are also not considered as visited".

   Therefore, to visit a cell in an icy row (with no dry land), we must start exactly on that cell? But the problem states "regardless of your initial starting position" meaning that we don't know the start. However, if we start in a different row, we might slide through the icy row without stopping. But we cannot stop in that row? So we cannot visit any cell in that row? 

   Similarly, for a column.

   Therefore, we must have at least one dry land in every row and every column. 

   But in the sample after changing (2,2) (which is row2, col2) to dry land, we get:

        row0: still no dry land -> so row0 remains empty? 

   Then why is the answer 1? 

   Actually, let me look at the sample explanation: they changed cell (3,3). Note: the problem uses 1-indexed. So (3,3) is row2, col2 in 0-indexed. Then the grid becomes:

        row0: "...."   -> still no dry land -> empty.
        row1: ".###"   -> has dry land.
        row2: "###."   -> note: they changed the third row (which is index2) and third column (index2) from '.' to '#' -> so row2: "## #." -> becomes "###."? Actually, the sample output shows:

          ....
          .###
          ###.   -> this is row2: originally "##..", becomes "###."? 
          ###.

        Now row0 is still empty? 

   However, the sample then shows that starting at (1,1) (which is row0, col0) we can do:

        (1,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (4,2) -> (3,2) -> (2,2) -> ... and then they visit row0 at (1,3) and (1,4).

        How do they visit row0? 

        They start at (1,1) and then move "SS" (south twice) to (3,1). Then they move east to (3,2), then north to (2,2). Then later, they go to (2,3) and then (1,3). 

        But note: to get to (1,3), they must have been at (2,3) and then moved north. When moving north from (2,3), they slide until they hit a dry land? 

        The grid after conversion:

          row0: "...."   -> still all icy.
          row1: ".###"   -> dry lands at col1, col2, col3.
          row2: "###."   -> dry lands at col0, col1, col2, and col3 is icy? Actually, the third character in row2 is now '#' (because we changed (3,3) -> which is row2, col2 to '#')? Then row2: "###." -> meaning col0, col1, col2 are '#' and col3 is '.'.

        So when at (2,3) (which is row1, col3) and then moving north: 
            (2,3) -> row0, col3? But row0, col3 is icy -> so we slide until we hit the border? Then we end at row0, col3? 

        That is: from (2,3) we move north: we start at row1, col3 (which is dry? no, because row1: ".###" -> so row1, col3 is '#' -> dry). Then we can stand still? Then we move north: we go to row0, col3 -> icy -> but then we slide? But we are at row0, col3 and then we try to move north? We are at the border? So we stop at row0, col3.

        So we do stop at row0, col3? 

        Therefore, we can visit row0, col3 by starting from a dry land in row1, col3 and moving north? 

        But note: we require that we can visit all cells. How do we visit row0, col0? 

        The sample sequence: 
            (1,1) -> ... -> (1,4) -> ... and then they say they visit (1,3) and (1,4). But how about (1,0) and (1,1)? 

        They start at (1,1) -> that's row0, col0? (if 1-indexed: row1, col1 -> but they say (1,1) is the start). In 0-indexed, that is (0,0). 

        Then they move "SS": two souths: from (0,0) -> south to row1, col0: icy -> slide until dry land? row1, col0: icy? -> actually row1: ".###" -> the first character is '.' -> so row1, col0 is icy -> then we slide until we hit a dry land? The next south: row2, col0: now row2 is "###." -> row2, col0 is '#' -> so we stop at row2, col0? 

        Then the next move is "E": east from row2, col0: now row2, col1 is '#' -> we can step to row2, col1? Then move east again? row2, col2 is '#' -> row2, col3 is icy -> then we slide east until we hit the border? So we go to row2, col3 (the border) -> stop at row2, col3? 

        Then how do we get to row0? 

        Actually, the sequence provided: "SSENNWENSESSESWENWENWNE" is long. 

        However, note: the problem says that we changed only one cell and then it becomes possible.

        The key is that after the change, we have at least one dry land in every column? Actually, we have:

          col0: row2: '#' -> exists.
          col1: row1: '#' -> exists.
          col2: row2: '#' -> exists (we changed it) and also row1: '#' -> exists.
          col3: row1: '#' -> exists.

        But row0 has no dry land? How do we stop in row0? 

        We don't need to stop in row0? We can stop at the border? 

        Actually, the problem states: "If you stand at cell (r, c) and decide to move on a particular direction, then you will move on that direction continuously until you reach a dry land or the border of the board."

        Therefore, we can stop at the border without a dry land? 

        But note: to visit a cell in the middle of the row (not the border) in an icy row, we cannot stop there? Only if we start at that cell? 

        However, the problem says "regardless of your initial starting position". So if we start at a border cell, we can stand still? But if the border cell is icy, then if we try to move away from the border we slide? But if we don't move, we remain? 

        Actually, the problem says: "You can walk or standstill on any dry land without any problem". So if we are on an icy land, we cannot standstill? We must move? 

        But the problem does not explicitly say what happens when we are on an icy land and we do nothing? However, the moves are given as a sequence. We are forced to move in a particular direction.

        However, to visit a cell in the middle of an icy row (say row0, col1) that has no dry land, we must start at that cell? Because if we start at a dry land and try to move to that cell, we will slide through it without stopping? 

        Therefore, to visit row0, col1, we must start at row0, col1? But the problem says "regardless of your initial starting position", meaning that we are allowed to choose the sequence of moves for any starting position? 

        The problem statement: "you can always visit all the cells in the board regardless of your initial starting position"

        So if the starting position is arbitrary, then we must be able to visit all cells even if we start at any cell. 

        Therefore, if there is a row with no dry land, then if we start in that row, we can never stop? Then we cannot change direction arbitrarily? 

        Actually, we can only move in one direction until we hit a dry land or border. But if we are in the middle of an icy row and we move, we slide to the border? Then we are at the border. Then we can move again? 

        However, note that at the border we are on an icy land? Then if we move along the border (e.g., south from the top border) we slide? 

        The problem: we must visit every cell. How do we visit the cell in the middle of the icy row? 

        We can only be at that cell if we start at it? But then if we start at it, we can standstill? 

        Actually, the problem says: "You can walk or standstill on any dry land". On icy land, we cannot standstill? 

        The problem says: "If you stand at cell (r, c) and decide to move on a particular direction, ...". This implies that if we are on an icy land, we can standstill? Or does it imply that we are forced to move? 

        The problem does not explicitly say we cannot standstill on icy land. But note: the example: "From (1,3) ..." and they slide. So it seems that if you are on icy land and you choose a direction, you slide. But what if you choose to do nothing? 

        The problem says: "your moves are west, west, west, south, east, north, west, and west". So we are forced to move in a direction. There is no option to standstill on icy land? 

        However, the problem says: "You can walk or standstill on any dry land without any problem". This implies that on icy land, you cannot standstill? 

        But the problem does not say that explicitly. 

        After reading the problem again: 
          "You can move to either one of the four directions (north, south, east, or west) in the board."

          Then for icy land: 
          "If you stand at cell (r, c) and decide to move on a particular direction, then you will move on that direction continuously until you reach a dry land or the border of the board."

        This implies that if you are on an icy land and you choose a direction, you slide. But what if you don't choose a direction? The problem does not specify. However, the goal is to visit all cells. How is a cell considered visited? 

        The problem says: "Cells in which you only passed through are also not considered as visited". So we must stop at the cell? 

        But note: we can stop at a border cell? Even if it's icy? Because we hit the border? 

        Actually, the problem says: "until you reach a dry land or the border". So when we hit the border, we stop. Therefore, we can stop at a border icy cell? 

        Therefore, we can visit a border icy cell by stopping at it? 

        So the requirement is:

          - For an interior cell (not border) that is icy: we cannot stop at it unless we start at it? But the problem does not say we can standstill on icy land? 

        However, if we start at an interior icy cell, we are forced to move? Then we leave the cell? So we don't actually stop at that cell? 

        The problem: "visiting" a cell requires that we stop at that cell? 

        The example: "From (1,1) ..." and the positions are given as the stopping positions. 

        Therefore, we must stop at the cell to count as visited.

        How to stop at an interior icy cell? Only if we start at it and do nothing? But the problem does not allow doing nothing? The moves are given as a sequence. 

        Actually, the problem does not specify that we have to make a move at every step. It says: "your moves are ...". So we are forced to make those moves. 

        Therefore, we cannot stop at an interior icy cell? 

        So we must convert every interior icy cell? But wait, then the problem becomes: we must have a dry land at every cell? That would be R*C changes? 

        That does not match the sample.

        Alternatively, we must be able to stop at every cell? 

        How can we stop at an interior icy cell? We cannot. Therefore, the only way to visit an interior icy cell is to convert it to dry land? 

        Then why the sample only changes one cell? 

        Actually, the sample has many icy cells. For example, row0 has four icy cells. If we change one cell (say row2, col2) to dry, then we still have row0, col0, col1, col2, col3 as icy? How do we visit row0, col0? 

        The problem says: we can start at row0, col0? Then we are forced to move? Then we leave. So we don't visit row0, col0? 

        The sample sequence for starting at row0, col0 (which is (1,1) in 1-indexed) then moves to (3,1) (which is row2, col0) and then to (4,1) (row3, col0) and then to (4,2) (row3, col1) and then back to (3,2) (row2, col1). 

        How do they get to row0, col0? They started there? Then they moved? So they were at row0, col0 at the first step? Then they leave? 

        The problem says: "visiting" at the first step? 

        The problem states: "your initial position" is the first visited cell? 

        So if we start at row0, col0, then we have visited row0, col0? 

        Then we do not need to stop at row0, col0 by standing still? We start there and that counts? 

        But note: the example of moves: 
            "your initial position is at cell (3,7) and your moves are west, west, west, south, east, north, west, and west, respectively. Then your positions are 
            (3,7) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,1) -> (6,1) -> (6,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (2,1)"

        The initial position is visited. Then after the first move (west) they end at (3,4) -> which is visited? 

        So we count the starting position and every stopping position.

        Therefore, if we start at a cell, we visit that cell. 

        Then the interior icy cells can be visited by starting at them? 

        But the problem says "regardless of your initial starting position". That means we must be able to visit all cells even if we start at ANY cell? 

        So if we start at an interior icy cell, we visit that cell? Then we can move away? But we must also visit the other cells? 

        However, if we start at an interior icy cell, we are forced to move? Then we leave? How do we come back? 

        To come back, we must stop at that cell? But we can only stop at dry land or border? 

        Therefore, we cannot stop at an interior icy cell if we are not starting there? 

        But if we start there, we are there at the beginning? Then we leave? Then we never come back? 

        So we have visited that cell? 

        Then why do we need dry lands at all? 

        The issue: if we start at an interior icy cell, we visit it and then leave. But what about the other cells? 

        The problem: we must visit every cell. 

        However, if we start at a particular cell, we can visit the entire board? 

        The problem says: "regardless of your initial starting position". That is, for every starting cell, there exists a sequence of moves that visits all cells? 

        But if we start at an interior icy cell, can we visit the entire board? 

        Consider a grid that has one dry land at (0,0) and the rest icy. Start at (1,1) (interior icy). 
          - We start at (1,1) -> visited (1,1).
          - Then we move north: we slide until the border? Then we hit (0,1). Then we move east? We slide to (0,2), then (0,3)... until the border. Then we move south? Then we slide to (1,3) and then to (2,3) and then ... 
          - How do we get to (0,0)? We are at (0,3) and we move west: we slide until (0,0)? But then we stop at (0,0) because we hit the border? So we do visit (0,0).

        But what about (2,0)? 

        Actually, we can design a sequence to cover the entire board? 

        However, the problem states that we must have at least one dry land in every row and column? 

        The sample input has row0 empty and we fixed it with one change? 

        But without any dry land in row0, we can still visit row0? 

        Because we can stop at the border? 

        Then why do we need dry lands? 

        Actually, the problem requires that we can change direction arbitrarily? 

        Without dry land, we can only move in straight lines? 

        But the problem: we are allowed to choose the moves arbitrarily? 

        However, when we are on an icy land, we are forced to slide until we hit a dry land or the border. Therefore, to change direction, we must be at a dry land? 

        Therefore, dry lands are necessary to change direction? 

        So to visit the entire board, we must be able to change direction at least at some points? 

        Therefore, the board must be such that we can reach any cell from any starting cell? 

        This suggests that the entire board must be connected? 

        But note: if there are no dry lands, then we can only move in straight lines? So we can only visit the entire row and entire column that we start in? 

        How do we move to a different row? 

        We start at (r0, c0). Then we move north: we slide to the border? Then we are at (0, c0). Then we move east: we slide to (0, c_max). Then we move south: we slide to (r_max, c_max). Then we move west: to (r_max,0). Then north: to (0,0). Then east: to (0, c0). 

        We have visited the borders? But how about an interior cell (r1, c1)? 

        We can only visit it if we start at it? 

        But the problem requires that we visit all cells regardless of the starting position. 

        Therefore, if we start at (r1, c1) (interior), then we can visit the entire board? 

        But without dry lands, we cannot change direction? 

        To get from (r1, c1) to (r2, c2) that is not in the same row or same column, we need to change direction? 

        Actually, we can do: 
          Move north until border (0, c1)
          Move east until (0, c2) 
          Move south until (r2, c2)

        Then we can? 

        Therefore, without any dry land, we can visit the entire board? 

        Then why the sample input requires one change? 

        Actually, the problem statement says: "What is the minimum number of cells you need to change to ensure that your goal can be achieved?"

        And the sample input:

          4 4
          ....
          .###
          ##..
          ###.

        Without changing any cell, can we visit all cells from any starting position? 

        Consider starting at (0,0). 
          We can visit the entire row0? By moving east: we slide to (0,3). Then we move south: from (0,3) we slide until we hit a dry land? row1, col3 is '#' -> so we stop at (1,3). 
          Then we can move west: from (1,3) we are on dry land? So we can move one step west to (1,2) (dry land) -> then one more west? (1,1): dry land? no, row1: ".###" -> row1, col0 is '.' -> so we slide west? from (1,1) we move west: we go to (1,0) and then border? So stop at (1,0). 
          Then move south: from (1,0) is icy -> slide south? row2, col0 is '#' -> stop at (2,0). 
          Then move east: row2: "##.." -> so row2, col0 is '#' -> we can move east to (2,1) (dry land) -> then east to (2,2): icy -> then slide to (2,3). 
          Then move south: from (2,3) -> slide to (3,3) (border? or dry land? row3: "###." -> col3 is '.' -> so we stop at (3,3) because the next row would be out of bounds? 
          Then move west: from (3,3) is icy -> slide west: row3, col0 is '#' -> but we have row3: "###." -> col0, col1, col2 are '#' -> so we stop at (3,0)? 

          Now, have we visited all cells? 

          We have visited:
            row0: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) -> but we only stopped at (0,0) and (0,3) (and (0,0) at start, and (0,3) by sliding east). What about (0,1) and (0,2)? 

          The problem: we count only the stopping positions? So we have not stopped at (0,1) and (0,2)? 

          How to stop at (0,1)? We would have to start there? But we started at (0,0). 

          Or, if we move west from (0,1) we would go to (0,0) -> but we cannot move west from (0,1) if we are not at (0,1)? 

          We were at (0,0) and then moved east: we slid to (0,3) -> we passed through (0,1) and (0,2) but did not stop there. 

          Therefore, we have not visited (0,1) and (0,2)? 

        So to visit (0,1) and (0,2), we must start at them? 

        But the problem says: "regardless of your initial starting position". 

        If we start at (0,0), we cannot visit (0,1) and (0,2) -> so it fails.

        If we start at (0,1), then we visit (0,1) at start. Then we move east: slide to (0,3). Then we move south to (1,3). Then we can move west: to (1,2) (dry land), then west to (1,1) (dry land), then west to (1,0) (border). Then south to (2,0). Then east to (2,1) and (2,2) (but (2,2) is icy -> slide to (2,3)). Then south to (3,3). Then west to (3,0). 

        Now, what about (0,2)? We visited it? 
          We started at (0,1) and then moved east: we passed through (0,2) but did not stop. 

        So (0,2) is not visited.

        Therefore, we must stop at (0,2)? How? Only by converting it to dry land? 

        Or by starting at (0,2)? 

        But if we start at (0,2), then we visit (0,2). Then move east: to (0,3). Then move south: to (1,3). Then move west: to (1,2) (dry land) -> then west to (1,1) and (1,0). Then south to (2,0). Then east to (2,1) and (2,2) (slides to (2,3)). Then south to (3,3). Then west to (3,0).

        Then we have not visited (0,0) and (0,1)? 

        So we see: we cannot visit all four cells in row0 with one starting position? 

        Therefore, the board without any change is not valid.

        What if we change (2,2) to dry land? Then the grid becomes:

          row0: "...."
          row1: ".###"
          row2: "###."   -> becomes "###." -> actually, we changed row2, col2 (which is the third row, third column) from '.' to '#' -> so row2: "## #." -> becomes "###."? Actually, we write: 
                row0: "...."
                row1: ".###"
                row2: "###."   -> now dry lands at col0, col1, col2 of row2.
                row3: "###."

          Now, let's try to start at (0,0) (row0, col0):

            We start at (0,0).
            Move south: we slide until we hit a dry land? 
                row0, col0: icy -> slide south: row1, col0: icy ('.') -> row2, col0: '#' -> stop at (2,0).
            Then move east: we are at dry land -> step to (2,1). 
            Then move east: to (2,2) (dry land). 
            Then move north: from (2,2) -> north: row1, col2 is '#' -> stop at (1,2).
            Then move west: from (1,2) (dry land) -> to (1,1) (dry land). 
            Then move north: from (1,1) -> north: row0, col1: icy -> slide north? we are at the top, so stop at (0,1).
            Then move east: from (0,1) -> slide east: to (0,3).
            Then move south: to (1,3) (dry land).
            Then move west: from (1,3) -> dry land -> step to (1,2). 
            Then move west: to (1,1). 
            Then move south: from (1,1) -> dry land -> step to (2,1) -> then south: from (2,1) -> dry land -> step to (3,1) -> then south: out of bound? 
                   Actually, we are at row3, col1 -> then move east: to (3,2) (dry land) -> then east: to (3,3) (dry land) -> then north: from (3,3) -> icy -> slide north? until row0, col3? 
                   But row0, col3 is icy, and we slide to the border? stop at (0,3). 
            Then we are missing (0,2) and (3,0)? 

          How to get (0,2)? 

          From (0,3), move west: we are at (0,2) (by sliding) -> but we don't stop? 

          How to stop at (0,2)? We must convert it? 

        But the sample says we only change one cell.

        Actually, the sample provided a sequence: 
          "SSENNWENSESSESWENWENWNE"

        for the changed grid, starting at (1,1) [which is (0,0) in 0-indexed] and visits all cells.

        Let me simulate the beginning:

          Start at (0,0) -> call this step0.

          Step1: 'S' -> south: from (0,0) icy -> slide south until dry land: row2, col0 (dry) -> stop at (2,0) -> visited: (0,0), (2,0).

          Step2: 'S' -> south: from (2,0) (dry) -> we can move one step south to (3,0) (dry) -> visited: (3,0).

          Step3: 'E' -> east: from (3,0) (dry) -> move east to (3,1) (dry) -> visited: (3,1).

          Step4: 'N' -> north: from (3,1) (dry) -> move north to (2,1) (dry) -> visited: (2,1).

          Step5: 'N' -> north: from (2,1) (dry) -> move north to (1,1) (dry) -> visited: (1,1).

          Step6: 'W' -> west: from (1,1) (dry) -> move west to (1,0) (icy) -> then slide west? but at (1,0) we are at the first column? so stop at (1,0)? 
                  Actually, the grid at row1: ".###" -> the first character is '.' -> so (1,0) is icy. Then we move west: we are at the border? So we stop at (1,0) -> visited: (1,0).

          Step7: 'E' -> east: from (1,0) (icy) -> move east: 
                  next cell: (1,1) -> dry land -> stop at (1,1) -> already visited.

          Step8: 'N' -> north: from (1,1) (dry) -> move north: (0,1) -> icy -> slide north? border? stop at (0,1) -> visited: (0,1).

          Step9: 'S' -> south: from (0,1) (icy) -> slide south until dry land: row1, col1 is '#' -> stop at (1,1) -> already visited.

          Step10: 'E' -> east: from (1,1) (dry) -> move east to (1,2) (dry) -> visited: (1,2).

          Step11: 'S' -> south: from (1,2) (dry) -> move south to (2,2) (dry) -> visited: (2,2).

          Step12: 'E' -> east: from (2,2) (dry) -> move east to (2,3) (icy) -> slide east until border? stop at (2,3) (border) -> visited: (2,3).

          Step13: 'S' -> south: from (2,3) (icy) -> move south: row3, col3 is '.' -> slide south? out of bound? so stop at (3,3) -> visited: (3,3).

          Step14: 'E' -> east: from (3,3) (dry) -> move east: out of bound? invalid? 

        The move 'E' at (3,3) cannot be done? 

        The sample sequence has more moves. 

        Actually, the sample sequence is: "SSENNWENSESSESWENWENWNE"

        Let me count: 
          SS ENN W E N S ESSE SW E N W E N W NE

        We did: 
          SS -> 2
          ENN -> 3 (total 5)
          W -> 6
          E -> 7
          N -> 8
          S -> 9
          ESSE -> 13
          then S (14), W (15), E (16), N (17), W (18), E (19), N (20), W (21), NE (23)

        It is long.

        Instead, the sample explanation says they visit: 
          (1,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (4,2) -> (3,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (4,3) -> (4,4) -> (4,3) -> (3,3) -> (3,4) -> (2,4) -> (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,4)

        They visit (2,4) and (3,4) -> but our grid is 4x4, so col4 doesn't exist.

        I see: the sample uses 1-indexed and the grid is 4x4, so columns are 1 to 4? 
          (1,1) is valid.
          (1,4) is the last column.

        But then (3,4) is row3, col4 -> which is the last cell.

        So they visit all cells.

        How do they visit (0,2) in 0-indexed (which is (1,3) in 1-indexed)? 
          They list: (1,3) -> which is row0, col2 in 0-indexed? 

        How do they get there? 
          They say: (2,3) -> (1,3) -> by moving north from (2,3) (row1, col2 in 0-indexed? wait, indexing is confusing).

        Let me use 0-indexed for the sample grid after change:

          row0: ['.','.', '.', '.']
          row1: ['.','#','#','#'] 
          row2: ['#','#','#','.'] 
          row3: ['#','#','#','.']   -> but the sample output has row3 as "###." -> so row3: ['#','#','#','.'].

        The sample sequence in 0-indexed:

          start at (0,0) (1,1 in 1-indexed).

          SS: south twice: 
              from (0,0) -> south: slide to (2,0) [dry land at row2,col0] -> then south: from (2,0) is dry -> step to (3,0) [dry].

          Then E: east: (3,0)->(3,1) [dry].

          Then N: north: (3,1)->(2,1) [dry].

          Then N: north: (2,1)->(1,1) [dry].

          Then W: west: (1,1) is dry -> step west to (1,0) [icy] -> then slide west? but col0 is the first column -> stop at (1,0).

          Then E: east: from (1,0) [icy] -> slide east: stop at (1,1) [dry].

          Then N: north: from (1,1) [dry] -> step north to (0,1) [icy] -> then slide north? border -> stop at (0,1) [border].

          Then S: south: from (0,1) [icy] -> slide south to (1,1) [dry].

          Then E: east: (1,1)->(1,2) [dry].
          then S: south: (1,2)->(2,2) [dry].
          then S: south: (2,2)->(3,2) [dry].
          then E: east: (3,2) is dry -> step east to (3,3) [icy] -> slide east? border -> stop at (3,3) [border].
          then S: south: from (3,3) -> out of bound? not valid.

        This does not match.

        Given the complexity, let us trust the known solution: 

          We must have at least one dry land in every row and every column. 

        Why is that sufficient? 

          - With at least one dry land in every row and every column, we can stop in every row and every column.
          - The dry lands allow us to change direction arbitrarily.

          And it is known that the minimum number of changes is:

             (# of empty rows) + (# of empty columns) - (maximum matching)

          where the bipartite graph is built between empty rows and empty columns, and an edge exists if the cell is icy.

        Therefore, we will implement that.

        Steps:

          Step1: Mark which rows are empty (have no dry land) and which columns are empty.

          Step2: Build a bipartite graph:

                  Left nodes: indices of empty rows (say we have A empty rows, indexed 0 to A-1)
                  Right nodes: indices of empty columns (B of them, indexed 0 to B-1)

                  For an empty row i (which is the original row index = r_i) and empty column j (original column index = c_j):
                         if grid[r_i][c_j] is '.', then we add an edge from i to j.

          Step3: Compute the maximum matching in this bipartite graph.

          Step4: Answer = A + B - (size of matching)

        Why is this the minimum changes? 

          - We need to cover all empty rows and empty columns.
          - If we convert a cell (r_i, c_j) that is icy to dry, then it covers row r_i and column c_j.
          - We want to cover as many rows and columns as possible with one change -> maximum matching.

        The sample:

          emptyRows: [0]   (only row0 is empty)
          emptyCols: []    (no empty column)

          Then answer = 1 + 0 - 0 = 1.

        Why are there no empty columns? 

          Columns:

            col0: has dry land at row2 and row3 -> not empty.
            col1: has dry land at row1, row2, row3 -> not empty.
            col2: has dry land at row1, row2, row3? 
                   row0: '.' -> not dry.
                   row1: '#' -> dry.
            col3: has dry land at row1? -> dry.

          Therefore, no empty column.

          So we only have one empty row -> we need one change in that row? 

          But the change must be in a cell that is currently icy? And we can choose any cell in row0? 

          Why not change row0, col0 to dry land? 

          Then row0 is not empty. And we have covered the empty row.

          But then the sample changed row2, col2? 

          The sample changed a cell that is in an empty row? -> row0 is empty, but row2 is not empty.

          This is the catch: the bipartite graph only considers cells that are at the intersection of an empty row and an empty column. 

          In the sample, there is no empty column, so there is no edge in the bipartite graph. 

          Then we cover the empty row by converting any cell in that row to dry land. 

          But why choose row0, col0? 

          However, the sample changed row2, col2? That is not in an empty row? 

          That means the known solution might be more general: 

          We only consider empty rows and empty columns? 

          But if a row is not empty, then we don't need to cover it? 

          And if a column is not empty, we don't need to cover it? 

          Then why change a cell that is not in an empty row or empty column? 

          The sample input: after changing row2, col2, which is not in an empty row and not in an empty column, we solve the problem.

          This implies that the condition "every row and every column must have at least one dry land" is not necessary? 

        Let me reevaluate the condition: 

          We require that regardless of the starting position, we can visit all cells.

          The known solution in the competitive programming community for this problem (which is known as "Skating" in some contests) is to use the bipartite matching on empty rows and empty columns.

          And the sample output is 1.

          And the sample input has one empty row and no empty column, so the answer is 1.

          But the sample change is not in the empty row? 

          How can changing a cell outside the empty row cover the empty row? 

        I see the flaw: 

          In the sample, after changing row2, col2 to dry land, the grid becomes:

            row0: "...."   -> still no dry land -> empty row.
            row1: ".###"   -> not empty.
            row2: "###."   -> now has dry land in col0, col1, col2 -> not empty.
            row3: "###."   -> not empty.

          Then we still have one empty row. 

          But the sample says it works.

        This means that the condition is not as simple as having a dry land in every row and column. 

        After research, I recall a known problem: 
          "In a grid with slides, to have the entire board connected in the directed graph of moves, we need to have a dry land in every row and every column? 

        Actually, the known solution for the exact problem (minimum changes to ensure connectivity from any start) is the bipartite matching between empty rows and empty columns, and the answer is A+B - matching.

        But why then in the sample we changed a cell not in the empty row? 

        Let me reexamine the bipartite graph construction:

          We only consider cells that are in an empty row AND empty column? 

          In the sample, there is no empty column, so we don't add any edge. 

          Then we cover the empty row by a change in that row? 

          But the sample change was in row2, col2 -> which is not in an empty row and not in an empty column.

        Therefore, the known solution does not change a cell in an empty row? 

        This is a contradiction.

        I see the problem: the known solution changes a cell in the empty row? 

        But the sample output grid: 
            ....
            .###
            ###.   -> the third row has dry lands in the first three columns.
            ###.

        How does this cover the empty row (row0)? 

        It doesn't put a dry land in row0.

        Therefore, the condition might be that even if a row is empty, we don't require a dry land in that row if we can stop at the border? 

        But then how to change direction? 

        After reading a known solution for a similar problem (CodeForces "Skating"), the solution is indeed:

          Let R = set of rows that have at least one dry land.
          Let C = set of columns that have at least one dry land.

          Then, we require that the entire board must be connected by the dry lands and the borders? 

          But the problem is not about connectivity of the dry lands.

        Alternatively, the known solution in the sample code we provided earlier does:

          - Count empty rows and empty columns.
          - Build bipartite graph only on the intersections of empty rows and empty columns.

          And then output A+B - matching.

        And the sample input: 
            R=4, C=4
            Grid:
                "...."
                ".###"
                "##.."
                "###."

          emptyRows: only row0 -> A=1.
          emptyCols: none -> B=0.
          matching = 0.
          Answer = 1.

        But the sample change is in row2, col2 -> which is not in row0.

        How does that change help for row0? 

        The change in row2, col2 might be to allow a path that visits the entire board including row0? 

        But without a dry land in row0, we cannot stop in row0 to change direction? 

        However, the sample sequence shows that they visited row0 by starting elsewhere.

        The known solution does not require that we have a dry land in every row and every column, but rather than the structure of dry lands must be such that every row and every column is "covered" in the sense that there is a dry land in the row or the row is not needed to have one because we can use the matching? 

        Given the complexity, we will implement the solution as described in the editorial guidelines.

        Steps in code:

          1. Read R, C and grid.
          2. Create two boolean arrays: 
               rowEmpty[0..R-1]: initially true. For a row i, if we find at least one '#', set rowEmpty[i]=false.
               colEmpty[0..C-1]: initially true. For a column j, if we find at least one '#', set colEmpty[j]=false.
          3. Collect:
               emptyRows: all i such that rowEmpty[i] is true.
               emptyCols: all j such that colEmpty[j] is true.
          4. Let A = emptyRows.size(), B = emptyCols.size().
          5. Build a bipartite graph for left set [0, A-1] and right set [0, B-1]:
                 For i in [0, A-1]:
                    r = emptyRows[i]
                    For j in [0, B-1]:
                         c = emptyCols[j]
                         if grid[r][c] == '.', then add edge from i to j.
          6. Find maximum matching in the bipartite graph (using DFS).
          7. Answer = A + B - (size of matching)

        We'll run this for the sample: it gives 1.

        We also have a sample that might have both empty rows and empty columns.

        Consider a grid:
          2 2
          ..
          ..
        Then: 
          emptyRows: [0,1] -> A=2.
          emptyCols: [0,1] -> B=2.
          The grid is all '.'.
          We build graph: 
              left nodes: 0 (row0), 1 (row1)
              right nodes: 0 (col0), 1 (col1)
              edges: 
                  from left0 (row0) to right0 (col0): '.' -> edge 0->0
                  from left0 (row0) to right1 (col1): '.' -> edge 0->1
                  from left1 (row1) to right0 (col0): '.' -> edge 1->0
                  from left1 (row1) to right1 (col1): '.' -> edge 1->1

          Maximum matching: we can match 0->0 and 1->1, so matching=2.

          Answer = 2+2-2 = 2.

        But is 2 the minimum? We must change two cells: for instance, (0,0) and (1,1) -> then the grid:
             '#.'
             '.#'
          Now, row0: has a dry land -> not empty.
                row1: has a dry land -> not empty.
                col0: has a dry land -> not empty.
                col1: has a dry land -> not empty.

        Or we can change (0,0) and (0,1) -> then row0 is not empty, but col0 and col1 are not empty (because row0 has two dry lands) -> and row1 is empty? 
          row1: no dry land -> empty -> then we still need to cover row1? 

        We would have to change one cell in row1 -> total 3 changes.

        But if we change two cells: (0,0) and (1,1), then we cover both rows and both columns.

        So 2 changes are sufficient.

        Therefore, the solution works for this.

        Another example: 
          2 2
          .#
          #.
          -> 
          row0: has '#' at col1 -> not empty.
          row1: has '#' at col0 -> not empty.
          col0: has '#' at row1 -> not empty.
          col1: has '#' at row0 -> not empty.
          Then emptyRows = 0, emptyCols=0 -> answer=0.

        And indeed, we don't need to change any cell.

        Given the above, we trust the solution.

        Let's code accordingly.

        Note: the grid dimensions R, C up to 500 -> the bipartite graph has at most 500 nodes on left and 500 on right -> we can do DFS matching.

        Steps for matching (bipartite matching for left set [0, A-1] and right set [0, B-1]):

          matchR[j] = which left node is matched to right node j, or -1 if not matched.

          for each left node u in [0, A-1]:
               seen = array of booleans of size B (for the right nodes) for the current DFS, reset for each u.
               run dfs(u): for each neighbor v of u, if not seen[v], mark seen[v]=true, then if v is not matched or if the current match of v can be rematched, then match u to v.

        Then count the number of matches.

        We output A+B - matching.

        Let me test with the sample 2x2 all '.'.

          A=2, B=2.
          Graph:
            left0: [0,1] (edges to right0 and right1)
            left1: [0,1] 
          Matching:

            For u=0:
                try v=0: 
                    seen[0]=true.
                    matchR[0] is -1 -> so matchR[0]=0 -> matchingCount=1.
                then try v=1: skip because we already matched.

            For u=1:
                try v=0: 
                    seen[0]=true -> then check matchR[0]=0, then we try dfs(0) for rematching? 
                    in dfs(0): we will try the neighbors of 0: which are [0,1] for left0? 
                    then we try v=0: seen[0] is already true -> skip.
                    then we try v=1: not seen -> mark seen[1]=true, then matchR[1] is -1 -> then we can match left0 to right1? 
                    but wait: we are in the DFS for u=1, and we are trying to rematch for v=0 which is currently matched to u=0.

                    Actually, the DFS in the matching for u=1:

                      We look at v=0: 
                         if we can reassign the current match of v=0 (which is left0) to another right node, then we can assign v=0 to u=1.

                      We do: 
                         seen[0]=true -> then we go to matchR[0]=0, and then call dfs(0) for the current seen array? 

                      In dfs(0) (for left0), we try the neighbors of left0: [0,1]. 
                         v=0: seen[0] is true -> skip.
                         v=1: not seen -> mark seen[1]=true.
                                 matchR[1] is -1 -> so we can match left0 to right1? 
                                 Then we set matchR[1]=0, and return true.

                      Then we set matchR[0] = 1 (because we are matching u=1 to v=0) -> and return true.

                    Then we have two matches: 
                         left0 -> right1
                         left1 -> right0

                    So matchingCount=2.

            Therefore, answer = 2+2-2 = 2.

        So it works.

        We'll code accordingly.

        Note: The grid is given as R rows of C characters.

        Let's write the code accordingly.

        Important: 
          We use 0-indexed for rows and columns.

        We'll define:
          const int MAX = 505;

        Steps:

          Read R and C.
          for i from 0 to R-1: cin >> grid[i]

          bool rowEmpty[MAX], colEmpty[MAX];
          memset(rowEmpty, true, sizeof(rowEmpty));
          memset(colEmpty, true, sizeof(colEmpty));

          for i from 0 to R-1:
            for j from 0 to C-1:
               if grid[i][j]=='#':
                  rowEmpty[i]=false;
                  colEmpty[j]=false;

          vector<int> emptyRows, emptyCols;
          for i: if rowEmpty[i] then push i.
          for j: if colEmpty[j] then push j.

          A = emptyRows.size(), B = emptyCols.size();

          vector<int> graph[A];   // or graph[MAX] but we only need A nodes on left.

          But note: A might be 0 -> then we skip.

          For i in 0 to A-1:
             r = emptyRows[i]
             For j in 0 to B-1:
                 c = emptyCols[j]
                 if grid[r][c]=='.' then graph[i].push_back(j)

          Then we do bipartite matching for left set [0, A-1] and right set [0, B-1].

          We'll have an array for matchR: for each right node j, the left node matched to j, or -1.

          int matchR[B]; -> but we can have at most 500, so we do matchR[MAX] (with size MAX, but we only use indices 0..B-1).

          Then for u in [0, A-1]:
               bool seen[B]; -> but we can use a global seen of size MAX, and reset for each u.

          We do:

            int matchingCount = 0;
            fill(matchR, matchR+B, -1);   // for j in [0, B-1] matchR[j] = -1.

            for (int u = 0; u < A; u++) {
                // reset seen for the right nodes: [0, B-1] to false.
                bool seen_local[MAX] = {false};   // or we can use a global seen and reset with memset for each u.
                if (dfs(u, seen_local, graph, matchR)) 
                    matchingCount++;
            }

          But note: the DFS function:

          bool dfs(int u, bool seen[], vector<int> graph[], int matchR[]) {
            for each v in graph[u]:
                if (!seen[v]) {
                    seen[v] = true;
                    if (matchR[v] < 0 || dfs(matchR[v], seen, graph, matchR)) {
                        matchR[v] = u;
                        return true;
                    }
                }
            }
            return false;
          }

        However, we cannot reset a local seen array and then pass by value? We should reset for each u.

        Alternatively, we can have:

          bool seen[MAX];
          for (int u = 0; u < A; u++) {
              memset(seen, 0, sizeof(seen));
              if (dfs(u, seen, graph, matchR)) 
                 matchingCount++;
          }

        And the DFS uses the same seen array for the entire recursion for one u.

        But note: we want the seen array to be for the current DFS tree for u.

        This is the standard algorithm.

        We'll do:

          int matchR[MAX];  // for the entire right set, size MAX, we use indices 0 to B-1.

          Then:

          matchingCount = 0;
          for (int j=0; j<B; j++) matchR[j] = -1;

          for (int u=0; u<A; u++) {
              memset(seen, false, sizeof(seen));
              if (dfs(u, seen, graph, matchR)) 
                  matchingCount++;
          }

        Then answer = A + B - matchingCount.

        Print answer.

        Let me test on the sample 4x4: 
          A=1, B=0 -> then matchingCount=0 -> answer=1.

        It matches.

        We'll code accordingly.

        Note: We assume that the grid is stored in an array of strings.

        Let me run on a small example: 1x1 grid [['.']]
          Then row0 is empty? -> yes, because no '#' -> A=1.
          col0 is empty? -> yes, B=1.
          Then we build graph: 
              only node: left0 (row0) and right0 (col0)
              grid[0][0]=='.' -> so edge from 0 to 0.
          Matching: 
            u=0: 
                v=0: not seen -> mark seen[0]=true.
                      matchR[0] is -1 -> so set matchR[0]=0 -> return true -> matchingCount=1.
            Then answer = 1+1-1 = 1.

        And indeed, we need to change one cell.

        Another example: 1x1 grid [['#']] 
          Then row0 is not empty, col0 is not empty -> A=0, B=0 -> answer=0.

        So it works.

        We'll code accordingly.

        However, note: the grid might be up to 500x500 -> the bipartite graph has at most 500 nodes on the left and 500 on the right, and each node can have up to 500 edges -> worst-case 500*500 = 250000 edges -> which is acceptable.

        Let me code accordingly.

        Important: when building the graph, we iterate over emptyRows and emptyCols.

        Note: the grid indices: 
            row index r = emptyRows[i] is the original row index.
            col index c = emptyCols[j] is the original col index.

        We then check grid[r][c].

        We assume the grid is stored as:
            char grid[MAX][MAX];   // but we read R and C, and then R lines.

        We can do:

          const int MAX = 505;
          char grid[MAX][MAX];

          Then read:

          cin >> R >> C;
          for (int i=0; i<R; i++) {
              cin >> grid[i];
          }

        Then proceed.

        Code accordingly.

        Let me submit.

        Note: The problem states that the board has R rows and C columns.

        We'll use:

          #include <iostream>
          #include <vector>
          #include <cstring>
          using namespace std;

        And then the code as above.

        We'll use MAX = 505.

        We assume R, C <= 500.

        We'll write the DFS function.

        Note: the DFS function is for the bipartite matching.

        Let me write the DFS as a separate function.

        Alternatively, we can write it inside the main? Or as a helper.

        We'll write:

          bool dfs(int u, bool seen[], vector<int> graph[], int matchR[]) {
            for (int idx=0; idx<graph[u].size(); idx++) {
                int v = graph[u][idx];
                if (!seen[v]) {
                    seen[v] = true;
                    if (matchR[v] == -1 || dfs(matchR[v], seen, graph, matchR)) {
                        matchR[v] = u;
                        return true;
                    }
                }
            }
            return false;
          }

        However, note: we are using a global seen array for one DFS call? But we reset it for each u.

        But the recursion: if we call dfs for matchR[v], then we are using the same seen array? That is intentional: we don't want to visit the same right node twice in one DFS.

        That is the standard algorithm.

        We'll do.

        But note: the graph is stored as vector<int> graph[MAX] -> graph[u] is a vector of v (right node indices) for left node u.

        We'll declare: vector<int> graph[MAX];   // MAX is 505, so we have up to 500 vectors.

        Then we build the graph for u in [0, A-1] (which are the indices of the empty rows).

        We note: A = emptyRows.size(), and the left nodes are from 0 to A-1.

        Similarly, the right nodes are from 0 to B-1.

        We'll run the matching only for these.

        Let me write the entire code.

        Note: We must be cautious: the matchR array is for the right nodes (0 to B-1). 

        We declare: 
          int matchR[MAX];   // for each right node j in [0, B-1], we store the left node that matches to j.

        And we initialize matchR for j in [0, MAX-1]? But we only care about [0, B-1]. We initialize to -1.

        Then we do:

          for (int u=0; u<A; u++) {
              memset(seen, false, sizeof(seen));   // seen is an array of MAX booleans? 
              if (dfs(u, seen, graph, matchR)) 
                  matchingCount++;
          }

        However, the DFS function:

          bool dfs(int u, bool seen[], vector<int> graph[], int matchR[]) {
            for (int v : graph[u]) {
                if (!seen[v]) {
                    seen[v] = true;
                    if (matchR[v] == -1 || dfs(matchR[v], seen, graph, matchR)) {
                        matchR[v] = u;
                        return true;
                    }
                }
            }
            return false;
          }

        But note: the seen array must be of size at least B. We have seen[MAX] in the main? Then we pass the same seen array.

        We can declare:

          bool seen[MAX];   // globally? or inside main.

        We'll declare inside main: 
          bool seen[MAX];   // we use this for each DFS.

        Then:

          for (int u=0; u<A; u++) {
              memset(seen, 0, sizeof(seen));   // sizeof(seen) is MAX * sizeof(bool) -> but we only care about indices 0 to B-1? 
              if (dfs(u, seen, graph, matchR)) 
                  matchingCount++;
          }

        The DFS function only checks v that are in the graph, which are in the range [0, B-1]? 

        And we have B<=500, so MAX=505 is enough.

        We'll run.

        Let me test with 2x2 grid with two empty rows and two empty columns, and grid all '.'.

        We'll run the DFS and see if it matches two.

        Due to time, we trust the algorithm.

        Code accordingly.

        Output the answer.

        Let me run the provided sample: 
          4 4
          ....
          .###
          ##..
          ###.

        Then emptyRows: [0] -> A=1.
        emptyCols: [] -> B=0.

        Then we build graph: for i=0 to A-1 (which is 0) -> then for j=0 to B-1 (which is none) -> no edges.

        Then matchingCount=0.

        Answer = 1+0-0 = 1.

        So output 1.

        Therefore, it matches.

        We submit.
