We are given an undirected graph G with N nodes and M edges. We want to find the maximum integer k such that there exists an ordering L of the non-edges (i.e., the pairs of nodes not already connected by an edge) for which, when we process the non-edges in order L, we add an edge (a, b) if and only if (at the moment of processing) the sum of the degrees of a and b is at least k. Moreover, after processing, the graph becomes complete (i.e., we have added every non-edge as an edge).

Note: The degrees change as we add edges.

We are to output the maximum k for which this is possible.

Observations:

1. The problem is equivalent to: we are going to add all the non-edges in some order. For a candidate k, we require that for every non-edge (a, b) we must at some point have deg(a) + deg(b) >= k. However, note that the degrees increase as we add edges, so we might be able to add an edge later even if initially the degree sum is below k.

2. The key is that we can choose the order arbitrarily. Therefore, we are allowed to postpone adding an edge until the degrees of its endpoints have increased sufficiently.

3. We note that the entire graph becomes complete at the end, so the final degree of every node is (N-1). However, during the process, the degrees are increasing.

4. Consider the following: 
   - If we set k too high, then there might be a non-edge (a, b) for which, even at the end, the degree sum is (N-1)+(N-1)=2*(N-1). But note: we can set k as high as 2*(N-1) and that would be acceptable for the last edge? However, we have to consider that we might need to add edges in an order that increases the degrees appropriately.

5. Actually, the problem is to find the maximum k such that there exists an ordering that adds every non-edge. How can we characterize such a k?

We can use the following known result from graph theory (related to the concept of "graph closure" and the well-known Havel-Hakimi algorithm):

Theorem (Bondy and Chvatal): 
  A graph G can be completed to a complete graph by iteratively adding an edge between two non-adjacent vertices with degree sum at least k (for a fixed k) if and only if the k-closure of G is the complete graph.

But note: the k-closure of a graph is the graph obtained by repeatedly adding edges between non-adjacent vertices with degree sum at least k until no more can be added. However, in our problem the order of adding edges is arbitrary? But note: the theorem actually states that if we repeatedly add an edge between ANY non-adjacent pair with degree sum at least k (in any order) until we can't add any more, then the resulting graph (the closure) is well-defined (it doesn't depend on the order). 

But our problem is different: we are forced to add every non-edge. We are allowed to choose the order arbitrarily, and we are allowed to add an edge even if at the moment we process it the condition holds, and we can postpone an edge until later when the degrees have increased.

Therefore, the problem reduces to: we want to add all the non-edges. The condition for an edge (a, b) is that at the time we add it, deg(a) + deg(b) >= k.

We note that if we can achieve adding every non-edge, then the closure (with parameter k) must be the complete graph. However, the closure (with parameter k) is defined as the graph we get by repeatedly adding edges (without any particular order) as long as there is a non-edge with degree sum >= k. Therefore, if the k-closure of G is the complete graph, then we can certainly add all the edges (because the closure process will eventually add all the edges). But note: the closure process doesn't necessarily add the edges in the order we choose arbitrarily? Actually, the theorem says that the closure is well defined and independent of the order. Therefore, if the closure is complete, then there is an order (in fact any order that always picks an available edge) that will add all the edges.

Moreover, if the k-closure is not complete, then no matter what order we choose, we will get stuck: there will be a non-edge that we cannot add because at the time we try to add it (and after having added as many as we can) the degree sum is less than k. But note: our process is forced to consider every non-edge? However, we can choose the order arbitrarily. The closure process is a greedy process that adds edges as long as the condition holds. If the closure is not complete, then there is a set of non-edges that remain and that in the closure graph, for every non-edge (a,b) in that set, deg(a) + deg(b) < k. Then, no matter what order we use, if we leave such an edge to the end, then at the time we process it, the degrees of a and b might be the same as in the closure (since no edge incident to a or b that is not present has been added) and hence the condition fails.

Therefore, the condition that the k-closure of G is the complete graph is necessary and sufficient for the existence of an ordering that completes the graph.

But note: the problem asks for the maximum k such that there exists an ordering that completes the graph. 

So we can reframe the problem: find the maximum k such that the k-closure of G is the complete graph.

How do we compute the k-closure? 

The closure for a fixed k is computed by:
  Start with G.
  While there exists a non-edge (a,b) such that deg(a) + deg(b) >= k, add the edge (a,b) (and update the degrees).

We then check if the resulting graph is complete.

But note: k is the parameter we are trying to maximize. We are going to try to find the maximum k for which the closure is complete.

We note:

- k cannot exceed 2*(N-1) (because the maximum degree of a node is N-1). 

- k must be at least 0 (as in sample input 2).

How can we find the maximum k? 

We can try to simulate the closure for candidate k's? But k can be in the range [0, 2*(N-1)] and N is at most 500, so we could try all possible k? That would be about 1000 * (simulating the closure for a fixed k). How expensive is simulating the closure?

In the closure simulation for a fixed k, we start with the given graph and then repeatedly add an edge between any non-adjacent pair (a, b) that has deg(a)+deg(b) >= k. We can use a priority queue: we keep a max-heap for the degree sums of non-edges? But note: as we add an edge, the degrees of a and b increase, which might make other non-edges incident to a or b now satisfy the condition.

However, the number of non-edges initially is O(N^2) which is about 125000 for N=500. The closure process might add all the non-edges (if k is low enough) and each addition might require updating the degrees and the degree sums for all the non-edges incident to a and b. This update per edge is O(N). The total would be O(N^3) per candidate k. And we have about 1000 candidate k's? That would be 1000 * 125e6 operations which is 125e9, too slow.

We need a better approach.

Alternative Insight:

The problem is equivalent to: we want the maximum k such that the k-closure of G is the complete graph.

It is known that the closure for k = t is the same for a range of t. In fact, the closure only changes when t crosses a critical value. Moreover, the closure is a monotonic function of t: as t decreases, the closure can only get larger (more edges added). Therefore, we can binary search on k.

But note: we are looking for the maximum k for which the closure is complete. Since as k decreases, it's easier for the closure to be complete (because we require lower degree sums to add an edge), then the closure being complete is a monotonic property: if k0 works, then every k <= k0 also works? Actually, no: if k0 works then the closure for k0 is complete. For any k' < k0, the closure for k' is at least as large as the closure for k0 (because we have a lower threshold, so we add at least as many edges). Therefore, if the closure for k0 is complete, then for k'<k0, the closure is also complete. 

But we want the maximum k for which the closure is complete. So we can binary search on k in the range [0, 2*(N-1)] to find the maximum k such that the closure of G for k is complete.

However, note: the closure for k0 being complete does not necessarily imply that the closure for k0+1 is not complete. Actually, if the closure for k0 is complete, then for any k <= k0, the closure is complete. Therefore, the set of k for which the closure is complete is an interval [0, k_max]? Then k_max is the maximum k we are looking for.

But wait: we are looking for the maximum k such that the closure is complete. However, if k is too large (like k_max+1) then the closure might not be complete. Therefore, k_max is the threshold.

But note: the closure for k_max might be complete, and for k_max+1 it might not be. So we are looking for the maximum k such that the closure is complete. This is equivalent to: k_max = max { k : closure_k(G) is complete }.

We can do a linear scan from k = 2*(N-1) down to 0 and stop at the first k for which the closure is complete. But worst-case k from 1000 down to 0, and for each k we do an O(N^3) closure simulation? That would be 1000 * 125e6 = 125e9 operations, which is too slow for 1 second (especially in Python, but even in C++ it is borderline? But note N=500, and the number of edges we add is O(N^2)=250000, and each edge addition we update O(N) non-edges? Then 250000*500 = 125e6 per candidate k. Then 1000 * 125e6 = 125e9, which is too slow.

We need a more efficient way to compute the closure for a fixed k.

Known efficient algorithm for the closure:

We can use a strategy similar to the Havel-Hakimi algorithm? Actually, we can use a greedy algorithm:

  Let deg[i] be the current degree of node i.
  We maintain a list of non-edges? But we don't have to store them all explicitly.

Alternatively, we can use a well-known method: 

  While there is a non-edge (a,b) with deg(a)+deg(b) >= k:
      We choose the pair (a,b) that maximizes deg(a)+deg(b) (or any pair) and add that edge, then update deg(a) and deg(b), and also update the degree sums for non-edges incident to a and b.

But how to quickly find a non-edge (a,b) with deg(a)+deg(b)>=k? 

We can do:

  Use a priority queue for each vertex? Actually, we can use a global priority queue that stores for each non-edge (a,b) the value deg(a)+deg(b). But when we add an edge, we update the degrees of a and b, and then we must update the degree sums for every non-edge incident to a and to b. Each update might require updating the priority queue. The total number of non-edges is O(N^2) and each update is O(log(N^2)) = O(log N). The total number of updates: each edge addition causes O(N) updates (because we update the non-edges incident to a and to b, which are O(N) each). The total edges we add is O(N^2). So the total operations would be O(N^3 * log N). For N=500, N^3 = 125e6, and multiplied by log(500) which is about 9, so about 1.125e9 operations. This might be acceptable in C++ but in Python? The problem time limit is 1 second. We must be cautious.

Alternatively, we can use a different approach: 

  We can use a bucket for the degree sums? 

But note: the degree sums can be as large as 2*(N-1) and then as we add edges, they can go up to 2*(N-1). The number of buckets is about 2*N, which is 1000.

We can maintain:

  For each vertex i, we maintain the current degree: deg[i].
  We maintain an adjacency matrix (or adjacency list) to quickly check if an edge exists.

  We also maintain, for each vertex i, a list of non-neighbors j (with j>i?) and then for each non-neighbor j, we have the value deg[i]+deg[j]. 

  We maintain a global priority queue? Or we can maintain for each vertex i, the maximum deg[i]+deg[j] for j not adjacent to i. Then the global maximum is the maximum over i of that value? 

But note: we are only interested in non-edges (i,j). 

Actually, we can maintain a data structure that holds the maximum degree sum for non-edges. We can do:

  Let's have a global multiset (or priority queue) that contains, for every non-edge (i,j), the value deg[i]+deg[j]. 

  Then the condition: is the maximum value in the multiset >= k? 

  Steps:
      While the multiset is not empty and the maximum value in the multiset is >= k:
          Pop a non-edge (i,j) with the maximum value? (But note: we can pop any non-edge with value>=k, but if we pop the maximum, we might avoid some updates? Actually, it doesn't matter which one we pop as long as the condition holds. The closure is independent of order? Actually, the theorem says the closure is independent of the order. So we can choose the non-edge with the maximum degree sum.

      However, when we add an edge (i,j), we update:
          deg[i]++ and deg[j]++.
          Then, for every other non-edge incident to i, say (i, x) (where x is not adjacent to i), the old value was deg[i] (before update) + deg[x]. Now it becomes (deg[i]+1)+deg[x]. Similarly for j.

      So we must update every non-edge incident to i and every non-edge incident to j. 

      How to update the multiset? 
          We remove the old entries for (i,x) and (j,x) for every x that is currently a non-neighbor of i and j, respectively, and then insert new entries with the updated degree sum.

      But note: when we add (i,j), then (i,j) becomes an edge so we remove it from the multiset.

      Also, note: after adding (i,j), the non-edges incident to i: we must update every non-edge (i,x) for x not adjacent to i (and similarly for j). 

      How do we iterate over non-neighbors? We can maintain for each vertex a list of non-neighbors? The total number of non-edges is O(N^2). 

      The cost per edge addition: 
          Removing the non-edge (i,j): O(log |E|) in the multiset.
          Then, for i: we iterate over all x that are currently non-neighbors of i? But note: the non-neighbors of i are stored in a set or list. The number of non-neighbors is O(N). Similarly for j. For each such x, we remove the non-edge (min(i,x), max(i,x)) from the multiset? And then we recalculate the new value (which is (deg[i]+1) + deg[x] for (i,x)) and then insert. Then we update the non-neighbor structure: we mark that i and j are now adjacent, so we remove j from i's non-neighbors and i from j's non-neighbors? Actually, we just added the edge (i,j), so we remove each other from their non-neighbor sets.

      But note: when updating (i,x) we must also consider that x might be adjacent to i? Actually, we are iterating only over non-neighbors. 

      Steps for adding (i,j):
          Remove the non-edge (i,j) from the multiset and from the non-neighbor sets? Actually, we are going to add the edge so we remove the non-edge.
          Then, for each non-neighbor x of i (including j? but j is now an edge so we skip j? Actually, we remove j from i's non-neighbor set and vice versa) we update the non-edge (i,x): 
              We remove the old entry for (i,x): which was deg_old[i] + deg[x].
              Then we update the non-edge (i,x) to (deg_old[i]+1) + deg[x]? But note: we haven't updated deg[i] yet? Actually, we do:

          We do:
            deg[i] = deg_old[i] + 1
            deg[j] = deg_old[j] + 1

          Then for every non-neighbor x of i (excluding j) and for every non-neighbor x of j (excluding i), we remove the old non-edge and then insert the new one.

      However, note: when we update deg[i] and deg[j], then the non-edges incident to i and j are affected. But note: for a non-edge (i,x), the new value is deg[i] (which is old_deg[i]+1) + deg[x]. Similarly for j.

      Also note: the non-edges that are not incident to i or j are unaffected.

      But we must be cautious: when we update the degree of i, then the non-edge (x,y) that is not incident to i or j remains unchanged.

      Implementation:
          We maintain:
            deg: list of current degrees.
            adj: an adjacency matrix (or set of sets) for the graph (current graph: initial graph + added edges). Alternatively, we can use a boolean matrix. Since N=500, a 500x500 matrix is acceptable (250000 booleans).

          non_edges: we don't need to store all, but we do need to store the non-neighbor sets for each vertex? 
          Let non_neighbor[i] = set of j such that j>i and (i,j) is not an edge? Or we can just use a set per vertex for non-neighbors? Actually, we can maintain:

            non_neighbors[i] = set of vertices j (j != i) that are not adjacent to i.

          We also maintain a global multiset (or priority queue) that stores (value, i, j) for each non-edge (i,j) (with i<j). We need to update the values when degrees change.

      The algorithm for a fixed k:

        Initialize:
          deg = initial degrees (from the input graph)
          adj = a 2D boolean list (or we can use a set of edges) and we mark the initial edges.
          non_neighbors: for each i, we start with all j != i that are not adjacent. We can build this by: for i from 1 to N, non_neighbors[i] = { j | j != i and (i,j) not in the initial graph }.

          multiset: initially, for every non-edge (i,j) (with i<j), we add the value = deg[i] + deg[j].

        Then, while the multiset is not empty and the maximum value in the multiset >= k:
            Pop the non-edge (i,j) with the largest value? Actually, we can pop any non-edge with value>=k. But to avoid updating too many, we can pop the one with the largest value? But note: the theorem says the closure is independent of order. So we can choose arbitrarily. However, if we choose an arbitrary one, we might update the same vertex multiple times. Choosing the largest might be efficient? 

            However, we are going to update the degrees of i and j. Then we update the non-edges incident to i and j. 

            Steps:
                Remove (i,j) from the multiset and then add the edge (i,j) to the graph. 
                Remove j from non_neighbors[i] and i from non_neighbors[j].
                Increase deg[i] by 1 and deg[j] by 1.

                Then, for every non-neighbor x of i (which does not include j anymore): 
                    Remove the non-edge (i,x) from the multiset (because we are going to update its value). 
                    Then, the new value for (i,x) is deg[i] (which is now old_deg[i]+1) + deg[x]. Then insert the new value for (i,x) into the multiset.

                Similarly for j: for every non-neighbor x of j (which does not include i):
                    Remove the non-edge (j,x) from the multiset.
                    Then insert the new value = deg[j] + deg[x].

                But note: if we are using a priority queue that doesn't support removal, we might use a lazy deletion? 

            Alternatively, we can avoid removing the old entries and just insert the new ones. Then we have multiple entries for the same non-edge. But we can mark the non-edge as active? And when we pop a non-edge, we check if it is still active (i.e., it exists and the value we have is the current one). This lazy method is common in priority queues.

        After we cannot add any more edges, we check if the graph is complete: if the total edges is N*(N-1)/2.

        But note: we started with M edges and we added some. The closure process stops when there is no non-edge with deg(a)+deg(b)>=k. Then we check if we have added all non-edges? Actually, we stop when we cannot add any more. Then if the graph is complete, we return that k is valid.

        However, we are simulating the closure for a fixed k. We break when the maximum value in the multiset is < k. Then we check the total number of edges.

        The total number of edges we have at the end should be compared to the complete graph: N*(N-1)/2.

      The lazy deletion method for the priority queue:

        We use a max-heap (priority queue) that stores tuples (value, i, j) for non-edges (i,j) (with i<j). But when we update a non-edge (i,x), we don't remove the old one. Instead, we push a new tuple (new_value, i, x). Then when we pop from the heap, we check if the tuple we popped is still valid: 
            - Check that (i,j) is still a non-edge? 
            - Check that the stored value is equal to the current value? Actually, we don't store the current value. Instead, we note that the value we stored is outdated if we have updated that non-edge.

        Alternatively, we can store a timestamp? Or we can store in an array the current value for the non-edge (i,j). 

        Actually, we can maintain an array best_value[i][j] for the current value of non-edge (i,j). But that is O(N^2) which is acceptable? 500*500=250000, which is acceptable.

        But we don't need a 2D array? We can maintain a dictionary? Or we can do:

            We maintain an array (or dictionary) current_value for each non-edge? Actually, we can index by (min(i,j), max(i,j))? 

        Alternatively, we can avoid storing the current value in an array and use the lazy method: when we pop a non-edge (i,j) and we see that it is not a non-edge anymore (because we have added it in the meantime) or we see that the value we have is not the current value? But we don't have the current value stored. 

        How about: when we update a non-edge (i,j), we set a flag that the old entry is invalid? 

        Instead, we can do:

            We maintain an array last_update_time for each non-edge? Or we can store the current value in an array: let current_val[i][j] = deg[i] + deg[j] for non-edge (i,j). Then when we push an update, we set current_val[i][j] = new_value and push (new_value, i, j). Then when we pop, we check if the popped value equals current_val[i][j]. If it does, then it is valid. If it is less, then it is outdated and we skip.

        Steps for the lazy priority queue:

            Initialize: 
                current_val: 2D array of size [N+1][N+1] (only for i<j) for non-edges? Actually, we only care about non-edges that exist. We can initialize for every non-edge (i,j) (with i<j) that is initially present: current_val[i][j] = deg[i] + deg[j].

            Then, we build a priority queue (max-heap) with all non-edges: (current_val[i][j], i, j). Note: we store negative values for min-heap? Or we use a max-heap by storing (-value) for a min-heap? Or we use a max-heap: in Python, heapq is a min-heap, so we store (-value, i, j) to simulate max-heap.

            Then, while the queue is not empty:
                Pop the top: (val, i, j) = heappop(heap) -> but note: if we stored negative for min-heap, then we have val_actual = -val.
                Check if (i,j) is still a non-edge? Actually, we have a 2D boolean array for the graph: if graph[i][j] is True, then skip.
                Check if val_actual == current_val[i][j]? If not, skip.

                Then, if val_actual < k, then we break (because the max in the heap is less than k? But note: we are popping the maximum value. If the maximum value we have is less than k, then we break). Actually, we break when the maximum value is less than k. But note: we are storing the maximum value in the heap? We have a max-heap, so the first element is the maximum. Therefore, if the maximum is < k, then we break.

                But note: the popped element is the maximum. So if the popped element (which is the current maximum) is < k, then we break.

                Otherwise, we add the edge (i,j). Then we update:
                    deg[i] += 1
                    deg[j] += 1
                    Mark graph[i][j] = True (and graph[j][i]=True)

                    Remove (i,j) from consideration: we set current_val[i][j] = None? But we don't have to.

                Then, for every non-neighbor x of i (which we get from non_neighbors[i]? But note: we are going to update the non-edges incident to i and j. However, we just updated the graph: so we remove j from non_neighbors[i] and i from non_neighbors[j]. Then for each x in non_neighbors[i] (which now does not include j), we update the non-edge (i,x): 
                    old_val = current_val[min(i,x)][max(i,x)]   # but we have to index by sorted pair
                    new_val = old_val + 1   # because deg[i] increased by 1? Actually, no: the old_val = old_deg[i] + deg[x]. Now we have deg[i] = old_deg[i]+1, so new_val = old_deg[i]+1 + deg[x] = old_val + 1.

                    But wait: what if x has been updated? Then the current_val for (i,x) might not be old_deg[i]+deg[x]? Actually, we maintain current_val for (i,x) as the last computed value. When we update, we set:

                    current_val[i][x] = new_val   # note: we assume i<x? Actually, we store the pair (min(i,x), max(i,x)). 

                    Then we push the new_val (as a negative for min-heap) into the heap.

                Similarly, for every non-neighbor x of j (that is not i and still a non-edge) we update:
                    current_val[min(j,x)][max(j,x)] += 1
                    push the new value.

                However, note: if x is adjacent to both i and j? Then we skip.

                But also note: the non-edge (i,x) might be updated twice: once because i was updated and once because x was updated? But we update only the incident edges when we update a vertex? Actually, we update the non-edges incident to i when we update i, and incident to j when we update j. 

                But in this algorithm, we update the non-edges incident to i and j only when we add an edge (i,j). Then the non-edges incident to i and j are updated. 

                However, if a non-edge (i,x) is incident to i, then we update it. Then later if we add an edge incident to x, we update (i,x) again? But that will be handled when we update the edge incident to x. 

                But here we update the non-edges incident to a vertex only when we add an edge incident to that vertex? Actually, in this update we are updating the non-edges incident to i and j because we just increased the degrees of i and j. 

                However, note: we are updating the non-edges (i,x) by increasing their value by 1. But what if x has been updated in the meantime? Then the current_val[i][x] we have stored might not be the current value? Actually, we are storing the current value in current_val[i][x]. And when we update, we do:

                    current_val[i][x] += 1   (because the degree of i increased by one)

                But wait: what if x had its degree updated in a previous step? Then the current_val[i][x] is the value that already reflects the previous updates? Actually, no: when we update the non-edge (i,x) in the past, we set current_val[i][x] to the value at that time. Then we push a new entry. Now we are updating because i's degree increased: we update current_val[i][x] by adding 1. Then we push a new entry. 

                However, we must note: the degree of x might have increased in a previous update? But that would have been handled when we updated x: we would have updated the non-edges incident to x, including (i,x). Therefore, the current_val[i][x] is always the current value? 

                Actually, no: when we update a non-edge (i,x) because of an update to x, we set current_val[i][x] to the new value. Then when we update because of i, we set current_val[i][x] = current_val[i][x] + 1? But that would be incorrect because the current_val[i][x] already reflects the current degrees. 

                How should we update? 

                    We should set: current_val[i][x] = deg[i] + deg[x]. 

                At the moment we update (i,j) and we update the degrees: 
                    deg[i] = old_deg[i] + 1
                    deg[j] = old_deg[j] + 1

                Then for each non-neighbor x of i: 
                    current_val[i][x] = deg[i] + deg[x]   [because we have the current deg[i] and deg[x]]

                Similarly for j.

                So we don't update by adding 1? We recalc: 

                    new_val = deg[i] + deg[x]

                But we don't know deg[x]? We do: we have the current degree of x.

                Therefore, we can do:

                    For each x in non_neighbors[i]:
                         old_val = current_val[i][x]   # but we don't really need it
                         current_val[i][x] = deg[i] + deg[x]   # because we have updated deg[i] and deg[x] is the current degree of x (which might have been updated by previous operations? and we assume we have the current state of deg)

                Then we push the new value.

                However, note: the degree of x might have been updated in the past, so we have the current deg[x] in the deg array.

                But then we don't need to store current_val? Because we can always compute it as deg[i] + deg[x]? However, we need current_val to check the validity of the heap entries. 

                Actually, we can avoid storing current_val and instead, when we pop an element, we compute the current value = deg[i] + deg[j] and compare to the stored value? But then if the graph has changed (edge added) we skip. 

                So we can do without the current_val array? 

                Steps for a fixed k:

                  deg: array of current degrees.
                  adj: 2D boolean array for edges.

                  non_neighbors: for each i, a set of non-neighbors (that are still non-neighbors).

                  heap: min-heap for max values? We store: (-value, i, j) for non-edge (i,j) (with i<j).

                  We initialize the heap: for every non-edge (i,j) (with i<j), push ( - (deg[i]+deg[j]), i, j).

                  Then, while heap:
                      pop: (neg_val, i, j) = heapq.heappop(heap)
                      value = -neg_val
                      If adj[i][j] is True -> skip (already added, so this entry is outdated).
                      Else, if deg[i] + deg[j] != value: 
                          This entry is outdated: we pushed a new one? Then skip.
                      Else, if value < k: 
                          Then we break because the maximum value (which is the one we popped) is less than k? But note: we are using a min-heap for negative values, so the top of the heap is the smallest negative value (which corresponds to the largest positive). But when we break? Actually, if the current value (which is the one we stored) is less than k, then we break. However, note: we popped the largest value? But we are storing negative values. The heap is a min-heap, so the smallest element (most negative) is the one with the largest absolute value. But when we pop, we get the largest value? 

                      Actually, we break when the largest value in the heap is less than k? But if the one we popped is the largest and it is < k, then we break. However, we might have skipped outdated entries and the heap might have a larger value? 

                  How to ensure we break at the right time? 

                  Alternatively, we can break when the current largest value (which we get from the heap) is less than k. But we don't know the current largest value without popping. 

                  We can do: 

                    while heap is not empty:
                        (neg_val, i, j) = heap[0]   (peek the top)
                        value = -neg_val
                        if value < k: break   # because the largest value (which is the top) is less than k? But the heap is a min-heap of negative values, so the top is the largest positive value? 

                    But wait: 
                        We store (-value, ...). The heap is a min-heap, so the top is the smallest element in the min-heap, which is the negative of the largest value? 

                    Actually, the top of the heap is the element with the smallest negative value, which is the largest positive value. Therefore, if the top of the heap is (neg_val, i, j) and -neg_val < k, then the largest value in the heap is less than k -> break.

                  But we cannot peek and then break? Then we break without popping? But then we don't process the rest. 

                  Actually, we can break when the top of the heap (without popping) has value (the positive) < k. Then we break.

                  However, we must also pop the outdated ones. So:

                    while heap is not empty:
                        (neg_val, i, j) = heap[0]
                        value = -neg_val
                        if value < k: break   # then we break because no non-edge has value>=k.

                        Then pop the top.

                        Then check: if adj[i][j] is True -> skip.
                        Else, if deg[i] + deg[j] != value: 
                            skip (and continue the while loop, popping the next)
                        Else: 
                            We add the edge (i,j): 
                                adj[i][j] = True, adj[j][i] = True
                                deg[i] += 1
                                deg[j] += 1
                                Remove j from non_neighbors[i] and i from non_neighbors[j].

                                Then, for each x in non_neighbors[i] (which is a copy of the set? because we are modifying non_neighbors for other purposes? but we are only iterating) we do:
                                    new_val = deg[i] + deg[x]
                                    push (-new_val, min(i,x), max(i,x))   [but note: we store the pair as (min, max) to avoid duplication? Actually, we store the pair (i,x) but we have to fix the order?]

                                    But note: we don't need to remove the old entries. They will be detected as outdated.

                                Similarly for j: for each x in non_neighbors[j]:
                                    new_val = deg[j] + deg[x]
                                    push (-new_val, min(j,x), max(j,x))

                  This algorithm is efficient? 

                  The total number of edges we add is at most O(N^2). Each edge addition, we update O(deg_non_neighbors(i)) and O(deg_non_neighbors(j)), which is O(N) per edge. Then the total operations is O(N^3). 

                  The heap operations: each push is O(log |heap|). The heap size is O(N^2). The total number of pushes is O(N^3) (each edge update might push O(N) new entries). Then the total heap operations are O(N^3 * log(N^2)) = O(N^3 * log N). 

                  For N=500, N^3 = 125e6, and log(N^2)= log(250000) ≈ 18, so 125e6 * 18 = 2.25e9 operations. This is too slow in Python? 

        We need a more efficient update.

        Alternatively, we can update the non-edges incident to i and j without pushing all the new values? But we have to update the heap for each non-edge incident to i and j. 

        However, we can avoid updating the entire heap by using a better data structure? 

        Known: the closure simulation for a fixed k can be done in O(N+M) time? 

        Actually, there is an efficient algorithm: 

            We maintain an array deg of the current degrees.
            We maintain a list of non-edges? 

            We also maintain a global array that for each vertex i, we have the current degree.

            Then, we can do:

                Let Q be a queue (or stack) of non-edges that we want to check? 

                We start by pushing all non-edges that have deg[i]+deg[j] >= k.

                Then, while Q is not empty:
                    pop a non-edge (i,j) from Q.
                    If the edge (i,j) has been added, skip.
                    If deg[i]+deg[j] < k, skip? But we pushed it when it was >=k, and then the degrees might have increased? Actually, no: the condition might become false if we added edges incident to i and j? Actually, no: when we add an edge incident to i and j, we update the degrees? Then the condition might become true again? 

                Actually, we can use the following:

                    We maintain for each vertex i, the current degree.

                    We also maintain an array of booleans for non-edges: added or not.

                    Then, we add an edge (i,j) when we see it and then update the degrees of i and j. Then, we must check all non-edges incident to i and j? 

                This is similar to the heap method, but we use a queue and we check only when the edge might become addable? 

            But worst-case we might push each non-edge many times. 

        Alternatively, we can use the following known efficient method (from known implementations of the closure): 

            We sort the vertices by their initial degrees? 

            Then, we try to add edges between vertices that are not connected? 

        Actually, we can use an algorithm that works in O(N^2) per fixed k? 

        We can use: 

            We maintain an array deg of the current degrees.
            We maintain a 2D boolean matrix for the graph.

            We also maintain a list of non-edges? 

            Then, we do:

                changed = True
                while changed:
                    changed = False
                    for each non-edge (i,j) that has not been added: 
                        if deg[i] + deg[j] >= k:
                            add the edge (i,j): set adj[i][j]=True, adj[j][i]=True, deg[i]++, deg[j]++, and remove the non-edge.
                            changed = True
                            break?  But if we break, then we have to restart the for loop? 

                Then, we do multiple passes until no more edges can be added.

            This is O(N^2) per edge added, so O(N^4) per fixed k. For N=500, that is 500^4 = 62.5e9, which is too slow.

Given the complexity, we must look for a better approach.

There is a known result: the k-closure is complete if and only if k is at most the minimum value such that the closure is complete? Actually, we want the maximum k. 

But there is a characterization: 

    The maximum k for which the closure is complete is the minimum value of deg[u] + deg[v] over all non-edges (u,v) in the final closure? Not exactly.

Actually, Bondy and Chvatal proved that the closure for k is the same as the closure for the threshold k. And the closure is complete if and only if there is no partition of the vertices into two nonempty sets S and T such that the sum of the degrees in the final closure (which is complete) in the set S is not sufficient? 

Alternatively, there is a known formula: 

    The maximum k for which the k-closure is complete is: 

        k = min_{S \subseteq V, S nonempty and independent?} ... 

    Actually, it is: 

        k = min_{i} { deg_{closure}(i) + something }? 

But note: in the final closure, the graph is complete, so the degree of every vertex is N-1. But that doesn't give us the threshold.

Another known result: 

    The closure for k is complete if and only if there is no subset S of vertices such that the graph induced by S is not complete and the sum of the degrees in the entire graph (not induced) for any two non-adjacent vertices in S is < k. 

Actually, the following is a necessary and condition: 

    For every pair of non-adjacent vertices (u,v) in the original graph, we require that in the closure process, eventually deg(u)+deg(v) >= k. 

    But how to compute the final degrees in the closure? 

    There is a linear time method to compute the closure for a fixed k by iteratively remove the vertex with the smallest degree and then updating? 

    Algorithm for fixed k (efficiently): 

        Let d[1..n] be the initial degrees.
        Let alive[1..n] be initially all true.
        Let graph = initial graph.

        Then, we can do:

            queue = a priority queue of vertices with degree < some value? 

            Actually, we do:

                while there exists a vertex i with alive[i] and deg[i] < ceil(k/2) ??? 

        Alternatively, we can use the following: 

            We know that in the closure, the edge (i,j) will be added if and only if the condition is satisfied at some point. 

        But there is an efficient algorithm: 

            Sort the vertices by degree.
            Then, use a pointer from the highest degree to the lowest? 

        This is complicated.

Given the time, and that N is only 500, we might do the following for the overall solution:

    We are to find the maximum k in [0, 2*(N-1)] such that the k-closure is complete.

    We know that the property is monotonic: if k0 works, then every k<=k0 works. Therefore, we can try to binary search on k.

    The number of distinct k is 2*N, so we do O(log(2*N)) = about 10 iterations.

    For each candidate k, we simulate the closure using the heap method described above, which is O(N^3 log N) per candidate k. Then 10 * (N^3 log N) = 10 * 125e6 * 18 = 22.5e9 operations, which is too slow.

    Alternatively, we can try to simulate the closure without the heap, but with a more efficient method. 

    There is an efficient method: 

        We maintain the current graph and the current degrees.
        We also maintain a global count of the number of edges added.
        We then, in each step, find the pair (i,j) of non-edge with the maximum deg[i]+deg[j]. If this maximum is < k, then break. Otherwise, add that edge.

        To find the maximum quickly, we can do:

            For each vertex i, let max_degree_sum[i] = max{ deg[i] + deg[j] for j in non_neighbors[i] }.

            Then the global maximum is max_{i} max_degree_sum[i].

        Then when we add an edge (i,j), we update the degrees of i and j, and then for each vertex x, the value max_degree_sum[x] might change if x is non-adjacent to i or j. 

        But updating max_degree_sum[x] for a vertex x might be O(1) if we keep for each x a heap of the non-edges incident to x? 

        Specifically, for each vertex i, we maintain a heap (max-heap) of the values (deg[i]+deg[j]) for j in non_neighbors[i]. Then max_degree_sum[i] = the top of the heap.

        Then the global maximum is the maximum over i of max_degree_sum[i]. We maintain a global heap for the max_degree_sum[i] for all i.

        Steps for a fixed k:

          Let's have:
            deg: array of initial degrees.
            adj: initial graph.
            non_neighbors: sets for each i.
            For each i, heap_i = a max-heap for the values (deg[i]+deg[j]) for j in non_neighbors[i] (and we store the value and j).
            global_heap = a max-heap of (max_degree_sum[i], i) for every i.

          Then, while global_heap is not empty and the top of global_heap is >=k:
              Pop the top: (value, i) = global_heap[0] and then we know that for vertex i, the best non-edge is with value = value.
              Now, from heap_i, we pop until we find a valid non-edge: 
                  While heap_i is not empty:
                      (val, j) = heap_i.top()
                      Check if (i,j) is still a non-edge and if the value is still deg[i]+deg[j]? 
                      If not, pop and continue.
                      If valid, then we have found the non-edge (i,j) to add.

              If we find no valid non-edge in heap_i, then we set max_degree_sum[i] = -inf and remove i from global_heap? 

              Otherwise, we add the edge (i,j).

              Then we update:
                  deg[i] += 1
                  deg[j] += 1
                  // remove the non-edge (i,j): 
                  Remove j from non_neighbors[i] and i from non_neighbors[j].

              Then, for vertex i: we must update the values in heap_i: 
                  For every non-edge (i,x) that remains, the value might have changed? Actually, the value for (i,x) is deg[i] (which increased by 1) + deg[x]. But deg[x] might be the same (unless x is j or other?).

                  However, we are not updating the values in heap_i for (i,x) when deg[x] changes? Only when we update deg[x] for x in {i,j} in this step, we have to update the non-edges incident to i and j? 

              Actually, we will update the heaps for all x that are affected by the degree update of i and j. Specifically:

                  For vertex i: we will need to update the heaps of its non-neighbors? Because the non-edge (x,i) for x non-adjacent to i now has an increased value because deg[i] increased. 

              How to update? 

                  When we increase deg[i] by 1, then for every non-neighbor x of i, the value for the non-edge (i,x) becomes (deg[i]+1) + deg[x] = (old_value) + 1.

                  But we can't easily update all heap_i for x. Instead, we can simply push a new entry in heap_x: new_value = deg[x] + deg[i] (current) for the non-edge (x,i). And similarly for i: in heap_i, we might not need to update the existing entries, because we will validate when we pop. 

              Alternatively, we can recompute the max_degree_sum for i and for j and for every x that is a non-neighbor of i or j. 

              Specifically:

                  For vertex i: after the update, we might have heap_i containing outdated entries. We will eventually clean them when we pop. But to get the new max_degree_sum[i], we must clean heap_i until the top is valid, and then set max_degree_sum[i] = the top value, and then push that into the global_heap.

                  Similarly for vertex j.

                  Additionally, for every non-neighbor x of i, the non-edge (x,i) has changed. So we must update heap_x: we push a new entry in heap_x with value = deg[x] + deg[i] (current).

                  Similarly for j: for every non-neighbor x of j, push a new entry in heap_x with value = deg[x] + deg[j].

              Then, after updating heap_i and heap_j (cleaning the top and setting max_degree_sum[i] and max_degree_sum[j]), and also updating the heaps for the non-neighbors x of i and j, we must update the global_heap for i, j, and for every non-neighbor x of i and j. 

          This becomes very complex.

Given the complexity of implementation and that N is only 500, we can try the following for a fixed k in the binary search:

    Use the simple O(N^2) per edge added: 

        added = a 2D boolean array, initially the initial graph is added.
        deg = initial degrees.

        Let total_non_edges = (N*(N-1)//2 - M
        Let count = 0

        changed = True
        while changed:
            changed = False
            found = False
            best_sum = -1
            best_i = -1
            best_j = -1
            For i in range(1, N+1):
                for j in range(i+1, N+1):
                    if not added[i][j] and deg[i] + deg[j] >= k:
                        if deg[i]+deg[j] > best_sum:
                            best_sum = deg[i]+deg[j]
                            best_i = i
                            best_j = j
                            found = True
            if found:
                # add the edge (best_i, best_j)
                added[best_i][best_j] = True
                added[best_j][best_i] = True
                deg[best_i] += 1
                deg[best_j] += 1
                count += 1
                changed = True

        Then, if count == total_non_edges, then candidate k works.

    This is O(N^2) per edge added, and we add O(N^2) edges, so O(N^4) per candidate k.

    For N=500, N^4 = 625e6 * 10 = 6.25e9 for 10 candidate k's. This is borderline in C++ but in Python it might be too slow.

    However, note that in practice, the number of edges added is not necessarily N^2; it might be much less if k is too high and we break early. But in the worst-case (k=0) we add all non-edges, so it is O(N^4) per candidate.

    Since we do binary search over about 10 iterations, and 10 * (500^4) = 10 * 625000000 = 6.25e9 iterations, which is too slow in Python.

Therefore, we need a more efficient method.

After research, there is a known more efficient algorithm for the closure: 

    While there is a non-edge (i,j) with deg[i] + deg[j] >= k, choose the one with the highest deg[i] + deg[j] and add it.

    To do this efficiently, we can use a (num_changes) and iterate in a sorted manner. 

    But we can try: 

        Use a vector of non-edges. Then sort them by the initial deg[i]+deg[j] in descending order. 
        Then, we try to add in that sorted order. 
        But then degrees change, so we may have to resort or reinsert.

    This is similar to the heap method above.

    Alternatively, we can use a bucket sort. 

Given the complexity and the constraints (N<=500), we might decide to use the heap method with lazy deletion for the fixed-k closure simulation, and then do a binary search over k in the range [0, 2*(N-1)].

    Number of iterations in binary search: O(log(2*N)) = O(10) iterations.
    For each candidate k, we simulate the closure using a heap with lazy deletion. The complexity is O(N^3 log N) per candidate, which for N=500 is about 125e6 * 18 = 2.25e9 per candidate, and 10 * 2.25e9 = 22.5e9, which is too slow in Python.

Therefore, we must use a more efficient method for the closure for a fixed k.

There is an O(N^2) algorithm for the closure for a fixed k: 

    Algorithm (known as the method in the proof of the closure theorem):
        Let H be the current graph.
        Repeat n times: 
            Sort the vertices by their current degree in increasing order.
            Let v be the first vertex in this sorted order.
            For each 
        Not exactly.

    Another known method: 

        While there exists a non-edge (i,j) with deg[i]+deg[j] >= k, choose the one that maximizes deg[i]+deg[j] and add it. But how to find the best one quickly? 

        We can do:

            Let's maintain the following: 
                best_pair_val = -1
                best_pair = (0,0)
                For i in range(1, N+1):
                    for j in range(i+1, N+1):
                        if not added[i][j] and deg[i]+deg[j] > best_pair_val:
                            best_pair_val = deg[i]+deg[j]
                            best_pair = (i,j)

            If best_pair_val < k: break.

            Then add the edge for best_pair.

        This is O(N^2) per edge, and O(N^4) per fixed k.

    But we can optimize the search for the best pair: 

        We maintain a matrix of the current deg[i]+deg[j] for non-edges. 
        When we add an edge (i,j), then for every x, the value for (i,x) and (j,x) will change. 
        So after adding (i,j), we can update the values for all non-edges incident to i and j in O(N) time.

        Also, we can maintain a global variable best_pair_val and best_pair, and update it after each edge addition by checking the affected non-edges (i,x) and (j,x) and also the non-edges that were out of date.

        Specifically:

            best_pair_val = -1
            best_pair = None

            // initial: for all non-edges (i,j), compute val = deg[i]+deg[j], and if val > best_pair_val, update.

            Then, after adding (i,j):
                // update the degrees of i and j.
                deg[i] += 1
                deg[j] += 1

                // for non-edges incident to i: for each x such that the edge (i,x) is not present, update val for (i,x) = deg[i] + deg[x]
                // similarly for j.

                // also, the edge (i,j) is now added, so remove it.

                // then, for x in range(1, N+1): if x not in [i,j] and not added[i][x]:
                    new_val = deg[i] + deg[x]
                    // this non-edge (i,x) might now be the new best_pair_val if new_val > best_pair_val.

                // similarly for (j,x).

                // also, we might have to consider non-edges not incident to i or j, but the best_pair_val might be from them. However, we maintain best_pair_val as the maximum over all non-edges.

            But then we can do:

                best_pair_val = -1
                best_pair = None
                // and then scan all non-edges? -> O(N^2) per edge, then O(N^4) per fixed k.

            Alternatively, we can try to update only the affected non-edges and compare to the current best_pair_val.

                affected_val = -1
                affected_pair = None

                // for non-edges incident to i: 
                for x in range(1, N+1):
                    if x == i or x==j: continue
                    if not added[i][x]:
                        val = deg[i] + deg[x]
                        if val > affected_val:
                            affected_val = val
                            affected_pair = (min(i,x), max(i,x))
                    if not added[j][x]:
                        val = deg[j] + deg[x]
                        if val > affected_val:
                            affected_val = val
                            affected_pair = (min(j,x), max(j,x))

                // then, the new best_pair_val = max( best_pair_val (from before the update), affected_val )

                However, best_pair_val from before the update might be from a non-edge that is now added or that is incident to i or j and has been updated? 

                Specifically, the best_pair_val from before the update might be for a non-edge that is not incident to i or j, then it is unchanged. Or it might be for a non-edge that is incident to i or j, then it is updated in the affected_val.

                Actually, before the update, we had a best_pair_val and best_pair. After we added (i,j), we removed the non-edge (i,j) (which might have been the best_pair). Then we have to consider:

                    Option1: the best_pair_val might be from a non-edge not incident to i or j -> then it is still valid and unchanged.
                    Option2: the best_pair_val might be from a non-edge incident to i or j -> then it might have changed.

                To be safe, we can do:

                    new_best_pair_val = best_pair_val_from_before  // but only if the non-edge best_pair is still not added and is not incident to i or j? 

                This is messy.

            Instead, after updating the affected non-edges (incident to i or j), we can do:

                new_best_pair_val = max( best_pair_val_from_before, affected_val )

                But only if the best_pair_val_from_before is from a non-edge that is still valid. How to check? We can store the best_pair from before, and if that best_pair is still a non-edge and is not incident to i or j, then it is unchanged. If it is incident to i or j, then we have recalculated its value in affected_val? 

                Actually, we store the best_pair (i0, j0) from before. If (i0, j0) is not the edge (i,j) we just added, and if it is not incident to i or j, then its value is unchanged. If it is incident to i or j, then we have not recalculated its value in affected_val because we iterated only on x. 

                For example, if best_pair was (i0, i) for i0 not i and not j, then in the affected_val for i, we would have consider x=i0, so we have a new value for (i, i0). But we did: 
                    for x in [1, N] (excluding i and j), we considered (i, x) and (j,x). So if best_pair was (i, i0), then we did consider it.

                Therefore, after updating, we have in affected_val the maximum over non-edges incident to i or j (for the new values). 

                Then, new_best_pair_val = max( best_pair_val_from_before ( if the best_pair from before is not incident to i or j and not added) , affected_val )

                But if the best_pair from before was not incident to i or j and is still not added, then its value is unchanged and might be >= any affected_val.

                So we can do:

                    new_best_pair_val = best_pair_val_from_before
                    new_best_pair = best_pair_from before

                    if best_pair_from before is the edge we just added OR if best_pair_from before is incident to i or j then we have to reset best_pair_from before because its value might have changed or it might be added. 

                Alternatively, we can simply: 
                    new_best_pair_val = -1
                    new_best_pair = None
                    and then set new_best_pair_val = max( new_best_pair_val, best_pair_val_from_before ) only if the best_pair_from before is still a non-edge and is not incident to i or j -> then unchanged.

                This is messy.

 Given the complexity, and since N is 500, we might as well do a full scan after each edge addition. The total number of edge additions is at most (N*(N-1)//2 - M, which is O(N^2). Each full scan is O(N^2). So total O(N^4) per fixed k.

 For N=500, N^4 = 625e6 per fixed k. For 10 iterations of binary search, 6.25e9, which in C++ might be borderline in 1 second (especially with optimizations), in Python it will be slow.

 But note: the sample inputs are small. And we may break early if best_pair_val < k. 

 However, the worst-case (k=0) we do add all non-edges, and then we do O(N^4) work.

 Since N is only 500, and 500^4 = 625000000, which is 625 million, and for 10 iterations, 6.25 billion, which in C++ might be a few seconds, but in Python it will be minutes.

Therefore, we must use the heap with lazy deletion for the fixed-k simulation.

We in Python can try to optimize by using a heap for the entire non-edges with lazy deletion. 

    For a fixed k, 
        Let's maintain:
            heap = []  # min-heap for (-value, i, j)
            current = a 2D array (or a 1D array of sets) for the graph, but we can use a boolean matrix.
            deg = [0]*(N+1)

        Initialization: 
            for i in range(1, N+1):
                for j in range(i+1, N+1):
                    if not initial_graph[i][j]:
                        val = deg[i] + deg[j]   # using the initial deg
                        heapq.heappush(heap, (-val, i, j))

            # also, we might need to know the current value for each non-edge? but we can recompute when we pop.
            # and we have the current deg and graph.

        Then, while heap:
            # find the edge with the largest value (>=k) that is valid.
            while heap:
                neg_val, i, j = heapq.heappop(heap)
                val = -neg_val
                if val < k: 
                    # then even the largest is <k, break.
                    heap = []  # break and then break the while
                    break
                if graph[i][j]:
                    continue   # already added
                if deg[i] + deg[j] != val:
                    # this is an outdated entry, skip.
                    continue
                # otherwise, add the edge (i,j)
                graph[i][j] = True
                graph[j][i] = True
                deg[i] += 1
                deg[j] += 1
                # For each x that is a non-neighbor of i: all x such that !graph[i][x] (x != j)
                for x in range(1, N+1):
                    if x == i or x == j: continue
                    if not graph[i][x]:
                        new_val_i = deg[i] + deg[x]
                        heapq.heappush(heap, (-new_val_i, i, x))
                    if not graph[j][x]:
                        new_val_j = deg[j] + deg[x]
                        heapq.heappush(heap, (-new_val_j, j, x))
                break  # we added one edge, break the while heap? and continue to next edge.
            else:
                break

        Then, in the end, count the number of edges in the graph: if it is N*(N-1)//2, then it is complete.

        Note: the while heap loop might not empty the heap, but we are using a break after adding one edge.

        This is one edge addition per outer while loop iteration.

        The total number of edge additions is at most (N*(N-1)//2 - M.

        For each edge addition, we push O(N) new heap entries. So the total number of heap pushes is O(N^3).

        The total number of heap pops: might be large because of outdated entries. In the worst-case, the heap size becomes O(N^3), and each pop is O(log(N^3)) = O(log N).

        Total operations: O(N^3 * log(N^3)) = O(N^3 * log N), which for N=500, 125e6 * log(125000) which is about 125e6 * 17 = 2.125e9.

        For 10 iterations of binary search: 21.25e9, which in Python might be minutes.

Given the time constraints, and since we are in Python, we must hope that the constant is small or use a better method.

There is a better method: use a single priority queue and rely on the fact that the closure is independent of the order, so we may not need to break after one edge. We can in fact use the following: 

    while the heap is not empty and the top of the heap has value>=k:
        pop until we get a valid edge to add, then add it and update the degrees and push new values for the non-edges incident to the two vertices.

    This is the same as above.

    But to avoid the heap getting too big, we note that there are only O(N^2) non-edges. Initially, the heap has O(N^2) entries. Then, we push O(N) per edge added, so total heap size is O(N^2 + N * (number of edge added)) = O(N^2 + N^3) = O(N^3). This is acceptable in memory (25000000 entries? in Python, each entry is a tuple of three integers, about 3 * 4 bytes = 12 bytes, then 25e6 * 12 = 300 MB, which is acceptable within 256 MB? not quite, because we have 10 iterations? but we do 10 iterations sequentially, so we can reuse. So memory is not the issue.)

    Time: O(N^3 log N) per fixed k, which is 2.125e9 per fixed k, and 10 iterations would be 21.25e9, which in C++ is a few minutes, in Python it might be 1000 seconds.

Therefore, for Python, we need a more efficient method.

After reading a known solution in C++ for the same problem (which is common in informatics), we see that the solution is to use a binary search on k and for each k, to simulate the closure using a while loop that at each step does:

    Let u = the vertex with the smallest current degree.
    Let v = the vertex with the largest current degree among the non-neighbors of u.
    If deg[u] + deg[v] < k, then remove u and never consider it again (because any edge incident to u will not be addable? ) -> not exactly.

    Algorithm for fixed k (efficient) by [Havel-Hakimi like] from [[

        while there is at least one non-edge:

            sort the vertices by degree.
            find a vertex u with the smallest degree.
            If there is no non-edge incident to u, remove u and continue? not exactly.

            Among the non-neighbors of u, find the one with the largest degree, call it v.
            If deg[u] + deg[v] < k, then we cannot add any edge incident to u, so we remove u and continue.
            else, add the edge (u, v), update deg[u] and deg[v] (increase by 1), and continue.

        If in the end we have added all non-edges, then k is valid.

    But is this correct? 

        The idea is: vertex u has the smallest degree. If even the non-edge (u,v) where v is the non-neighbor of u with the largest degree has deg[u]+deg[v] < k, then certainly any other non-edge (u,x) has deg[u]+deg[x] <= deg[u]+deg[v] < k, so we cannot add any edge incident to u. Therefore, u is hopeless and we remove it.

        Then, we 
            remove u from the graph (alive[u] = false)
            and then continue to the next iteration.

        Note: when we remove u, we also remove all edges incident to u, but in our process we are only adding edges. Actually, we are not physically removing the edges, but we will not consider u for future edge additions.

        After removing u, the graph has one less vertex. Then we repeat.

        If we are able to remove all vertices without any removal due to the condition (i.e., we added all edges incident to the smallest degree vertex), then we have added all non-edges.

        But if at some point we have to remove a vertex that still has non-edges incident to it, then we will not be able to add those non-edges.

    This algorithm is O(N^2) per fixed k, because in each step we remove one vertex, and there are O(N) steps, and each step we sort the vertices (O(N log N)) and find the non-neighbor of u with the largest degree by scanning the non-neighbors of u (O(N)).

    Total for fixed k: O(N^2 * N) = O(N^3)? 
        O(N) steps, each step O(N) to find the non-neighbor of u with the largest degree, and also sorting in O(N log N) -> then O(N^2 log N) per fixed k.

    For N=500, 500^2 * log(500) = 250000 * 9 = 2.25e6 per fixed k, and 10 iterations -> 22.5e6, which is acceptable in Python.

    Let's test with the sample: 
        Sample #1: N=4, M=3, edges: (1,2),(2,3),(3,4)
        degrees: [1,2,2,1] for vertices 1,2,3,4.

        Let k=3.
        Step1: 
            sort by degree: vertices: 1:1, 4:1, 2:2, 3:2. 
            u = vertex1 (smallest degree).
            non-neighbors of 1: [3,4] (since 1 is connected to 2 initially).
            Among non-neighbors, the one with the largest degree: both 3 and 4 have degree 2 and 1? 
               at this point: 
                  vertex1: degree1=1, 
                  vertex4: degree4=1, 
                  vertex2:2, vertex3:2.
                non-neighbors of 1: [3,4] -> the largest degree: 
                   3 has degree2, 4 has degree1 -> so v=3.
                deg[1]+deg[3]=1+2=3>=3 -> add edge (1,3)
                update: deg[1]=2, deg[3]=3.
                The graph now has edges: (1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(1,3)

        Step2: 
            vertices: 
               1:2, 2:2, 3:3, 4:1 -> remove vertex4 (smallest degree) if we consider only alive vertices? 
               But wait, do we remove only when we cannot add an edge incident to the smallest? 
            Now, we are to remove the smallest: u=4.
            non-neighbors of 4: [1,2] (because 4 is connected to 3, and now we have added (1,3) but not (1,4) or (2,4)).
            non-edges incident to 4: (4,1) and (4,2) -> 
                for (4,1): deg[4]+deg[1]=1+2=3>=3 -> so we should be able to add one of them.
            But the algorithm: for u=4, non-neighbors: [1,2] -> the largest degree: both 1 and 2 have degree 2? any. choose the one with largest degree, say 1 or 2, doesn't matter.
            deg[4]+deg[1]=3>=3 -> add (4,1) 
            update: deg[4]=2, deg[1]=3.

        Step3: 
            vertices: 4:2, 2:2, 1:3, 3:3 -> the smallest is vertex4 or vertex2 (degree2). 
            Let u=2.
            non-neighbors of 2: [4] (because 2 is connected to 1 and 3, and not to 4).
            v=4, deg[2]+deg[4]=2+2=4>=3 -> add (2,4)

        Then we have added all edges.

        But sample also showed that with a bad order it might not work. This algorithm uses a specific order: 
            In each step, for the smallest degree vertex u, we add an edge between u and the non-neighbor with the largest degree.

        And it worked for sample.

    Therefore, we can use this algorithm for fixed-k closure simulation.

    Steps for a fixed k:

        Let alive = [True]*(N+1)  # 1-indexed, indices 1..N
        Let deg = initial degrees.
        Let adj = initially the given graph (as a 2D list or list of sets)

        Let to_remove = a queue? or we do:

        for iteration in range(1, N):   # we will remove at least one vertex per iteration, until we have one vertex left.
            # among alive vertices, find the one with smallest degree. If there are ties, any.
            min_degree = a big number
            u = -1
            for i in range(1, N+1):
                if alive[i] and deg[i] < min_degree:
                    min_degree = deg[i]
                    u = i
            if u==-1: break  # no more alive vertices

            # among the alive vertices and non-adjacent to u, find the one with the largest degree.
            max_degree = -1
            v = -1
            for i in range(1, N+1):
                if i==u: continue
                if alive[i] and (not adj[u][i]):   # non-adjacent
                    if deg[i] > max_degree:
                        max_degree = deg[i]
                        v = i
            if v == -1: 
                # then u has no non-edge? then we can remove u.
                alive[u] = False
                continue

            if deg[u] + deg[v] < k:
                # then we cannot add any edge incident to u: remove u.
                alive[u] = False
                continue
            else:
                # add the edge (u,v)
                adj[u][v] = True
                adj[v][u] = True
                deg[u] += 1
                deg[v] += 1
                # and do not remove u immediately: we might add more edges incident to u in future iterations? 
                # But note: we are in the iteration for the smallest degree vertex. We only consider one edge per iteration.
                # We then move to the next iteration.

        Then, after the loop, we need to check if the graph is complete? 
            But the algorithm does not necessarily add all edges. It only adds edges between the smallest degree vertex and the largest degree non-neighbor.
            And we remove a vertex only when it has no non-edge or when we cannot add any edge incident to it.

        How to check completeness? 
            We can count the number of edges in the graph and see if it is N*(N-1)/2.

        Alternatively, note that if we never remove a vertex prematurely (i.e., we always add an edge), then we will have added exactly (N-1) + (N-2) + ... = at least something. 

        But easier: after the simulation, we can iterate over all pairs and see if the graph is complete.

        However, the problem: in the algorithm, we might not add all edges. For example, if the graph is not complete at the end, then candidate k does not work.

    But does this algorithm in this for loop add enough edges to make the closure complete? 

        The algorithm is from known solutions to this problem (search for the problem "Educational Codeforces Round 49 (Rated for Div. 2) D - Mouse Hunt" or "Chvatal closure") -> actually, there is a known solution for the present problem in Codeforces gyms or elsewhere.

        Reference: 
          https://codeforces.com/edu/course/2/lesson/7/2/practice/contest/289391/problem/D
          is not the same.

        But we can rely on the following: 
          The algorithm is: 
            while there is an alive vertex:
              u = alive vertex with min degree.
              v = alive vertex, non-adjacent to u, with max degree.
              if not exists v: remove u.
              else if deg[u]+deg[v] < k: remove u.
              else: add the edge (u,v) and update degrees.

          This is the algorithm in known solutions for the problem of computing the closure.

        Therefore, we use it.

    Complexity: O(N) iterations, and each iteration scans O(N) for u and then O(N) for v, so O(N^2) per fixed k.

    For N=500, O(500^2)=250000 per fixed k, and 10 iterations -> 2.5e6, which is acceptable in Python.

    Let's also test on the sample input #3: 
        "5 0"
        We want to find the maximum k such that the closure is complete.

        The initial graph has 5 vertices and 0 edges. 
        The degrees are [0,0,0,0,0].

        What is the closure for a given k?
          In the first iteration: 
            u = any vertex, say vertex1 (degree0).
            non-neighbors: all other vertices, and they have degree0.
            the non-neighbor with the largest degree: any, say vertex2.
            then we require: 0+0>=k. 
            So if k<=0, then we add the edge (1,2), and then deg[1]=1, deg[2]=1.
          next iteration:
            the smallest degree: 0 (vertex3,4,5)
            say u=3.
            non-neighbors: 4,5, and also 1 and 2? (because we haven't added (3,1) and (3,2)?)
            the largest degree among non-neighbors: vertex1 and vertex2 have degree1, so we choose one, say vertex1.
            then we add (3,1) if 0+1>=k.
            So if k<=1, then we add.
            then deg[3]=1, deg[1]=2.
          next iteration:
            smallest degree: 0 (vertex4,5)
            u=4, non-neighbors: include vertex1 (degree2), vertex2 (degree1), vertex3 (degree1), vertex5 (degree0)
            choose vertex1 (degree2), then add (4,1) if 0+2>=k -> if k<=2.
          next iteration:
            u=5, non-neighbors: vertex1 (degree3), then add (5,1) if 0+3>=k -> if k<=3.
          then we have to connect the remaining non-edges: 
            (2,3): not added, and deg[2]=1, deg[3]=1 -> then in the next iteration:
                smallest: vertex2 and vertex3 and vertex4 and vertex5: 
                vertex2: degree1, non-neighbors: vertex3,4,5? 
                    but vertex2 is not connected to 3,4,5.
                the non-neighbor with largest degree: 
                    vertex1: is it non-neighbor? no, because (2,1) is added? 
                    vertex3: degree1, vertex4: degree1, vertex5: degree1.
                then we can add (2,3) if 1+1>=k -> if k<=2.
                then update: deg[2]=2, deg[3]=2.
            then for (2,4): 
                u=2 is not the smallest? the smallest might be vertex4 or vertex5 with degree1.
                then u=4: non-neighbors: vertex2, vertex3, vertex5? 
                   largest degree: vertex2 and vertex3 have degree2, vertex5 has degree1.
                add (4,2) if 1+2>=k -> if k<=3.
            then (2,5): 
                u=2: now has degree2, which is not the smallest? smallest is vertex5: degree1.
                u=5: non-neighbors: vertex2, vertex3, vertex4 -> largest degree: vertex2,3,4 have degree2 (vertex4 is now degree2? because we added (4,1) and (4,2)) 
                add (5,2) if 1+2>=k -> if k<=3.
            similarly for (3,4), (3,5), (4,5) will be added for k<=3,4,4.

        But the sample output is 0 for the graph with 0 edges? 

        Actually, the sample input #2 is "5 0", and the sample output is 0.

        Why is that? 
            The company Go must be able to add all non-edges. 
            In the work order go(G,0), it will add every non-edge because 0<=any degree sum (>=0). 
            So the only requirement is that we must be able to add all non-edges. 
            But in our closure simulation for any k<=0, we will be able to add them. 
            However, the problem asks for the highest k.

        In the all-zero initial degrees, what is the highest k such that the closure is complete? 
            In the first edge we add: requires that the degree sum (0+0)>=k, so the highest k is 0.

        Therefore, for the sample "5 0", the answer is 0.

        In our simulation for a fixed k=0, we will be able to add all edges.

        For k=1, can we add all edges? 
            In the first step: we can add (1,2) because 0+0>=1? no, 0>=1 is false.
            So we remove vertex1 (because we cannot add any edge incident to it: because the condition fails for the best candidate, and for any other candidate it would be 0+0<1). 
            Then the graph has vertices 2,3,4,5. 
            Then we try to remove vertex2: similarly, we cannot add any edge incident to it? 
            Eventually, we remove all vertices and the graph remains with no edge added.

            Therefore, the closure for k=1 is not complete.

        So the maximum k is 0.

        Therefore, the algorithm for fixed k will for k=0 return complete, for k=1 return not complete.

    Implementation for fixed k (is_complete(k)):

        deg = [0]*(N+1)
        # build an adj matrix: 
        adj = [[False]*(N+1) for _ in range(N+1)]
        # initially, add the given edges: 
        for each given edge (a,b):
            adj[a][b] = True
            adj[b][a] = True
            deg[a] += 1
            deg[b] += 1

        alive = [True]*(N+1)
        # We will use a list of the current degrees for alive vertices.

        # We will simulate until we have removed vertices (set alive to False) and no more changes? 
        # But the algorithm: 
        while there is at least one alive vertex with an available non-edge (or until we have added enough to make it complete) is not explicit.

        Instead, we do: 
            while True:
                u = -1
                min_deg = a big number (say 10**9)
                for i in range(1, N+1):
                    if not alive[i]: continue
                    if deg[i] < min_deg:
                        min_deg = deg[i]
                        u = i
                if u == -1: 
                    break   # no alive vertex, break

                # find a non-neighbor v of u that is alive and has the maximum degree
                v = -1
                max_deg = -1
                for i in range(1, N+1):
                    if i==u or not alive[i]: continue
                    if adj[u][i]: 
                        continue   # skip if already adjacent
                    if deg[i] > max_deg:
                        max_deg = deg[i]
                        v = i

                if v == -1:
                    # u has no non-edge? then remove u.
                    alive[u] = False
                    continue

                if deg[u] + deg[v] < k:
                    # cannot add any edge incident to u, remove u.
                    alive[u] = False
                    continue

                # else, add the edge (u,v)
                adj[u][v] = True
                adj[v][u] = True
                deg[u] += 1
                deg[v] += 1

        Then, after the simulation, we count the number of edges in the adj matrix: 
            total_edges = 0
            for i in range(1, N+1):
                for j in range(i+1, N+1):
                    if adj[i][j]:
                        total_edges += 1
            if total_edges == N*(N-1)//2:
                return True
            else:
                return False

        However, we can also break early if we've added enough edges? 
            But easier: after the simulation, we might have removed some vertices (set alive to False) and then the graph is not complete? 

        Actually, the simulation does not remove an edge, and we are only adding edges. The only issue is that if we remove a vertex, then the edges incident to that vertex are still there, but that vertex is not used in future non-edge checks. However, we will still count the edges incident to removed vertices.

        But note: the completeness is over the entire graph. If a vertex is removed (set alive to False), does that mean we are not requiring the edges incident to it? 
            No, the graph must be complete on the N vertices. 
        Therefore, if at the end any vertex is not alive, it means we gave up on adding some edge incident to it. Then the graph is not complete.

        So we can simply: 
            if there is any vertex that is still alive, then we have not necessarily added all edges between alive vertices. 
            But the algorithm removes a vertex only when it has no non-edge (which means it is complete for that vertex) or when we cannot add any edge incident to it (then it is not complete).

        Therefore, we can: 
            for i in range(1, N+1):
                if alive[i] is not False, then it should have been involved in the adding process until it is complete? 
            Actually, when we remove a vertex u (set alive[u]=False), we have ensured that there is no non-edge incident to u (either because we added them all or because we gave up and there are non-edges we did not add). 

        So at the end, the graph might not be complete. We can check by: 
            for i in range(1, N+1):
                for j in range(i+1, N+1):
                    if not adj[i][j]:
                        return False
            return True

        Or we can count the edges.

    Then, the overall solution:

        low = 0
        high = 2*(N-1)
        ans = 0
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low+high)//2
            if is_complete(mid):
                ans = mid
                low = mid+1
            else:
                high = mid-1

        Then output ans.

    But note: the problem asks for the highest k such that there exists an ordering that yields a complete network. And we have: if is_complete(mid) is true, then we try a higher k.

    However, is the property monotonic? 
        If the closure is complete for mid, then it is complete for every k <= mid. 
        But we want the highest k. So we are binary searching for the highest k such that is_complete(k) is True.

    This matches.

    Let's test with sample #1: 
        N=4, M=3, edges: (1,2),(2,3),(3,4)
        degrees: [1,2,2,1]

        We want to find the highest k: we know from the sample that k=3 works, and k=4 does not.

        Check for k=3: 
          while there is an alive vertex (all are alive initially)
            u = vertex1 or vertex4 (degree1). Let's take u=1.
            non-neighbors of 1: [3,4] -> the one with the largest degree: 3 (degree2) 
            deg[1]+deg[3]=1+2=3>=3 -> add edge (1,3)
            update: deg[1]=2, deg[3]=3
            then next iteration:
                alive: all true.
                min_degree: 
                    vertex1:2, vertex2:2, vertex3:3, vertex4:1 -> u=4.
                non-neighbors of 4: [1,2] (because 4 is connected to 3) -> the largest degree among vertices1 and2: both have degree2. Choose vertex1.
                deg[4]+deg[1]=1+2=3>=3 -> add (4,1) -> then deg[4]=2, deg[1]=3.
            next iteration:
                min_degree: vertex2 (degree2), vertex4:2, vertex1:3, vertex3:3 -> u=2.
                non-neighbors of 2: [4] (because 2 is connected to1 and3) -> v=4, deg[2]+deg[4]=2+2=4>=3 -> add (2,4)
            then we have a complete graph? 
                edges: (1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(1,3),(1,4),(2,4) -> complete.

            Therefore, k=3 works.

        Check for k=4:
            u=1 (degree1), non-neighbors: [3,4] -> the largest degree is 3 (degree2), 1+2=3<4 -> so we cannot add. Then we remove vertex1.
            then the graph: 
                alive: vertex1: dead, vertex2,3,4: alive.
                degrees: vertex2:2, vertex3:2, vertex4:1.
            next: u=4 (degree1), non-neighbors: vertex2 (because vertex4 is connected to3, and not to2) -> 
                deg[4]+deg[2]=1+2=3<4 -> remove vertex4.
            then: vertex2 and 3: alive. 
            next: u=2, non-neighbors: in the alive vertices, vertex3 is adjacent (because we have (2,3)), so no non-edge. remove vertex2.
            then vertex3: remove.
            Then the graph is not complete: missing (1,4), (2,4), (1,3) is added but (1,2) exists? 
            But the graph at the end has the initial edges and the edges we added: we added no edge in this simulation for k=4.
            Therefore, the graph is not complete.

            So k=4 fails.

        Therefore, the answer is 3.

    Sample #3: "5 0" -> answer=0.

    Sample #3 in the problem: 
        Input: "5 2
        1 2
        3 4"

        We are to output 2.

        Let's simulate for k=2:
          Initially, edges: (1,2) and (3,4). 
          degrees: 
            vertex1:1, vertex2:1, vertex3:1, vertex4:1, vertex5:0.

          Iteration1: 
              u = vertex5 (degree0).
              non-neighbors: all other: [1,2,3,4] -> the one with the largest degree: any of 1,2,3,4 (degree1). 
              deg[5]+deg[1]=0+1=1, which is <2? no, if we choose vertex1, then 0+1=1<2 -> then we try the next largest? they are all the same.
              So we cannot add any edge incident to vertex5? then we remove vertex5.
          Iteration2: 
              now the smallest: any of 1,2,3,4: say u=1 (degree1).
              non-neighbors: vertex3,4 (because 1 is not connected to 3,4) and vertex5 is removed. 
              the largest degree in {3,4} is 1 (both) -> choose vertex3.
              deg[1]+deg[3]=1+1=2>=2 -> add edge (1,3).
              update: deg[1]=2, deg[3]=2.
          Iteration3:
              alive: 1,2,3,4 (5 removed)
              degrees: 1:2, 2:1, 3:2, 4:1.
              smallest: vertex2 and vertex4: say u=2.
              non-neighbors: vertex3 and vertex4? 
                2 is not connected to 3? -> check: we have not added (2,3) yet. Also not to 4.
                the largest degree: vertex3 has degree2, vertex4 has degree1 -> choose vertex3.
                deg[2]+deg[3]=1+2=3>=2 -> add (2,3)
                update: deg[2]=2, deg[3]=3.
          Iteration4:
              smallest: vertex4: degree1.
              non-neighbors: vertex1,2? 
                vertex4 is not connected to vertex1? -> not initially, and we have added: 
                    initially: (1,2) and (3,4) -> then we added (1,3) and (2,3). 
                    So the only non-neighbor of vertex4 is vertex1 and vertex2? 
                the largest degree: vertex1:2, vertex2:2 -> choose vertex1.
                deg[4]+deg[1]=1+2=3>=2 -> add (4,1)
                update: deg[4]=2, deg[1]=3.
          Iteration5:
              smallest: vertex2 and vertex4: both degree2.
              take u=2.
              non-neighbors: vertex4? (because 2 is not connected to4? we have not added (2,4)) 
                deg[2]+deg[4]=2+2=4>=2 -> add (2,4)
                then deg[2]=3, deg[4]=3.
          Then, the graph: 
             We have added: (1,2) [initial], (3,4) [initial], (1,3), (2,3), (4,1), (2,4) -> is that complete on vertices 1,2,3,4? 
                1: connected to 2,3,4? -> (1,2),(1,3),(1,4) [we added (1,4) as (4,1)] -> yes.
                2: 1,3,4 -> yes.
                3: 1,2,4? -> (3,1),(3,2),(3,4) -> yes.
                4: 1,2,3 -> yes.
            But we removed vertex5, so we never added edges incident to 5. 
            Therefore, the graph is not complete (because we are missing all edges incident to 5: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4)).

          This is a problem.

        What went wrong? 
            The algorithm: we removed vertex5 in the first step, meaning we will not add any edge incident to 5. 
            Therefore, the graph will never be complete.

        But the sample output is 2.

        What should happen for k=2? 
            In the closure for k=2, should we be able to add the edges incident to 5? 
            For example, at the beginning, we cannot add (5,1) because 0+1=1<2. 
            But after we add (1,3), then the degree of 1 becomes 2, then (5,1) becomes 0+2=2, which is >=2, so we can add it.

        In our simulation, however, we removed vertex5 in the first step. 
            The algorithm: when we remove a vertex, we will not consider it in the future. 
            Therefore, we miss the opportunity to add edges incident to 5 later.

        We should not remove vertex5 permanently? 

        Known solution: the algorithm does not remove a vertex permanently; instead, it only removes a vertex for the current iteration? 

        Actually, we should not remove the vertex permanently. The algorithm should consider all vertices in every iteration. 

        The mistake: in the algorithm, we set alive[u]=False and then we never consider it again. But we should only skip it in the current iteration? 

        Let me read the algorithm: 
            It says: if we cannot add any edge incident to u, then we remove u and then in the next iterations we will not consider u.

        But then the edges incident to u will never be added. 

        In the sample: we remove vertex5, and then we never add any edge incident to 5. 

        But the sample input has 5 vertices. The complete graph on 5 vertices requires edges incident to 5.

        Therefore, the algorithm should not remove a vertex permanently. 

        Correction: the algorithm should only remove the vertex for the purpose of the current iteration? and then in the next iteration, we consider all vertices again.

        But then how do we avoid infinite loops? 

        Alternatively, we should not remove the vertex at all. Instead, if for the current smallest degree vertex u, there is a non-edge (u,v) that we can add (>=k), then we add it. 
        If there is no non-edge we can add at this moment, then we do not remove u and wait until later when the degrees have increased. 

        But then how do we make progress? 

        We can try to use a priority queue of the vertices by degree, and only in the current snapshot. But then the degrees change.

        The known efficient algorithm in the previous context might be for a different purpose.

        Let me find a known solution for the problem (in C++) for the same problem "Chvatal closure" or "graph closure" maximum k.

        After a search, we found: 
          This problem is known as: "And the next one... and the next one... and the next one..." in CodeForces gym or from an old competition.

        A known solution in C++ for the same problem (with constraints N<=500) is to use the following for fixed k:

            int n = number of vertices;
            vector<vector<int>> g(n, vector<int>(n));
            vector<int> deg(n,0);
            // read the initial graph, and initialize g and deg.

            // Then:
            vector<int> to(n, -1);
            for (int iter = 0; iter < n*(n-1)/2 - M; iter++) {
                int a = -1, b = -1;
                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                    for (int j = i+1; j < n; j++) {
                        if (!g[i][j] && (a == -1 || deg[i]+deg[j] > deg[a]+deg[b])) {
                            a = i;
                            b = j;
                        }
                    }
                }
                if (a == -1 || deg[a]+deg[b] < k) return false;
                g[a][b] = g[b][a] = 1;
                deg[a]++;
                deg[b]++;
            }
            return true;

        This is the full scan for the best non-edge in the current graph, and add it. This is O(N^2) per edge, and O(N^4) per fixed k.

        Given that we only have 10 iterations of binary search, and N=500, then 10 * ( (O(N^2) * (O(N^2)) ) = 10 * (O(N^4)) = 10 * 625e6 = 6.25e9, which in C++ is acceptable in 10 seconds, in Python not.

        Therefore, we must use the first heap method and hope that the number of outdated entries is not too high.

        Given the time, we choose the heap with lazy deletion for the fixed-k simulation, and hope that the constant is small or that the in practice the number of edge additions is not the worst-case.

        Steps for fixed-k using a heap:

            # We will use a max-heap (using negative values in a min-heap) for ( -(deg[i]+deg[j]), i, j ) for every non-edge (i,j).

            heap = []
            for i in range(N):
                for j in range(i+1, N):
                    if not initial_graph[i][j]:
                        val = deg[i] + deg[j]
                        heapq.heappush(heap, (-val, i, j))

            added_edges = 0
            target = n*(n-1)//2 - M

            while added_edges < target and heap:
                # get the candidate with the largest degree sum
                while heap:
                    neg_val, i, j = heapq.heappop(heap)
                    val = -neg_val
                    if val < k: 
                        # then we break completely
                        heap = None
                        break
                    if graph[i][j]: 
                        continue   # already added
                    if deg[i] + deg[j] != val:
                        continue   # outdated
                    # add the edge (i,j)
                    graph[i][j] = graph[j][i] = True
                    deg[i] += 1
                    deg[j] += 1
                    added_edges += 1
                    # and for 

                    # For each non-edge incident to i or j, we will be updated naturally by pushing new entries.
                    for x in range(n):
                        if x == i or x == j: continue
                        if not graph[i][x]:
                            new_val = deg[i] + deg[x]
                            heapq.heappush(heap, (-new_val, i, x))
                        if not graph[j][x]:
                            new_val = deg[j] + deg[x]
                            heapq.heappush(heap, (-new_val, j, x))
                    break   # from the inner while, we break to the outer while to added_edges.
                else:
                    break  if heap becomes empty or the largest <k, then break.

            return added_edges == target

        Then we do a binary search on k in [0, 2*(n-1)].

        We must be careful to initialize for each fixed k: 
            We need to start from the initial graph.

        We will do: 
            for each candidate k, we reset:
                graph = initial graph (as a 2D list)
                deg = initial deg (we might have to compute from the initial graph)

        Since we are doing 10 iterations, and the initial graph is small, we can deep copy.

        Let's hope that the number of edge additions is not the worst-case and that the number of outdated entries is not too high.

        Sample #3: 5 0, for k=0, we will push all non-edges (10 for n=5) initially. 
            Then we pop one: say the largest might be 0+0=0, then we add it.
            Then we update degrees and push new non-edges: for the two vertices, we push for each of them and the other three: 
                for the new edge (0,1): 
                    for vertex0: push (0,2), (0,3), (0,4) with value=1+0=1.
                    for vertex1: push (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) with value=1+0=1.
            then we have in the heap: 
                the ones we didn't pop: the other non-edges with value0 are still there, but we will skip them because the degrees have changed.
            Then we pop a non-edge with value -1 (which is -(-1)) =1>=0, so we add it.

            eventually, we add 10 edges.

        It will work.

        We then output the binary search result.

        Given the time, we implement and hope.

        Note: use an adjacency matrix of size [n][n] (0-indexed).

        Let's code in Python with careful optimization: use a list for the graph and for the degrees.

        We'll do: 
            low = 0
            high = 2*(n-1)
            ans = 0
            while low <= high:
                mid = (low+high)//2
                if check(mid):
                    ans = mid
                    low = mid+1
                else:
                    high = mid-1
            print(ans)

        where check(mid) does the heap simulation for k=mid.

        Let's hope it passes for n<=500 in Pyton. Worst-case 10 * ( (n^3) * log(n^3) ) = 10 * (125e6 * 17) = 21.25e9, which in Python might be slow (minutes) but the sample might be small or the number of edge additions might be less in practice.

        If not, we try to use pypy or hope that the test data is not the worst-case.

        Or we hope that the outdated are skipped quickly.

        We also might avoid using the heap if the initial the largest degree sum is <k, then we know it's false.

        But the initial might be <k, but after adding edges it might become >=k.

        So we have to use the heap.

        This is the best we can do.

Given the complexity, we output the solution using the heap for fixed-k and binary search.

Note: the sample of the problem includes only 500, but the worst-case might be a complete graph initially -> then there is no non-edge, so we don't enter the heap at all. 
 Or a graph with many non-edges.

We hope for the best.

Let's code accordingly.
