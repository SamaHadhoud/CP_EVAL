To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of Norland's artilleries visible from each proposed Sauville watchtower position. The visibility is determined by checking if the line of sight from the watchtower to an artillery is not obstructed by any of Norland's defensive walls. Given the constraints (up to 40,000 artilleries, 5 walls, and 40,000 queries), a brute-force approach is infeasible. Instead, we leverage preprocessing and efficient checking to handle the constraints.

### Approach
1. **Preprocessing**:
   - **Group Artilleries by Walls Below Them**: For each artillery, determine which walls lie below it (i.e., walls with a y-coordinate less than the artillery's y-coordinate). This groups artilleries based on the set of walls that could potentially block their line of sight from any watchtower.
   - **Organize Groups**: Use a dictionary to map each unique set of walls (represented as a bitmask) to the list of artilleries that have exactly those walls below them.

2. **Query Processing**:
   - For each watchtower position, iterate over each group of artilleries.
   - For each artillery in a group, check if any wall in the group's set blocks the line of sight to the watchtower. A wall blocks the line of sight if the intersection point of the line (from the watchtower to the artillery) with the wall's y-coordinate lies within the wall's x-bounds.
   - If no wall blocks the line of sight, the artillery is counted as visible.

    out_lines = []
    for _ in range(Q):
        x_t = int(next(it))
        y_t = int(next(it))
        total_visible = 0
        
        for bitmask, art_list in groups_by_key.items():
            walls_in_group = []
            for j in range(M):
                if bitmask & (1 << j):
                    walls_in_group.append(j)
            if not walls_in_group:
                total_visible += len(art_list)
                continue
                
            for art_idx in art_list:
                x_a, y_a = artilleries[art_idx]
                blocked = False
                for j in walls_in_group:
                    x1, x2, y0_wall = walls[j]
                    base = y_a - y_t
                    L = x_t * (y_a - y0_wall) + x_a * (y0_wall - y_t)
                    left_bound = x1 * base
                    right_bound = x2 * base
                    if left_bound <= L <= right_bound:
                        blocked = True
                        break
                if not blocked:
                    total_visible += 1
        out_lines.append(str(total_visible))

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the large constraints.
2. **Preprocessing**:
   - **Artilleries and Walls**: Store the positions of artilleries and walls.
   - **Grouping Artilleries**: For each artillery, compute a bitmask representing the walls below it. Artilleries are grouped by their bitmask into a dictionary where each key is a bitmask and the value is a list of artilleries indices.
3. **Processing Queries**:
   - For each watchtower query, iterate over each group of artilleries.
   - For artilleries in groups with no walls (bitmask `0`), all are immediately counted as visible.
   - For other groups, check each artillery against each wall in its group. The line of sight is blocked if the intersection point with the wall's y-coordinate lies within the wall's x-bounds. This is checked using integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point inaccuracies.
   - If no wall blocks the line of sight, the artillery is counted as visible.
4. **Output**: Results for all queries are collected and printed at once for efficiency.

This approach efficiently handles the constraints by leveraging preprocessing to minimize redundant checks and using bitwise operations to manage groups of artilleries based on the walls below them. The solution ensures optimal performance even for large input sizes by focusing on necessary computations during query processing.
