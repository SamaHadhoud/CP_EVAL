To solve this problem, we need to find a binary string \( T \) of the same length as the given binary string \( S \) such that the edit distance between \( S \) and \( T \) is greater than half the length of \( S \). The key insight here is that the bitwise complement of \( S \) (i.e., flipping each bit in \( S \)) will always satisfy this condition. 

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to generate a binary string \( T \) such that the edit distance between \( S \) and \( T \) exceeds half the length of \( S \). The edit distance is minimized when \( T \) is similar to \( S \), but we need to maximize it. The maximum possible edit distance between two strings of the same length is achieved when every character in \( T \) differs from the corresponding character in \( S \). This maximum distance is exactly the length of \( S \), which is always greater than half its length (for any non-empty string).
2. **Intuition**: By flipping each bit in \( S \) (changing '0' to '1' and '1' to '0'), we ensure that every character in \( T \) is different from the corresponding character in \( S \). This means the edit distance will be equal to the length of \( S \), which is greater than \( |S|/2 \).
3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves iterating through each character of the input string \( S \), flipping each bit, and constructing the output string \( T \).
4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in \( O(n) \) time, where \( n \) is the length of \( S \), since each character is processed exactly once. The space complexity is also \( O(n) \) to store the resulting string \( T \).

### Solution Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string s;
    cin >> s;
    string t = "";
    for (char c : s) {
        if (c == '0') {
            t += '1';
        } else {
            t += '0';
        }
    }
    cout << t << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input binary string \( S \) is read from standard input.
2. **Constructing Complement**: For each character in \( S \):
   - If the character is '0', append '1' to \( T \).
   - If the character is '1', append '0' to \( T \).
3. **Output**: The constructed string \( T \) is printed, which is the bitwise complement of \( S \).

This approach ensures that every character in \( T \) differs from the corresponding character in \( S \), resulting in an edit distance equal to the length of \( S \). Since the length of \( S \) is always greater than half its length (for \( |S| \geq 1 \)), the solution meets the problem's requirements efficiently.
