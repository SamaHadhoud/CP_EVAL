 We are going to output the complement of the input string.
 For example, if input is "0011", output is "1100".
 Why? Because the edit distance between S and its complement is |S|, which is always > |S|/2 for |S|>=1.

 Steps:
 1. Read the binary string S.
 2. Traverse each character in S and flip each bit: '0' becomes '1', and '1' becomes '0'.
 3. Output the new string.

 Time Complexity: O(n) where n = |S|
 Space Complexity: O(n) for the output string.

 Note: Since |S| is at most 2000, this is efficient.

 Let's code accordingly.
