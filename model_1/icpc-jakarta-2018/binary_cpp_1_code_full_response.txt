To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of bits to remove from a given binary string such that the resulting subsequence, when interpreted as a binary number, does not have leading zeros and is at most a given integer \( K \). The solution involves checking for the longest possible valid subsequence (without leading zeros and \(\leq K\)) and then calculating the minimal removals as the difference between the original string length and the length of this subsequence.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires converting a binary string into its decimal representation without exceeding \( K \). The key insight is that the longest valid subsequence (without leading zeros and \(\leq K\)) will minimize the number of bits to remove. 
2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: For each possible subsequence length \( L \) (from the original string length down to 1), we use DP to check if a valid subsequence of that length exists:
   - **Base Case (j=1)**: Each bit in the string is a valid subsequence (0 or 1).
   - **Extension (j ≥ 2)**: For each position \( i \) in the string, we extend valid subsequences of length \( j-1 \) ending before \( i \) by appending the current bit. The new value is computed as \( \text{value} \times 2 + \text{bit} \), ensuring it does not exceed \( K \).
3. **Efficiency**: By iterating \( L \) from the maximum possible (string length) down to 1, the first valid \( L \) found gives the solution \( \text{original length} - L \). This approach efficiently checks all possible lengths in \( O(n^3) \) time, feasible since \( n \leq 60 \).

### Solution Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

typedef unsigned long long ull;

int main() {
    ull K;
    string S;
    cin >> K;
    cin >> S;
    int n = S.size();

    ull BIG = K + 1;

    for (int L = n; L >= 1; L--) {
        if (L == 1) {
            cout << n - 1 << endl;
            return 0;
        }

        vector<ull> dp_prev(n, BIG);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (S[i] == '0') {
                dp_prev[i] = 0;
            } else {
                dp_prev[i] = 1;
            }
        }

        for (int j = 2; j <= L; j++) {
            vector<ull> dp_curr(n, BIG);
            ull min_so_far = BIG;

            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (min_so_far != BIG) {
                    ull bit_val = (S[i] == '1') ? 1 : 0;
                    ull candidate = min_so_far * 2 + bit_val;
                    if (candidate <= K) {
                        dp_curr[i] = candidate;
                    }
                }

                if (dp_prev[i] != BIG && dp_prev[i] <= K) {
                    if (dp_prev[i] != 0) {
                        if (min_so_far == BIG) {
                            min_so_far = dp_prev[i];
                        } else {
                            if (dp_prev[i] < min_so_far) {
                                min_so_far = dp_prev[i];
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            dp_prev = dp_curr;
        }

        for (ull val : dp_prev) {
            if (val <= K) {
                cout << n - L << endl;
                return 0;
            }
        }
    }

    cout << n - 1 << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: Read \( K \) and the binary string \( S \). Initialize \( \text{BIG} \) as \( K + 1 \) to represent values exceeding \( K \).
2. **Iterate Subsequence Lengths**: For each possible subsequence length \( L \) from \( n \) (original length) down to 1:
   - **Base Case Handling (L=1)**: Always valid (single bit 0 or 1), output \( n - 1 \) removals.
   - **DP for Longer Subsequences (L ≥ 2)**:
     - **Base State (j=1)**: Initialize DP values for single bits (0 for '0', 1 for '1').
     - **Build Longer Subsequences (j=2 to L)**: For each position \( i \), extend valid subsequences (non-zero and \(\leq K\)) ending before \( i \) by appending the current bit. Track the minimal valid value for efficient extension.
3. **Check Validity**: After processing each \( L \), if any valid subsequence (value \(\leq K\)) exists, output \( n - L \) (minimal removals) and exit.
4. **Fallback**: If no valid subsequence is found for \( L \geq 2 \), default to \( L = 1 \) (output \( n - 1 \) removals).

This approach efficiently checks all possible valid subsequences in descending order of length, ensuring optimal performance for the given constraints.
