### Approach
The problem requires finding the minimum number of bits to remove from a binary string \( S \) (with no leading zeros) such that the resulting binary number (also with no leading zeros) is at most \( K \). The solution involves checking for the longest possible subsequence of \( S \) that forms a valid binary number (without leading zeros) and has a decimal value \(\leq K\). The minimal removals will then be \( |S| \) minus the length of this subsequence.

#### Key Insight
- **Subsequence Construction**: The solution constructs valid binary numbers from subsequences of \( S \) of decreasing lengths (from \( |S| \) down to 1). For each length \( L \), it checks if there exists a subsequence of \( S \) of length \( L \) that forms a binary number \(\leq K\) without leading zeros.
- **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: For each \( L \), a DP approach is used where:
  - **Base Case (\( j = 1 \))**: Each bit in \( S \) is a valid subsequence (0 or 1).
  - **Extension (\( j \geq 2 \))**: For each position \( i \) in \( S \), the minimal value achievable for a subsequence of length \( j \) ending at \( i \) is derived by extending subsequences of length \( j-1 \) ending at positions before \( i \). The value is computed as \( \text{value} \times 2 + \text{bit} \), ensuring it does not exceed \( K \).
- **Efficiency**: By iterating \( L \) from \( |S| \) down to 1, the solution efficiently finds the largest \( L \) for which a valid subsequence exists, minimizing the number of removals (\( |S| - L \)).

### Solution Code
```python
import sys

def main():
    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()
    if not data: 
        return
    K = int(data[0].strip())
    S = data[1].strip()
    n = len(S)
    BIG = K + 1

    for L in range(n, 0, -1):
        dp_prev = [0] * n
        for i in range(n):
            if S[i] == '1':
                dp_prev[i] = 1
            else:
                dp_prev[i] = 0
        
        if L == 1:
            print(n - 1)
            return
        
        for j in range(2, L + 1):
            dp_curr = [BIG] * n
            min_so_far = BIG
            
            for i in range(n):
                if min_so_far <= K:
                    bit_val = 1 if S[i] == '1' else 0
                    candidate = min_so_far * 2 + bit_val
                    if candidate <= K:
                        dp_curr[i] = candidate
                
                if dp_prev[i] > 0 and dp_prev[i] <= K:
                    if min_so_far == BIG:
                        min_so_far = dp_prev[i]
                    else:
                        if dp_prev[i] < min_so_far:
                            min_so_far = dp_prev[i]
            
            dp_prev = dp_curr
        
        for value in dp_prev:
            if value <= K:
                print(n - L)
                return
    
    print(n - 1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer \( K \) and a binary string \( S \).
2. **Initialization**: A constant `BIG` (set to \( K + 1 \)) is used to represent values exceeding \( K \).
3. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths \( L \)**:
   - Start from the longest possible subsequence (length \( |S| \)) down to 1.
   - **Base Case Handling (\( L = 1 \))**: Any single bit (0 or 1) is valid since \( K \geq 1 \). The answer is \( |S| - 1 \).
4. **Dynamic Programming for \( L \geq 2 \)**:
   - **State Initialization**: `dp_prev` stores values of subsequences of length \( j-1 \). Initialize for \( j = 1 \).
   - **Building Longer Subsequences**: For each \( j \) from 2 to \( L \):
     - Compute `dp_curr` for subsequences of length \( j \) by extending subsequences from `dp_prev`.
     - Use `min_so_far` to track the minimal valid value from previous positions to ensure efficient computation.
     - Update `dp_prev` for the next iteration.
5. **Check Valid Subsequence**: After processing length \( L \), if any value in `dp_prev` is \(\leq K\), output \( |S| - L \) as the minimal removals.
6. **Fallback to \( L = 1 \)**: If no longer valid subsequence is found, the solution defaults to leaving one bit (0 or 1), resulting in \( |S| - 1 \) removals.

This approach efficiently checks all possible subsequence lengths in descending order, ensuring optimal performance with a time complexity of \( O(n^3) \), feasible given \( n \leq 60 \). The space complexity is \( O(n) \) per iteration, optimizing memory usage.
