To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of bits to remove from a given binary string such that the resulting binary number (without leading zeros) is no larger than a given integer \( K \). The solution involves finding the longest possible subsequence of the binary string that forms a valid binary number (without leading zeros) and whose decimal value is at most \( K \). The minimal number of removals is then the difference between the original string's length and the length of this subsequence.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires converting a binary string into its decimal representation without exceeding \( K \). The key insight is that the longest valid subsequence (without leading zeros) that meets the value constraint will minimize the number of removals.
2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: For each possible subsequence length \( L \) (from the original length down to 1), we use a dynamic programming approach to check if there exists a valid subsequence of that length:
   - **Base Case (\( L = 1 \))**: Any single bit (0 or 1) is valid since \( K \geq 1 \).
   - **Longer Subsequences (\( L \geq 2 \))**: The first bit must be '1' to avoid leading zeros. We build subsequences of increasing lengths by extending valid shorter subsequences.
3. **Efficiency**: By iterating from the longest possible subsequence down to the shortest, we can exit early once the first valid subsequence is found, ensuring optimal performance. The DP approach efficiently checks subsequences by maintaining the minimal values encountered to avoid redundant calculations.

### Solution Code
```python
import sys

def main():
    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()
    if not data: 
        return
    K = int(data[0].strip())
    S = data[1].strip()
    n = len(S)
    BIG = K + 1
    
    for L in range(n, 0, -1):
        if L == 1:
            print(n - 1)
            return
        else:
            dp_prev = [BIG] * n
            for i in range(n):
                if S[i] == '1':
                    dp_prev[i] = 1
                    
            for j in range(2, L + 1):
                dp_curr = [BIG] * n
                min_prev = BIG
                for i in range(n):
                    if min_prev != BIG:
                        bit_val = 1 if S[i] == '1' else 0
                        candidate = min_prev * 2 + bit_val
                        if candidate <= K:
                            dp_curr[i] = candidate
                    if dp_prev[i] != BIG and dp_prev[i] < min_prev:
                        min_prev = dp_prev[i]
                
                if all(x == BIG for x in dp_curr):
                    break
                dp_prev = dp_curr
            else:
                for value in dp_prev:
                    if value <= K:
                        print(n - L)
                        return
    print(n - 1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer \( K \) and a binary string \( S \).
2. **Initialization**: A constant `BIG` (set to \( K + 1 \)) is used to represent values exceeding \( K \).
3. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths \( L \)**:
   - **Base Case Handling (\( L = 1 \))**: Any single bit (0 or 1) is valid, so the answer is \( |S| - 1 \).
   - **Dynamic Programming for \( L \geq 2 \)**:
     - **State Initialization**: `dp_prev` stores values of subsequences of length \( j-1 \). Initialize for \( j = 1 \) with '1's set to 1 and '0's ignored.
     - **Building Longer Subsequences**: For each \( j \) from 2 to \( L \):
       - Compute `dp_curr` for subsequences of length \( j \) by extending subsequences from `dp_prev`.
       - Use `min_prev` to track the minimal valid value from previous positions to ensure efficient computation.
       - Update `dp_prev` for the next iteration.
4. **Check Valid Subsequence**: After processing length \( L \), if any value in `dp_prev` is \( \leq K \), output \( |S| - L \) as the minimal removals.
5. **Fallback to \( L = 1 \)**: If no longer valid subsequence is found, the solution defaults to leaving one bit, resulting in \( |S| - 1 \) removals.

This approach efficiently checks all possible subsequence lengths in descending order, ensuring optimal performance with a time complexity of \( O(n^3) \), which is feasible given \( n \leq 60 \). The space complexity is \( O(n) \) per iteration, optimizing memory usage.
