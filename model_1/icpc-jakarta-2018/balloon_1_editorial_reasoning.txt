We are given:
  N: number of tasks
  M: total competition time (minutes)
  Array A[1..N]: time for Ayu to solve each task (in order)
  Array B[1..N]: time for Budi to solve each task (in order)

Both contestants must solve the tasks in order.

Ayu's progress:
  Let T0 = 0.
  Ayu solves task 1 at time T1 = A1.
  Then task 2 at time T2 = A1 + A2.
  And so on: the k-th task is solved at time S_k = A1 + A2 + ... + A_k.

Budi's progress without any disturbance:
  He solves task 1 at time U1 = B1.
  Then task 2 at time U2 = B1+B2, etc.

However, Ayu can pop balloons (which she gets immediately when she solves a task) at integer minutes to disrupt Budi.

Effect of a balloon pop at time t:
  If Budi is working on a task that takes B minutes and he started at time s, then without disturbance he would finish at s+B.
  But if a balloon pops at time t (with s < t <= s+B), then Budi has to restart that task. The restart happens immediately: at time t, he abandons the current attempt and starts again. Therefore, the new projected finish time for that task becomes t + B.

Note: if multiple pops happen during one task, each pop causes a restart. The restarts are cumulative.

Goal: 
  We want Ayu to have strictly more solved tasks than Budi.

How to plan the balloon pops?
  Let X = number of tasks Ayu solves. Then she must have S_X <= M and S_{X+1} > M (if it exists).
  Similarly, let Y = number of tasks Budi solves. We require X > Y.

But note: the balloon pops can delay Budi so that he solves fewer tasks.

We can try for each possible X (from 0 to N) that Ayu solves. For each X, we know:
  - Ayu solves X tasks: we have the cumulative time S_X = A1+A2+...+A_X <= M, and if X < N then S_{X+1} > M.

Then we want to use balloon pops to make sure that Budi solves at most Y tasks, with Y < X.

How to compute the minimal time for Budi to complete k tasks under balloon pops?
  Note: Ayu can pop a balloon only at the moment she receives it (or later, but she can't pop before she has it) and at integer minutes. However, we are allowed to choose any integer minute as long as we have the balloon by then. But note: the popping must be at an integer minute in [1, M].

But note: Ayu gets a balloon when she solves a task. So she has one balloon at time S_i (for each task i that she solves). However, she can pop multiple balloons at different times arbitrarily as long as the popping times are increasing and at integer minutes and not exceeding M.

The problem becomes: 
  We can choose a set of popping times (a set of integers) from the set of times we have (we have a balloon at each S_i for i=1..X) and we can choose any integer minute from S_i up to M (and we can use each balloon only once). 

How does a popping time affect Budi?
  The pops cause Budi to restart the current task. Therefore, we can model Budi's progress as:

  Let T be the set of popping times (sorted in increasing order). Budi's progress on the j-th task: 
    He starts at time F_{j-1} (where F0 = 0).
    He will finish at F_j = F_{j-1} + B_j, unless there is a pop during [F_{j-1}, F_j].

  But if there are pops in the interval (F_{j-1}, F_j], then each pop at time t in that interval causes a restart. The effect: 
      Initially, the task is scheduled to take B_j minutes. 
      At the first pop at time t1, the remaining time becomes B_j again (so the new finish time becomes t1 + B_j).
      Then at the next pop at time t2 (if it falls in [t1, t1+B_j]), then the finish time becomes t2 + B_j, and so on.

  Therefore, the total time for the j-th task is: 
      (t1 - F_{j-1}) + (t2 - t1) + ... + (t_k - t_{k-1}) + (F_j - t_k)   ??? 
  But note: each time a pop occurs, the entire task time B_j must be repeated from the moment of the pop.

  Actually: 
      The first segment: from F_{j-1} to t1: that's a duration of (t1 - F_{j-1}), but then the pop happens and we restart. Then from t1 to t2: (t2 - t1), and then restart. And then the last segment: from the last pop time t_k to the new finish time t_k+B_j. 
      So the total time for the task is: (t1 - F_{j-1}) + (t2 - t1) + ... + (t_k - t_{k-1}) + B_j 
          = (t_k - F_{j-1}) + B_j.

  However, note that the pops that happen during the task might be more than one? Actually, the above formula does not depend on the number of pops? That doesn't seem right.

  Let me reexamine: 
      Start at F_{j-1}. 
      Pop at t1: then we restart at t1. Now we need B_j minutes from t1. 
      Then at t2 (which is in [t1, t1+B_j]): we restart again at t2. Then we need B_j minutes from t2.
      ...
      The last pop at t_k: then we restart at t_k and then we need B_j minutes from t_k. 
      Therefore, the finish time for the task is t_k + B_j.

  So the entire time spent on the task is: (t_k + B_j) - F_{j-1}.

  But note: the pops must occur in the intervals of the task. The first pop must be in [F_{j-1}+1, F_{j-1}+B_j]? Actually, if it happens at F_{j-1} (exactly the start) then it's not allowed because the problem says: "if a balloon pops at the same time Budi supposed to solve the task" meaning that at the scheduled finish time? Actually, the problem states: if at the moment when Budi would have finished (without pop) then the pop at that exact time causes a restart.

  Therefore, we can interpret: 
      For the j-th task, any pop that occurs at time t such that F_{j-1} < t <= F_{j-1}+B_j (without any prior pop) would cause the task to finish at t+B_j. 
      But if multiple pops occur during the same task, then the last pop (the one that happens last in the interval) is the one that determines the finish time? Why? Because each pop resets the progress and sets the new base time to the pop time. Then the next pop happens in the new interval [pop_time, pop_time+B_j]. So the finish time is the last pop time in the entire task plus B_j.

  Therefore, the entire time for the j-th task is: 
      F_j = (last pop time in the task) + B_j, if there is at least one pop during the task.
      Otherwise, F_j = F_{j-1} + B_j.

  But note: if there are multiple pops, then the pops that are not the last in the task become irrelevant? Actually, no: because the last pop sets the base. The intermediate pops only cause restarts that push the base to the next pop.

  Therefore, for the j-th task, the minimal finish time we can force (if we have pops available) is not just the last pop? Actually, we can choose which pops to use and when. But note: we are allowed to use as many balloons as we have (but we have only X balloons). However, we can assign multiple pops to one task? 

  The key is: we can use any subset of the balloons we have. And we can assign the pops arbitrarily to any integer minute we wish (as long as we have the balloon by then). So we can choose to pop multiple balloons during one task? Yes, if we have multiple balloons.

  How to minimize the number of tasks Budi completes? Actually, we don't care about the exact time for each task? We care about the maximal k such that the cumulative time (with the pops) for Budi to complete k tasks is <= M.

  However, note: the popping events are global. We can use any balloon we have (by the time we pop) at any integer minute. We are not constrained to pop a balloon only during the task we wish to disrupt? But we are constrained: we get the balloon at time S_i (when Ayu solves task i). Therefore, we cannot pop a balloon at a time before S_i.

  So the problem reduces to:

  We have X balloons available at times S_1, S_2, ..., S_X (which are the times Ayu solves the tasks). We can choose a set of popping times T = {t1, t2, ..., tK} (with K <= X) such that each t_i is an integer in [S_j, M] for some j (but actually we don't care which balloon is used as long as the popping time is at least the time the balloon was received). And we can assign these popping times arbitrarily to disrupt Budi.

  How do we simulate Budi's progress with a set of popping times?

  We can simulate task by task:

      Let current_time = 0 (Budi's start time for the first task).
      For task j from 1 to N:
          Without any pop, Budi would finish at current_time + B_j.
          But if we have any pop in the interval (current_time, current_time+B_j], then the finish time for the task is: 
                last_pop_time_in_this_interval + B_j
          However, we can choose the popping times arbitrarily (as long as we have balloons and the popping times are in [min_available_balloon_time, M] and increasing).

      But note: we are allowed to choose the popping times arbitrarily (subject to the constraints). Therefore, we can choose to pop at any integer time we wish as long as we have a balloon by that time (i.e., there is at least one solved task by Ayu that gives a balloon at time <= the popping time). And we cannot pop the same balloon twice.

  Therefore, the problem becomes: can we assign some of the balloons (which we have at times S_1, S_2, ..., S_X) to be popped at integer times (with the popping times being at least the time the balloon is received and at most M) such that Budi completes at most X-1 tasks (since we require Ayu solves X tasks and Budi solves at most X-1)?

  But note: we require Ayu solves X tasks, and we require Budi solves at most X-1 tasks.

  We can try for each X (from 1 to N) that Ayu can achieve (S_X <= M) and then check if we can prevent Budi from solving X tasks (i.e., Budi solves at most X-1 tasks). We want the minimal X such that this is possible? Actually, we want to know if there exists an X for which this is possible. However, note: we can choose the popping strategy arbitrarily. And we are allowed to output any valid configuration.

  How to check for a fixed X?

      Step 1: Ayu solves X tasks at time S_X = A1+A2+...+A_X <= M. (If S_X > M, then X is not achievable.)

      Step 2: We need to prevent Budi from solving the X-th task. That is, we want the total time for Budi to complete X tasks to be > M.

      How to compute the minimal total time for Budi to complete k tasks under our popping strategy? Actually, we are free to assign pops arbitrarily (as long as we have the balloons). Therefore, we can design a popping strategy to maximize the delay on Budi? But we want to prevent him from completing X tasks. So we want to maximize the time he takes to complete the first X tasks (so that it exceeds M). However, we are constrained by the balloons: we have only X balloons (since Ayu solved X tasks) and they are available at times S_1, ..., S_X.

      Alternatively, we can think greedily: to maximize the disruption, we should use the balloons as late as possible? But note: we want to delay Budi as much as possible? Actually, we don't need to maximize the delay arbitrarily; we only need to make sure that the finish time for the X-th task by Budi is > M.

      However, we can also use the balloons to disrupt multiple tasks? And note: we can use multiple balloons in one task to cause multiple restarts? 

      How much can we delay a single task? 
          Suppose we use k balloons on task j. Then the finish time for task j is: last_pop_time + B_j, where last_pop_time is the last pop time we use for this task. The pop times must be in the interval (F_{j-1}, F_{j-1}+B_j]? Actually, no: the first pop must be in (F_{j-1}, F_{j-1}+B_j], then the next pop must be in (last_pop_time, last_pop_time+B_j]? 

      But note: we can choose the popping times arbitrarily as long as we have a balloon by that time. So for a task j, if we want to assign k pops, we can choose the last pop arbitrarily? However, we are constrained by the balloon availability: we cannot pop a balloon before we get it.

      Actually, we can model the disruption as: 
          For task j, we can assign a set of pop times T_j. The finish time for the task is: 
                F_j = max( F_{j-1} + B_j,  max_{t in T_j} t + B_j )
          Why? Because if we pop at time t, then the task restarts at t and takes B_j minutes. The finish time must be at least t+B_j. And if we have multiple pops, the last pop (the largest t) is the one that sets the base.

      But note: if we have a pop at t, then we must have t > F_{j-1} (because the task hasn't started before F_{j-1}) and we must have a balloon at time <= t. And we can only use each balloon once.

      However, we can also disrupt multiple tasks. The overall Budi's finish time for the X-th task is F_X, and we want F_X > M.

      How to maximize F_X? 
          We have X balloons. We can assign each balloon to a task arbitrarily. But note: if we assign a balloon to task j, then the pop time t must be at least F_{j-1}+1 (so that it disrupts task j) and at most M (and we must have a balloon available by time t). Also, if we assign multiple balloons to the same task j, then the last pop time (the one that counts) for task j is the maximum pop time assigned to that task.

          Therefore, if we assign a set of balloons to task j, then the finish time for task j is: 
                F_j = max( F_{j-1} + B_j,  (max_{pop assigned to j} pop_time) + B_j )

          But note: we can also leave a task without any pop: then F_j = F_{j-1} + B_j.

      How to maximize the overall finish time? We can assign the balloons arbitrarily to the tasks. However, the disruption in one task does not affect the start time of the next? Actually, the start time of task j is the finish time of task j-1. So if we delay task j, then task j+1 starts later, which might give us an opportunity to use later balloons (that we get later) to disrupt task j+1.

      Therefore, the tasks are sequential. We can plan the pops as follows:

          Let F_0 = 0.
          For j from 1 to k (where k is the number of tasks Budi is supposed to do) we do:

              Let base = F_{j-1} + B_j.

              Now, we can assign zero or more pops (from the available balloons) to task j. The effect: the finish time F_j is max( base, (max_pop_time_in_task_j) + B_j ).

          But note: the popping times we assign to task j must be in the interval (F_{j-1}, base]? Actually, no: because if we assign a pop at time t that is greater than base, then it would not disrupt task j? Because the task j is already finished at base. Therefore, to disrupt task j, the pop must occur while Budi is working on task j, i.e., in the interval (F_{j-1}, base]. However, if we assign a pop at time t > base, then it doesn't affect task j. So we would not use such a pop for task j.

          Therefore, for task j, we are limited to pops that are in (F_{j-1}, base] and also at least the earliest balloon we have (but we have balloons at S_1, S_2, ... S_X, so the earliest pop we can do is min(S_i) but actually we can choose which balloons to use when).

      However, we have a set of balloons available at times S_1, S_2, ... S_X. We can use a balloon only once. And we can use a balloon for any task j as long as the popping time we assign (which must be at least the balloon time) is in the interval (F_{j-1}, F_{j-1}+B_j]? 

      Actually, we can use a balloon that we get at time S_i to pop at any time t >= S_i and t <= M. But to disrupt task j, we must have t in (F_{j-1}, F_{j-1}+B_j]. Therefore, the balloon must be available at a time <= F_{j-1}+B_j (so that we can pop at a time in that interval).

      Therefore, the constraint for using a balloon (available at time s) to disrupt task j is: 
            F_{j-1} < s <= F_{j-1}+B_j   ??? 
          Actually, we can pop at any time t in [max(s, F_{j-1}+1), min(M, F_{j-1}+B_j)]? 

      But note: we can postpone popping the balloon until a later time? However, if we postpone beyond F_{j-1}+B_j, then it doesn't disrupt task j. So if we want to disrupt task j, we must pop the balloon at a time in (F_{j-1}, F_{j-1}+B_j] and the balloon must be available by that time.

      Therefore, the balloon must be available by F_{j-1}+B_j, i.e., s <= F_{j-1}+B_j.

      And we can only use the balloon for one task.

      Now, if we assign a balloon to task j, we can choose the popping time arbitrarily in the interval [max(s, F_{j-1}+1), F_{j-1}+B_j]. To maximize the disruption (i.e., to maximize F_j), we would set the popping time as late as possible: min(M, F_{j-1}+B_j). But note: we are not forced to maximize the disruption per task, but overall we want to maximize the total time for Budi to complete the first X tasks? Actually, we want to prevent Budi from completing X tasks. So we want to maximize the finish time of the X-th task.

      Therefore, the best we can do for a task j is: 
          We can assign one or more balloons to task j. However, note that if we assign multiple balloons to the same task, only the last pop matters. Therefore, we only need to assign one balloon to task j (the one that allows the latest pop) to set F_j = min(M, F_{j-1}+B_j) + B_j? Actually, no: the pop time t we choose must be at most F_{j-1}+B_j. Then F_j = t + B_j. The maximum t we can set for task j is min(M, F_{j-1}+B_j). Then F_j = min(M, F_{j-1}+B_j) + B_j? But wait: if we set t = F_{j-1}+B_j, then F_j = F_{j-1} + 2*B_j.

      However, if we assign multiple balloons to task j, we can push the finish time even more? 

          Example: 
            Task j: B_j = 10, F_{j-1} = 0.
            We have two balloons: one at time 5 and one at time 15 (but note: we cannot use the one at time 15 for this task because 15>0+10? so not in the interval). So we can use the balloon at time 5. Then we pop at time 5 -> finish time = 5+10=15. 
            But if we pop at time 10 (the deadline) then we get finish time 20.

          How to use two balloons? 
            First pop at time 5: then Budi restarts at 5, so now the projected finish time is 15. But then we can pop again at time 10 (which is in [5,15])? Then we set the finish time to 10+10=20.

          Therefore, with two balloons we can achieve F_j=20, which is more than with one balloon (which would be at most 20 if we pop at 10). So how do we achieve the maximum disruption for one task? 
            We can pop at every integer minute? But we are constrained by the balloon availability.

          Actually, the maximum disruption for task j is achieved by popping as many times as we can (with the available balloons) at the last possible moment: at time F_{j-1}+B_j. Why? Because if we pop at time t, then the finish time is t+B_j. The maximum t we can set is F_{j-1}+B_j. And if we pop multiple times at the same time? But the problem says we cannot pop more than one balloon at the same minute.

          Therefore, we can pop at time F_{j-1}+B_j only once. Then we can also pop at time F_{j-1}+B_j - 1? But then the finish time would be (F_{j-1}+B_j - 1) + B_j = F_{j-1} + 2*B_j - 1. However, if we pop at F_{j-1}+B_j, we get F_j = F_{j-1} + 2*B_j.

          So the maximum finish time for task j is F_{j-1} + (k+1)*B_j, where k is the number of pops we use? Actually, no: because each pop resets the progress. The finish time is the last pop time plus B_j. To get the maximum finish time, we want the last pop time to be as large as possible. The largest pop time we can set is min(M, F_{j-1}+B_j). Therefore, the maximum finish time we can force for task j is min(M, F_{j-1}+B_j) + B_j.

          But wait: if we have multiple balloons, we can pop at multiple times? The last pop time is the one that matters. So we only need one balloon per task to set the last pop time to min(M, F_{j-1}+B_j). The other pops in the same task do not help to increase the finish time (because the last pop is what sets the base). Therefore, we only need at most one balloon per task to maximize the disruption for that task.

      Therefore, the best we can do for a task is to assign one balloon that allows a pop at time t = min(M, F_{j-1}+B_j). Then F_j = t + B_j = min(M, F_{j-1}+B_j) + B_j.

      However, what if we don't have a balloon available at time <= min(M, F_{j-1}+B_j)? Then we cannot achieve that. Then we can try the next best: pop at the latest time we can with the available balloons. That is, we choose the largest popping time t we can such that:
          t is at most min(M, F_{j-1}+B_j)
          and we have a balloon available at time <= t (and we haven't used that balloon for another task).

      Therefore, to maximize the disruption, we should assign the balloons that are available earlier to later tasks? Actually, we want to use the balloons that become available later for the tasks where we can pop at a time as close to the deadline (F_{j-1}+B_j) as possible.

      Algorithm for fixed X (Ayu solves X tasks) and we want to prevent Budi from solving X tasks:

          We have a set of balloons: available at times S_1, S_2, ... S_X. We can sort these balloons: they are already in increasing order (since Ayu solves tasks in order).

          We simulate Budi's tasks j=1,2,...,X (because we want to prevent him from completing X tasks, so we simulate up to X tasks and we want the finish time for the X-th task to be > M).

          Let F_0 = 0.
          For j in 1..X:
              base = F_{j-1} + B_j   [the natural finish time without pops]

              Now, we can use one balloon to set the finish time to min(M, base) + B_j? 
              But wait: we might have multiple balloons? Actually, we only need one per task to get the maximum disruption. However, we have X balloons and X tasks? But we might use more than one balloon per task? But as argued, one balloon per task is enough to set the finish time to min(M, base) + B_j. 

          However, what if min(M, base) + B_j <= M? Then we haven't achieved our goal. We need to use more than one balloon per task? 

          Example: 
              M=20, base=10, B_j=5.
              Using one balloon: pop at min(20,10)=10 -> finish time = 15.
              Then we can use a second balloon: but note we can only pop one balloon per minute. We can pop at 10 and then at 15? 
                  First pop at 10: then Budi restarts and the new base becomes 10 (the pop time) and the new deadline is 10+5=15.
                  Then we pop at 15: then the finish time becomes 15+5=20.
              Then we can use a third balloon? pop at 20? but then the deadline for the task becomes 25? but 20 is the contest end. However, the problem states: if Budi is supposed to finish at 20 (without pop) and we pop at 20, then he has to restart and then he finishes at 30? But the contest ends at 20? Actually, the problem says: "if a balloon pops at the same time Budi supposed to solve the task (i.e. at the 10th minute in this example), then Budi will also not solve that task. Therefore, Budi has to spend another 10 minutes (for a total of 10+10=20 minutes)". 

          But note: when we pop at 15, the task was supposed to finish at 15? Then we pop at 15, so he doesn't solve at 15? Then he has to restart? Then the finish time becomes 15+5=20.

          How about popping at 15 and then at 20? 
              At 15: restart -> finish at 20? Then at 20: we pop? Then he doesn't solve at 20? Then he restarts and finishes at 25. So the finish time becomes 25.

          Therefore, we can use multiple balloons per task to cause multiple restarts. The finish time for task j with k pops is: 
              Let the pops be at times t1, t2, ..., tk (with t1 < t2 < ... < tk) and tk <= F_{j-1}+B_j? Actually, no: the first pop must be in [F_{j-1}+1, F_{j-1}+B_j], then the next pop must be in [t1+1, t1+B_j], and so on. The finish time is tk + B_j.

          But note: we can choose the pops arbitrarily as long as the balloon is available by the pop time. The maximum tk we can achieve is limited by M and by the cumulative effect: the last pop must be at most min(M, F_{j-1} + (k+1)*B_j) ??? 

          Actually, to get a pop at time t, we must have the balloon available at time <= t. And we are not constrained by the intermediate restarts? Only by the balloon availability and M.

          However, we want to maximize the finish time for the task. The best we can do is to pop as many times as we can at the last possible moment? 

          Specifically, we can pop at times: base, base+B_j, base+2*B_j, ... until we run out of balloons or until we exceed M? But note: we cannot pop at time base (which is F_{j-1}+B_j) because then we set the finish time to base+B_j = F_{j-1}+2*B_j. Then we can pop again at time base+B_j (if we have another balloon) to set the finish time to base+2*B_j, and so on.

          Therefore, with k balloons used on task j, we can set the finish time to F_{j-1} + (k+1)*B_j.

          But wait: we must be able to pop at time base + i*B_j for i=0,1,...,k-1? 
              The first pop at base: then the new finish time becomes base+B_j = F_{j-1}+2*B_j. Then we can pop at base+B_j? because that time is <= F_{j-1}+2*B_j? (it is equal) -> so we pop at the deadline. Then the new finish time becomes base+B_j + B_j = F_{j-1}+3*B_j.

          Therefore, we can pop at times: 
                t1 = F_{j-1} + B_j
                t2 = F_{j-1} + 2*B_j
                ...
                tk = F_{j-1} + k*B_j

          And then the finish time becomes F_{j-1} + (k+1)*B_j.

          However, we are constrained by M: we cannot pop at time t if t > M. Therefore, the maximum k we can use is the largest integer such that F_{j-1} + k*B_j <= M.

          Then the finish time becomes min( F_{j-1} + (k+1)*B_j, ... ) but actually we can only pop at multiples as long as they are <= M. So the last pop time is t_k = min(M, F_{j-1} + k*B_j). Then the finish time is min(M, F_{j-1} + k*B_j) + B_j? 

          But note: if we pop at time t_k = F_{j-1}+k*B_j <= M, then the finish time is F_{j-1}+(k+1)*B_j. But if F_{j-1}+k*B_j > M, then we cannot pop at that time. So the last pop time we can achieve is the largest multiple of B_j from F_{j-1} that is <= M. Let k0 = floor((M - F_{j-1}) / B_j). Then the last pop time is F_{j-1} + k0 * B_j, and then the finish time is F_{j-1} + (k0+1)*B_j.

          However, note: we can only use k0 balloons for this task (because we pop at k0 distinct times). 

      Therefore, for task j, the maximum finish time we can force is:
          k0 = floor((M - F_{j-1}) / B_j)   [the number of pops we can do in this task, but note: we are limited by the number of balloons we have for the entire set of tasks, and also for this task we can use at most k0 balloons? Actually, we can use up to k0 balloons for this task, and the finish time becomes F_{j-1} + (k0+1)*B_j.

      But note: if k0 = 0, then we cannot pop at all? Then the finish time is F_{j-1}+B_j.

      However, we might have a balloon that is available at time <= F_{j-1}+B_j? Then we can pop at time F_{j-1}+B_j? which is allowed? Then k0 should be at least 1? 

          Actually, k0 = floor((M - F_{j-1}) / B_j) might be 0 if (M - F_{j-1}) < B_j, but then we can pop at time F_{j-1}+B_j only if F_{j-1}+B_j <= M? But if (M - F_{j-1}) < B_j, then F_{j-1}+B_j > M, so we cannot pop at F_{j-1}+B_j. Therefore, we cannot pop in this task? Then the finish time is F_{j-1}+B_j.

      Therefore, the maximum finish time for task j is:
          If we use k balloons on task j (with k being the maximum number of pops we can do without exceeding M, which is k0 = floor((M - F_{j-1}) / B_j)), then F_j = F_{j-1} + (k+1)*B_j.

      But note: we are not forced to use as many balloons as possible? We only need to make sure that the cumulative time for the first X tasks exceeds M. However, we have a limited number of balloons (X balloons). And we can assign balloons arbitrarily among the tasks.

      Therefore, for fixed X, we want to know: can we assign our X balloons to the first X tasks of Budi (possibly multiple balloons per task) such that the finish time of the last task (the X-th task) is > M?

      How to do that? 

          We want to maximize the finish time of the X-th task. The disruption in one task j is multiplicative: k balloons used in task j cause the task to take (k+1)*B_j minutes. But note: the start time of task j depends on the disruption in the previous tasks.

          Therefore, we want to assign the balloons to the tasks to maximize the overall finish time.

          Since the disruption in a task j adds k*B_j minutes (where k is the number of balloons used on that task) to the natural time (which is B_j), the total time for the first X tasks is: 
                F_X = 0 + (k_1+1)*B_1 + (k_2+1)*B_2 + ... + (k_X+1)*B_X
          but wait: that is if we do not account for the sequential dependency? Actually, no: because the disruption in task 1 delays the start of task 2. 

          Specifically: 
                F_0 = 0.
                F_1 = (k_1+1)*B_1   [if we use k_1 balloons in task 1]
                F_2 = F_1 + (k_2+1)*B_2
                ...
                F_X = F_{X-1} + (k_X+1)*B_X = (k_1+1)*B_1 + (k_2+1)*B_2 + ... + (k_X+1)*B_X.

          This is linear. So the total time is the sum over j of (k_j+1)*B_j.

          And we have the constraint: the number of balloons used in task j (k_j) must be such that we can pop at the times: F_{j-1} + i*B_j for i=1,2,...,k_j and the last pop time (F_{j-1}+k_j*B_j) <= M? 

          Actually, we also have the balloon availability: we can only use a balloon in task j if we have a balloon available at time <= the pop time. And the pop times we use for task j are: F_{j-1} + B_j, F_{j-1} + 2*B_j, ..., F_{j-1} + k_j*B_j.

          The earliest pop time in task j is F_{j-1}+B_j. So we require that we have a balloon available at time <= F_{j-1}+B_j? Actually, no: we might have a balloon available later? But the pop time must be at least the balloon time. Therefore, to pop at time t, we need a balloon available at time <= t.

          Therefore, for the i-th pop in task j (at time F_{j-1}+i*B_j), we require a balloon available at time <= F_{j-1}+i*B_j.

      This becomes very complex.

  Alternative approach:

      We note that the problem has been studied in similar contests. There is a known solution:

          Step 1: Precompute for which X we have S_X = A1+...+A_X <= M.

          Step 2: We want to know if there exists an X (from 1 to N) such that Ayu solves X tasks and we can prevent Budi from solving X tasks. We iterate X from 1 to N.

          Step 3: For a fixed X, we wish to assign the X balloons (available at times S_1, S_2, ... S_X) to cause Budi's X-th task to finish after M. We can assign multiple balloons to the same task. The effect of using k_j balloons in task j is to make the task take (k_j+1)*B_j minutes. And the total time for Budi to finish the first X tasks is F_X = sum_{j=1}^{X} (k_j+1)*B_j.

          We require F_X > M.

          Additionally, we have the constraint: for each task j, and for each balloon used in that task (say at the i-th pop, which is at time F_{j-1}+i*B_j), we must have a balloon available at time <= F_{j-1}+i*B_j.

          But note: F_{j-1} = sum_{i=1}^{j-1} (k_i+1)*B_i.

          Therefore, the constraint for the balloon used for the i-th pop in task j is: 
                There exists a balloon (from the set S_1,...,S_X) that is <= F_{j-1} + i*B_j.

          And we use k_j balloons in task j, so i runs from 1 to k_j.

          We want to assign the balloons to the pops (each pop is identified by a task j and an integer i>=1) such that the balloon time is <= the pop time.

          Since we have exactly X balloons and we have X pops (if we use one balloon per pop) then we can view this as matching.

      However, the problem is: we are free to choose the k_j (nonnegative integers summing to X) and then assign the balloons to the pops.

      We can try to minimize F_X? But we want F_X > M. Actually, we want to know if there is an assignment such that F_X > M.

      How to check for fixed X? 

          Let T = S_1, S_2, ... S_X (sorted increasing).

          We need to assign each balloon to a pop (which is defined by a task j and an index i in 1..k_j). But the pop time is: F_{j-1} + i * B_j, where F_{j-1} = sum_{l=1}^{j-1} (k_l+1)*B_l.

          We can try to greedily assign the balloons to the tasks. However, the value F_{j-1} depends on the k_l for l<j.

      Known solution approach (from similar problems):

          We note that the minimal F_X we can achieve with X balloons is when we use the balloons optimally to minimize the total time? But we want to maximize F_X? Actually, we want to know if we can make F_X > M. So we want to maximize F_X.

          How to maximize F_X? 
              We should use as many balloons as possible on tasks with large B_j. And we should use the balloons in later tasks? because the pop time in a later task is larger (so it can use a balloon that is available later) and also the disruption in a later task has a multiplicative effect on the following tasks.

          Actually, the total time is F_X = sum_{j=1}^{X} (k_j+1)*B_j = (sum_{j=1}^{X} B_j) + (sum_{j=1}^{X} k_j * B_j).

          To maximize F_X, we should assign more balloons to tasks with larger B_j.

          But we also have the constraint: for a balloon used in task j at the i-th pop, we require:
                balloon_time <= F_{j-1} + i * B_j.

          How to assign the balloons to the pops to satisfy the constraints? 

          We can try a greedy algorithm:

              Sort the tasks by B_j (descending) because we want to assign more balloons to larger B_j.

              But note: the value F_{j-1} depends on the previous tasks.

          Alternatively, we can try to simulate the tasks in increasing order of j, but then we are not sure how many balloons to assign to each task.

      Insight:

          We want to know if we can achieve F_X > M. We can try to maximize F_X by using the following:

              Let F = 0.
              Let used_balloons = 0.
              For j from 1 to X:
                  // We are going to assign as many balloons as possible to task j.
                  // But we are constrained by: 
                  //   (1) the total balloons we have: X - used_balloons.
                  //   (2) the constraint for each balloon: the balloon time must be <= F + i * B_j for i=1,2,...,k_j.

                  How many balloons can we assign to task j? 
                      We want to choose k_j (>=0) such that:
                         Condition: There are at least k_j balloons (from the remaining) that are <= F + i * B_j for i=1,2,...,k_j.

                      But note: the condition for the i-th balloon in task j is: the balloon must be <= F + i * B_j.

                  We can try to assign the balloons in increasing order of i: 
                      The first balloon must be <= F + B_j.
                      The second balloon must be <= F + 2*B_j.
                      ...

                  Therefore, we can iterate i starting from 1 until we run out of balloons or until we find an i such that the (used_balloons+i)-th smallest balloon (from the entire set of X balloons) is <= F + i * B_j.

                  However, we have not yet used any balloons, but we are going to assign k_j balloons to task j. We want to know the minimal condition: the i-th balloon we use for task j must be <= F + i * B_j.

                  But note: we can choose which balloons to use. We want to use the balloons that are as small as possible for the small i? 

                  Actually, we should sort the entire set of balloons. Then we can try to assign the smallest available balloon to the first pop in task j, the next smallest to the second pop, etc.

                  Therefore, the condition for the first pop: the smallest available balloon must be <= F + B_j.
                  For the second pop: the second smallest available balloon must be <= F + 2*B_j.
                  ...

                  So the condition for k_j balloons is: the k_j-th smallest available balloon (among the remaining) is <= F + k_j * B_j.

                  How to do this without knowing the entire set? 

          We can pre-sort the balloon array. And then we simulate the tasks j=1 to X. We maintain a pointer to the next available balloon.

          Alternatively, we can use a greedy algorithm that for task j, we find the maximum k_j such that the k_j-th smallest balloon in the entire set (but not yet used) is <= F + k_j * B_j.

          But note: the entire set is fixed. And we are processing tasks in order. And F increases as we go.

          Algorithm for fixed X:

              Sort the balloons: let T[0..X-1] be sorted in increasing order.

              Let F = 0.
              Let ptr = 0 (pointer to the next balloon in T).
              For j from 1 to X:
                  // We consider task j with time B_j.
                  // We wish to assign as many balloons as possible to this task.

                  // We know that after we assign k_j balloons, the finish time becomes F + (k_j+1)*B_j.

                  // How many balloons can we assign to task j?
                  // We need to satisfy: for i=1,2,...,k_j: 
                  //        T[ptr + i - 1] <= F + i * B_j.

                  // We can try k_j from 0 up to min(available_balloons, floor((M - F) / B_j)) ??? But we are not constrained by M in the balloon assignment constraint, but by the balloon times.

                  We can iterate k from 0 upward until we find the largest k such that:
                      T[ptr + k - 1] <= F + k * B_j   [if k>=1]

                  But note: we also have the global constraint that we cannot pop after M: the last pop time is F + k * B_j, which must be <= M? Actually, no: the pop time must be <= M. But if we are only interested in making F_X > M, then we might not care about popping after M? However, the problem states: "Ayu cannot pop any balloon after the M-th minute mark". Therefore, we require that every pop time is <= M.

                  Therefore, for the i-th pop in task j, we require F + i * B_j <= M.

                  But note: we are trying to maximize F_X, and we are free to not use a balloon if it would force a pop time > M. However, we want to use the balloon to maximize the disruption. So we should use the balloon only if the pop time is <= M.

                  Therefore, the maximum number of pops we can do in task j is k0 = min( available_balloons, floor((M - F) / B_j) )? 

                  But then we also have the balloon constraint: we can only use k = min(k0, the largest k such that T[ptr+k-1] <= F + k * B_j).

                  However, we want to use as many as possible to maximize F. 

                  So we set k_j = min( available_balloons, floor((M - F) / B_j), and then we check: 
                      For k = k_j, we require T[ptr + k-1] <= F + k * B_j.

                  But note: it is possible that we cannot use k_j balloons because the k_j-th balloon is too large. Then we reduce k_j until the condition holds? But note: the condition must hold for every i<=k_j. And because T is sorted, the k_j-th balloon is the largest we use. But the condition for i=k_j is the strongest: T[ptr+k_j-1] <= F + k_j * B_j.

                  However, what about the intermediate balloons? 
                      We have: 
                         T[ptr] <= T[ptr+1] <= ... <= T[ptr+k_j-1] <= F + k_j * B_j.
                      But we also require for i=1: T[ptr] <= F+B_j, for i=2: T[ptr+1] <= F+2*B_j, etc.

                  But note: F + k_j * B_j >= F + i * B_j for i<=k_j? No: because k_j>=i -> k_j * B_j >= i * B_j? yes, if B_j>0. So the condition T[ptr+k_j-1] <= F + k_j * B_j implies that for every i<k_j: T[ptr+i-1] <= T[ptr+k_j-1] <= F + k_j * B_j >= F + i * B_j? -> no, F+k_j*B_j is not necessarily >= F+i*B_j for i<k_j? Actually, it is because k_j>=i. 

                  But wait: we require T[ptr+i-1] <= F + i * B_j, and we only have T[ptr+i-1] <= T[ptr+k_j-1] and T[ptr+k_j-1] <= F+k_j*B_j. This does not guarantee T[ptr+i-1] <= F+i*B_j.

                  Example: 
                      F=0, B_j=10, k_j=2.
                      Balloons: [5, 20]
                      Condition for i=1: 5<=0+10 -> 5<=10: holds.
                      Condition for i=2: 20<=0+20 -> 20<=20: holds.
                      But if we try k_j=2, we use both balloons? Then we pop at time 10 and 20. Then the finish time is 20+10=30.

                  But if the balloons were [15,20]? 
                      For i=1: 15<=0+10? -> 15<=10: fails.

                  Therefore, we cannot use even one balloon in this case? 

          So the algorithm per task j:

              Let available_balloons = X - ptr   (the remaining balloons)
              Let k0 = min(available_balloons, floor((M - F) / B_j))   [the maximum number of pops we can do in task j without exceeding M]

              Now, we want to find the maximum k (0<=k<=k0) such that:
                  For every i in [1, k]: T[ptr + i - 1] <= F + i * B_j.

              But note: because the array T[ptr..ptr+k0-1] is sorted, the condition for i=k is the most restrictive? Not necessarily: the balloon times are increasing, and F+i*B_j is increasing. So the condition T[ptr+i-1] <= F+i*B_j must be checked for every i.

              However, we can do a greedy: 
                  k = 0
                  Then try i=1,2,...,k0 until we find one that fails.

              But k0 can be large? We are iterating j from 1 to X, and X up to 100000. And k0 per task might be large? 

              Alternative: we can binary search on k in [0, k0] such that the condition holds for all i in [1,k]. But then how to check the condition? We need to check for i=1..k: T[ptr+i-1] <= F+i*B_j. We can do this in O(k) per task? Worst-case k0 can be 100000, and then over X tasks, it would be O(N^2) -> 10^10.

          We need a more efficient method.

          Observation: 
              The condition is: T[ptr + i - 1] <= F + i * B_j, for i=1,2,...,k.

          We can break as soon as we find an i for which it fails. So we iterate i from 1 to k0, and we stop at the first i such that T[ptr+i-1] > F+i*B_j.

          Then k = i-1.

          But worst-case k0 might be large. However, note that k0 is at most floor((M - F) / B_j). And the total balloons is X. So the sum over j of k0 might be O(X)? 

          Why? Because we are using each balloon at most once. And we have X balloons. Therefore, the total number of pops we do over all tasks is at most X. And k0 is the maximum number of pops we could do in task j (if we had enough balloons) but we only have X. So the sum over j of k0 might be large? 

          But note: floor((M - F) / B_j) could be large, but we break when we use a balloon. And we only have X balloons. So we can break when we have used k0 or when we have used the available_balloons? 

          Actually, we are iterating i from 1 to min(available_balloons, floor((M - F) / B_j)). And we break at the first i that fails the condition. The total number of iterations over all tasks is at most X (since we use each balloon at most once). 

          Therefore, we can do:

              for j from 1 to X:
                 available_balloons = X - ptr
                 k0 = min(available_balloons, (M - F) // B_j)   [integer division, but note: we want the floor]

                 k = 0
                 for i from 1 to k0:
                     if ptr >= X: break   // no more balloons
                     if T[ptr] <= F + i * B_j:
                         // we can use this balloon for the i-th pop in task j
                         ptr++ 
                         k = i   // we have used i balloons in this task
                     else:
                         break

                 Then update F = F + (k+1) * B_j

              End for j.

          Then after processing j=1..X, we have F = F_X.

          And we require F_X > M.

          But note: we might break early if we run out of balloons.

          However, we are using the balloons in increasing order of the balloon time? And we are processing the tasks in order. 

          But is this valid? 

              We are using the smallest available balloon for the first pop in the current task, then the next smallest for the second pop, etc.

          Why is this optimal? 

              We want to assign as many balloons as possible to each task (to maximize F). And for a fixed task j, we want to use as many balloons as possible, and we use the smallest available balloons for the smallest i (to satisfy the condition T[ptr] <= F+i*B_j, because if we use a larger balloon for a small i, it might fail the condition).

          Therefore, the greedy per task j: 
              We consider the next available balloon (the smallest one) and try to use it for the first pop in task j: we require it to be <= F+B_j. 
              Then the next balloon for the second pop: <= F+2*B_j, etc.

          This is valid.

      Step 4: Then we check: 
          For X from 1 to N (that is achievable: S_X<=M) we run the above simulation. 
          If we find an X such that F_X > M, then it is possible for Ayu to win.

      But note: we require Ayu to have strictly more solved tasks than Budi. 
          Ayu solves X tasks.
          Budi solves at most X-1 tasks? Actually, if Budi's finish time for the X-th task is > M, then he hasn't solved the X-th task. So he solved at most X-1 tasks. And since X > X-1, Ayu wins.

      Step 5: We also need to output the plan. But the problem says: output any configuration. We can output the popping times we used in the simulation.

          How to reconstruct the popping times?

              In the simulation, for task j, we used k balloons. The popping times we used are:
                  time1 = F_prev + 1 * B_j   ??? 
                  But wait: our model was: pop at F_prev + i * B_j for i=1,2,...,k.

              But note: we assumed that we pop at multiples of B_j. 

          However, we have the constraint that we can only pop at integer minutes. And these are integers. And they are increasing. 

          Also, we must ensure that the balloon used for the pop at time t is available at time <= t. And we used the balloon T[ptr] (which is <= F_prev + i * B_j) for the i-th pop in task j.

          Therefore, the popping time we assign to that balloon is F_prev + i * B_j.

          But note: we might have multiple options? The problem allows any popping time in [balloon_time, M] as long as it is in the interval (F_prev, F_prev + i * B_j]? Actually, to be in the window of the current restarting task, it must be in (F_prev + (i-1)*B_j, F_prev + i * B_j]? 

          However, we chose to pop at F_prev + i * B_j. And the balloon is available at time T[ptr] <= F_prev + i * B_j. So it is valid.

          Therefore, the entire popping plan is: 
              We have an array of popping times: for each balloon we used, we know the task j and the index i, and the popping time = F_{j-1} + i * B_j.

          But note: we must output the popping times in increasing order. 

          The popping times from task j: 
              F_prev + B_j, F_prev + 2*B_j, ... , F_prev + k*B_j.

          And F_prev = F_0 + (k_1+1)*B_1 + ... + (k_{j-1}+1)*B_{j-1}.

          And the popping times for different tasks: 
              The popping times for task j are in the range [F_prev + B_j, F_prev + k*B_j] and the popping times for task j+1 are in the range [F_prev + (k_j+1)*B_j + B_{j+1}, ...]. 

          Since F_prev + k*B_j <= F_prev + (k_j+1)*B_j (because k_j is the number of balloons we used, and we have k<=k0, but note the natural disruption without exceeding M) and then the next task starts at F_prev + (k_j+1)*B_j, and the next popping time is at least F_prev + (k_j+1)*B_j + B_{j+1} which is > F_prev + k_j * B_j. 

          Therefore, the popping times from different tasks do not overlap. And within a task, they are increasing.

          So if we collect all the popping times (for all tasks) in the order we used the balloons, they are already increasing.

          However, we used the balloons in the order of increasing balloon time? But the popping times might not be in increasing order of the balloon time? 

          Actually, we assigned the smallest balloon to the smallest popping time? Not necessarily: we assigned the smallest balloon to the first pop in the first task? But the popping time in the first task is F0 + B_1 = B_1, and the popping time in the second task is at least F1 + B_2 = (k_1+1)*B_1 + B_2, which is >= B_1. 

          Therefore, the popping times we assign are increasing by the order of tasks. And within a task, they are increasing. 

          But we also have: the balloon times are increasing. However, we might have a balloon with a large time used in an early task (if the popping time for that balloon is available) but our greedy used the smallest balloon first. 

          How to output: 
              We know which balloon (with time s) was used for which popping time t. But the problem does not require that. It only requires a sorted list of popping times.

          Therefore, we can simply output the list of popping times we computed (for every balloon used, the popping time = F_prev + i * B_j for the task j and the i-th pop in that task) in the order of increasing popping time. 

          But note: the popping times we computed are already in increasing order because we process tasks in order and within a task the popping times are increasing, and the next task starts at a time larger than the last popping time of the previous task.

          However, we must ensure that the popping times are at most M? 
              In the simulation, we set k0 = min(available_balloons, (M - F_prev) // B_j). Therefore, the popping times for task j are: F_prev + i*B_j for i=1..k, and F_prev + k*B_j <= M.

          Therefore, all popping times are <= M.

      Step 6: Special case: 
          We must consider that Ayu might not use all balloons? We only use the balloons that we assigned in the simulation. The unused balloons we do not pop? That is allowed.

      Step 7: If we find an X (from 1 to N) such that S_X <= M and after the simulation F_X > M, then we output the plan.

      But note: we must choose the smallest X? Not necessarily: any X. We can iterate X from 1 to N until we find the smallest X for which it is possible? But the problem does not require minimal X, so we can pick any X.

      However, we want to output the configuration. How many balloons we pop? It is the number of balloons we used in the simulation (which is ptr, the pointer in the balloon array).

      But note: we have X balloons available, but we only used ptr (which is the number of balloons we actually used) balloons? 

          Actually, we did:
              Initially: ptr=0.
              For each task j, we did:
                 for i=1 to k0 (but broke early) and we did ptr++ for each balloon we used.

          Then the total number of balloons popped is ptr.

      Then we output:
          First line: K = ptr
          Second line: the list of popping times (which we stored during the simulation) in increasing order.

      But note: the popping times we used are in the order of tasks and pops. And they are increasing.

      Step 8: If no X from 1 to N works, output -1.

  However, note: if Ayu cannot solve any task (X=0), then she has no balloons. Then we need to check: 
        Ayu solves 0 tasks -> then Budi must solve at most -1 tasks? -> which is not possible. 
        Actually, we require Ayu to have strictly more solved tasks than Budi. So if Ayu solves 0, then Budi must solve <0, which is impossible. 

      Therefore, we start X from 1.

  But what if Ayu solves 0 tasks? Then she has 0 balloons. Then we cannot pop any balloon. Then Budi will solve some tasks. We require Ayu to have more solved tasks than Budi: 0 > Y -> Y must be negative -> impossible. So we skip X=0.

  Also, note: we must check that Ayu can solve X tasks: S_X = A1+...+A_X <= M.

  Therefore, the overall algorithm:

      Precompute prefix sums for Ayu: S[0]=0, S[i] = S[i-1] + A_i.

      Let T = [S_1, S_2, ..., S_X] for the balloons? Actually, Ayu gets a balloon at the moment she solves a task. So after solving task i, she gets a balloon at time S_i. Therefore, the balloon times are S_1, S_2, ..., S_X.

      Sort T? But they are already in increasing order (since S_i = S_{i-1}+A_i and A_i>0).

      Then:

          for X in range(1, N+1):
              if S[X] > M:  // Ayu cannot solve X tasks
                  break   // because X is increasing, and S[X] is increasing.

              // Now, we have X balloons: T = [S_1, S_2, ..., S_X] (which is sorted)
              // We want to simulate Budi's first X tasks: 
                  F = 0
                  ptr = 0   // pointer in T (balloons)
                  popping_times = []   // list to record popping times

                  for j in range(1, X+1):   // j from 1 to X
                      // B_j is the time for Budi's j-th task
                      available_balloons = X - ptr
                      if available_balloons == 0:
                          k0 = 0
                      else:
                          // k0 = min(available_balloons, floor((M - F) / B_j))
                          k0 = min(available_balloons, (M - F) // B_j)   [integer division]

                      k = 0
                      for i in range(1, k0+1):
                          // Condition: the next balloon (at T[ptr]) must be <= F + i * B_j
                          if T[ptr] <= F + i * B_j:
                              // Use this balloon: pop at time = F + i * B_j
                              popping_times.append(F + i * B_j)
                              ptr += 1
                              k = i
                          else:
                              break

                      // Update F for task j: 
                      F = F + (k+1)*B_j

                  // After processing the first X tasks of Budi, check:
                  if F > M:
                      // Then Budi did not solve the X-th task? Actually, he did not complete the X-th task? 
                      // He solved at most X-1 tasks? 
                      // Output the plan: 
                          K = len(popping_times)   // which is ptr
                          Output K
                          Output popping_times (which are already in increasing order, because we did tasks in order and pops in increasing i)

                      return

          // If we get here, no X worked:
          Output -1.

  But note: the problem says that Ayu might solve a task at exactly M. Then she gets a balloon at time M. But we cannot pop a balloon after M? So we cannot use that balloon. Therefore, we don't include that balloon? 

      In our balloon set T: we have S_1, S_2, ... S_X. If S_X = M, then the balloon at time M: we can pop at time M? The problem says: "Ayu can pop a balloon as soon as she receives it" and "if Budi solves a task at exactly the M-th minute, then the task is considered as solved, except if Ayu decides to pop a balloon at the same time". And we are allowed to pop at time M.

      Therefore, we can use a balloon at time M? 

      In our simulation: for a pop at time t, we require t<=M. So if we set t=M, that is allowed.

      In the condition: T[ptr] = M, and we require T[ptr] <= F + i * B_j. 
          So M <= F + i * B_j.

      But we also require that we only pop at time F + i * B_j, and we set that time to M? 

      Actually, we set the popping time to F+i*B_j, and we require F+i*B_j <= M? 

      Therefore, if we use a balloon that is available at time M, we must set the popping time to M. Then we require that M <= M, which holds.

      And we also require that the popping time is in the interval (F, F+i*B_j]? Actually, we set it to F+i*B_j, so it must be that F+i*B_j is in the interval? 

          The interval for the pop is (F, F+i*B_j] for the current task? But note: we are at the i-th pop. The current task started at F (after the previous task) and we have set the finish time for the previous pops? 

      Actually, the condition for the pop in the current task is that the pop time must be in (F, F+k*B_j] (for the last pop) and M is in that interval? 

          We have k0 = min(available_balloons, (M-F)//B_j). Then we set the popping time to F+i*B_j for i<=k0, and we know F+i*B_j <= M.

      Therefore, it is valid.

  However, note: in the simulation, we break the inner loop when we run out of balloons or when we cannot assign the next balloon. 

  But what if F + i * B_j is computed as greater than M? We set k0 = min(available_balloons, (M-F)//B_j). Then i runs only to k0, and F+i*B_j <= M.

  Therefore, the algorithm is as above.

  Let's test with sample #1:

      Input: 
          4 30
          9 10 10 10
          4 10 5 10

      Ayu's prefix sums: 
          S1 = 9
          S2 = 19
          S3 = 29
          S4 = 39 -> but 39>30, so Ayu can solve at most 3 tasks.

      We try X=1,2,3.

      X=1: 
          Balloons: [9]
          Budi's tasks: j=1: B1=4
              F=0
              available_balloons=1, k0 = min(1, (30-0)//4) = min(1,7)=1.
              i=1: condition: T[0]=9 <= 0+1*4? 9<=4 -> false.
              So k=0.
              F = 0 + (0+1)*4 = 4.
          Budi's finish time for the first task is 4. He solves 1 task. Ayu solves 1 task -> not strictly greater.

      X=2:
          Balloons: [9, 19]
          Budi: j=1: B1=4 -> as above, k=0, F=4.
          j=2: B2=10
              available_balloons=2
              k0 = min(2, (30-4)//10) = min(2, 26//10)=min(2,2)=2.
              i=1: T[0]=9 <= 4+1*10=14 -> yes -> pop at 4+10=14? but wait: 4+1*10=14 -> pop at 14? 
                     But note: we have two balloons: the first balloon is at 9, which is <=14 -> we use it, popping_time1=14? 
                     Actually, we record popping_times.append(4+1*10=14) -> popping time 14.
                     ptr=1 (now points to 19).
              i=2: T[1]=19 <= 4+2*10=24 -> yes -> pop at 4+2*10=24? -> popping time 24.
                     ptr=2.
              k=2.
              F = 4 + (2+1)*10 = 4+30=34.
          Then F=34>30 -> Budi does not complete the second task? 
          But note: we are simulating the first X=2 tasks. We require that Budi does not complete the 2nd task (since 34>30). Then Ayu solves 2 tasks, Budi solves at most 1 task -> Ayu wins.

          Then we output: 
              K = 2
              popping times: [14, 24]

          However, the sample output is:
                  2
                  12 19

          Why? 

          Let me check the sample explanation:

              Ayu gets first balloon at 9 -> pops at 12. 
              Then Budi was doing the second task (which started at time 4 and would finish at 14) but at 12 he restarts -> new finish time = 12+10=22.
              Then Ayu gets second balloon at 19 -> pops at 19 -> then Budi restarts again: now he started the task at 12, and then at 19 he restarts -> new finish time = 19+10=29.
              Then at 29, Budi finishes the second task? But then he starts the third task? and the contest ends at 30. He doesn't finish the third task. So Budi solved 2 tasks? But Ayu solved 3 tasks? 

          The sample output says Ayu solved 3 tasks, Budi 2.

          Therefore, we must try X=3.

      X=3:
          Balloons: [9, 19, 29]   (since S1=9, S2=19, S3=29)
          Budi: 
            j=1: B1=4 -> k0 = min(3, (30-0)//4)=min(3,7)=3.
                i=1: 9<=0+1*4=4? -> false -> k=0.
                F=4.
            j=2: B2=10 -> k0 = min(3, (30-4)//10)=min(3,2)=2.
                i=1: 9<=4+10=14 -> true -> pop at 4+10=14? -> popping time 14, ptr=1 (balloon at 9 used, next balloon 19)
                i=2: 19<=4+20=24 -> true -> pop at 4+20=24? -> popping time 24, ptr=2 (balloon at 19 used, next balloon 29)
                k=2 -> F = 4 + (2+1)*10 = 34 -> but wait, we haven't done j=3.

          Now j=3: B3=5 -> k0 = min(1, (30-34) -> negative? so k0=0 -> skip.
                F = 34 + (0+1)*5 = 39.

          Then the total time for the first 3 tasks of Budi is 39>30. So Budi does not complete the 3rd task. He only completes the first two? 

          But wait: we disrupted the second task: 
              The pops at 14 and 24: 
                 First pop at 14: then the task restarts at 14 -> finish time becomes 14+10=24? 
                 Then pop at 24: then the task restarts at 24 -> finish time becomes 24+10=34.
              Then the third task starts at 34, and then takes 5 minutes -> 39.

          Therefore, Budi did not complete the third task. But Ayu solved 3 tasks. So we have 3>2.

          Then we output the popping times: [14,24]? 

          But the sample output is [12,19]. 

          Why is [12,19] valid? 
              At time 12: we have a balloon at 9 (which is available at 9) -> we can pop at 12? 
              At time 19: we have a balloon at 19? -> we can pop at 19.

          How does that affect Budi?
              Task1: starts at 0, ends at 4 -> solved.
              Task2: starts at 4. 
                 Pop at 12: then restart at 12 -> new finish time = 12+10=22.
                 Pop at 19: then restart at 19 -> new finish time = 19+10=29.
              Then Budi finishes task2 at 29. 
              Then he starts task3 at 29. The task3 takes 5 minutes -> 34, but the contest ends at 30 -> not solved.

          So Budi solves 2 tasks.

          Therefore, our simulation for X=3 should have found a valid plan? But we did not consider popping at 12 and 19? 

          Why? 

          In our simulation, we are popping at multiples of B_j from the start time of the task. 
            For task2: we popped at 4+10=14 and 4+20=24.

          But we could pop at 12 and 19? 

          How to account for that? 

          The key: the disruption in a task j is not limited to popping at multiples of B_j. We can pop at any integer time as long as it is in the interval (F_{j-1}, F_{j-1}+B_j] for the first pop, and then (t_prev, t_prev+B_j] for the next pop, etc.

          Our method of popping at multiples of B_j is one valid strategy, but there might be others that use the same balloons and yield the same or better disruption.

          However, note: we argued that the maximum disruption for a task j is achieved by popping as many times as possible at multiples of B_j. But in the sample, popping at 12 and 19 causes the finish time to be 29, while popping at 14 and 24 causes the finish time to be 34 -> which is worse. So why didn't we use the worse one? 

          Actually, we want to maximize the disruption to ensure that Budi does not complete the X tasks. In the sample, both 29 and 34 are >30? no, 29<30. 

          Therefore, with our simulation for X=3, we got 39>30 -> valid. But the sample popping [12,19] yields Budi's finish time for the third task at 34? -> 34>30? -> valid too.

          But note: in our simulation, we got 39 for the third task, but the sample only got 34. Why the difference?

          The sample did not disrupt the third task. And our simulation did not disrupt the third task either? 

          In our simulation for X=3, for task3: 
              F_prev = 34, B3=5.
              k0 = min(1, (30-34)//5) = min(1, negative) = 0.
              So we did not pop -> F = 34+5=39.

          But the sample: 
              Budi started the third task at 29, and then without any pop, he would finish at 34. 
              But we did not pop during the third task? So the finish time is 34.

          Why did we get 39? 

          Our model: 
              For task2: we popped twice -> the finish time for task2 = 4 + 3*10 = 34. 
              Then task3 starts at 34 and takes 5 minutes -> 39.

          But the sample popping [12,19] caused the finish time for task2 to be 29, so task3 starts at 29 and takes 5 minutes -> 34.

          Why is our simulation not matching? 

          The issue: our model for the disruption in task j is to add (k_j+1)*B_j minutes. But this is only valid if we pop at multiples of B_j starting from the beginning of the task. However, popping at non-multiples might lead to a different finish time.

          Specifically, the finish time for task j is: last_pop_time + B_j.

          In our simulation, we popped at 14 and 24 for task2: then the last pop time is 24, so the finish time is 24+10=34.

          In the sample, the last pop time is 19, so the finish time is 19+10=29.

          Therefore, we are not limited to popping at multiples. We can pop at any time. And the finish time is last_pop_time + B_j.

          How to maximize the finish time for a task j? 
              We should pop at the latest possible time. The latest possible time we can pop in task j is min(M, F_prev + (k_j)*B_j) ??? 

          Actually, to disrupt the task j, we can only pop at times in [available_balloon_time, min(M, F_prev + B_j, F_prev + 2*B_j, ...)]? 

          But note: we can pop at any time in the interval (F_prev, F_prev + current_time] where current_time is the natural finish time of the current attempt. However, after a pop, the current attempt is reset and the new natural finish time is the pop time + B_j. Then we can pop again in the new interval.

          And the latest we can pop in the last attempt is min(M, last_restart_time + B_j). But last_restart_time is the previous pop time.

          Therefore, to maximize the finish time, we should pop at min(M, last_restart_time + B_j) for the last pop.

          But what if we have multiple balloons? We want to maximize the last pop time. The best is to pop at the very end of each attempt. 

          So the optimal popping schedule for a task j is: 
              Pop at time = min(M, F_prev + B_j) for the first balloon, 
              then if we have a second balloon, pop at time = min(M, min(M, F_prev+B_j) + B_j) = min(M, F_prev+2*B_j),
              and so on.

          Therefore, the finish time for task j is min(M, F_prev + (k_j)*B_j) + B_j? 
              But wait: if we pop at time t1 = min(M, F_prev+B_j), then the new attempt would finish at t1+B_j, but then we pop at t2 = min(M, t1+B_j) = min(M, F_prev+2*B_j), and then the finish time becomes t2+B_j = min(M, F_prev+2*B_j)+B_j.

          However, if F_prev + k_j * B_j <= M, then the last pop time is F_prev + k_j * B_j, and the finish time is F_prev + (k_j+1)*B_j.

          If F_prev + i * B_j > M for some i, then we cannot pop at that multiple. 

          Therefore, our model of the finish time as F_prev + (k_j+1)*B_j is valid only if F_prev + (k_j)*B_j <= M. 
          If F_prev + k_j * B_j > M, then we can only pop at time M for the last pop? 

          But note: we may have popped at several times. The last pop time is the last time we popped, which must be as large as possible: M. Then the finish time is M + B_j.

          But then the finish time is M+B_j, which is > M.

          Therefore, the finish time for task j is: 
              If we use k_j balloons, then the last pop time is t = min(M, F_prev + k_j * B_j)
              Then the finish time is t + B_j.

          And we require that the balloon used for the last pop is available at time <= t.

          But note: the balloons used for the earlier pops must be available at their popping times.

          How to check the condition for the balloons? 
              For the i-th pop in task j, the popping time is t_i = min(M, F_prev + i * B_j) 
              and we require a balloon available at time <= t_i.

          Therefore, we can modify the simulation for task j:

              available_balloons = X - ptr
              k0 = min(available_balloons, floor((M - F_prev) / B_j))  [if we use this, then the popping times are F_prev+i*B_j <= M]

              // But now, if we use k_j balloons, the finish time is F_prev + (k_j+1)*B_j, provided F_prev + k_j * B_j <= M.
              // If F_prev + k_j * B_j > M, then we would set the last pop time to M? 

          However, note: we defined k0 = min(available_balloons, (M-F_prev)//B_j) -> then F_prev + k0 * B_j <= M, and F_prev + (k0+1)*B_j might be > M.

          Then the finish time is F_prev + (k0+1)*B_j.

          So the model is the same.

          Therefore, the finish time for task j is F_prev + (k_j+1)*B_j, and we are not bounded by M in the finish time (we are only bounded by M in the popping time: the last pop time is F_prev+k_j*B_j, which is <= M).

          And then the next task starts at F_prev + (k_j+1)*B_j.

          In the sample for X=3, task2: 
              k0 = min(3, (30-4)//10)=2.
              then we use 2 balloons: then the finish time is 4 + (2+1)*10 = 34.
          Then task3: 
              F_prev=34, B3=5.
              available_balloons=1, k0 = min(1, (30-34)//5)=0.
              then finish time = 34+5=39.

          This is valid because 39>30.

          However, the sample popping [12,19] yields a finish time for task2 of 29, and then task3 of 34 (which is also >30) and uses only 2 balloons.

          Why didn't we get a solution with fewer balloons or earlier? 

          The issue is: we are not required to minimize the number of balloons. We can output any valid plan.

          But the sample output for the same input is [12,19] for X=3.

          Why didn't we try X=3 and then not use the multiples strategy? 

          The problem is that our simulation popping at multiples might use more balloons than necessary, but it is a valid plan. The sample output is also valid.

          The problem says: output any configuration.

          Therefore, we can output our plan: [14,24] for X=3.

          However, the sample expected [12,19] for X=3? 

          But the sample output says:
              2
              12 19

          and not 3 balloons? 

          Why only 2 balloons? 

          In the sample output, Ayu solved 3 tasks, so she has 3 balloons. But she only popped 2 balloons. 

          In our simulation for X=3, we used 2 balloons in task2 and none in task3. That is 2 balloons.

          Therefore, we would output:
              K = 2
              popping times = [14,24]

          But the sample output is [12,19].

          Why is [12,19] better? It is not, but the problem allows any valid plan.

          However, the sample input/output #1 says output is "2" and "12 19".

          How can we generate 12 and 19? 

          We must allow popping at any integer time, not necessarily multiples of B_j.

          How to change our simulation to allow popping at any integer time? 

          We want to maximize the finish time for Budi's tasks. The best is to pop as late as possible in each task. 

          For a task j, the latest we can pop with a balloon available at time s is min(M, s + ? ) 

          Actually, to disrupt the task j, the first pop can be at any time in [max(s, F_prev+1), min(M, F_prev+B_j)].
          Then after popping at time t1, the next pop can be at any time in [max(s_next, t1+1), min(M, t1+B_j)].

          To maximize the finish time, we would set the last pop time to be as late as possible: min(M, last_restart_time + B_j - 1) ? 

          But note: the finish time is last_pop_time + B_j. To maximize the finish time, we should maximize last_pop_time.

          The maximum last_pop_time we can achieve in task j with a set of balloons is: min(M, F_prev + (k_j)*B_j) [by popping at the very end of each segment] as before.

          Therefore, the multiples strategy is optimal for maximizing the finish time of the task.

          So we are not missing any better disruption.

          Then why does the sample use 12 and 19? 
              With 12 and 19, the finish time for task2 is 29, which is < 34. 

          But 29 is not >30, so it does not prevent Budi from completing the task2? 

          Actually, the contest ends at 30, and 29<=30, so Budi completes the task2.

          Therefore, the sample explanation says that at minute 29, Budi solved the second task. 

          But then he has not solved the third task. 

          Our simulation for X=3 requires that we prevent Budi from completing 3 tasks. In the sample, by popping at 12 and 19, they made sure that Budi completes task2 at 29 and then cannot complete task3 (which takes 5 minutes, so 34>30). 

          Our simulation for X=3 got a finish time for task2 of 34, which is >30, so task2 is not completed? 

          But then Budi only completes task1, and Ayu completes 3 tasks. 

          Both are valid.

          However, the problem: 
              We require that Ayu has strictly more solved tasks than Budi. 
                  In the sample plan: Ayu has 3, Budi has 2 -> valid.
                  In our simulation plan for X=3: Ayu has 3, Budi has 1 (because task2 is not finished) -> also valid.

          Therefore, we have a valid plan for X=3.

          The sample output happens to be for X=3, but they outputted the popping times in a different way. 

      Conclusion: our simulation with popping at multiples of B_j is valid. We output the popping times as the multiples.

      Let's run the provided examples:

      Sample Input #2: 
          "5 50
          10 10 10 10 10
          15 12 19 17 20"

          Ayu: 
              S1=10, S2=20, S3=30, S4=40, S5=50.
          For X=5: S5=50<=50 -> we try.

          Budi's tasks: 
              j1: B1=15 -> 
                  available_balloons=5, k0 = min(5, (50-0)//15)= min(5,3)=3.
                  i=1: T[0]=10<=0+15=15 -> use balloon, popping at 15, ptr=1.
                  i=2: T[1]=20<=0+30=30 -> use balloon, popping at 30, ptr=2.
                  i=3: T[2]=30<=0+45=45 -> use balloon, popping at 45, ptr=3.
                  k=3, F=0+(3+1)*15=60 -> already >50 -> then we don't need to do the remaining tasks? 

          But note: we are processing tasks in order. We only care that the cumulative time for the first 5 tasks exceeds 50. 
              After task1: F=60>50, then Budi will not do the next tasks? 

          Actually, the problem: Budi does the tasks in order. He hasn't started task2 because task1 didn't finish by 50.

          Therefore, we have prevented him from completing the first task? -> no, he hasn't completed the first task? 

          How many tasks has Budi completed? 
              He completes a task only if he finishes by time M, and only if there is no pop at the exact finish time.
          In our simulation, the finish time for task1 is 60>50, so he did not complete task1.

          Therefore, he completed 0 tasks.

          Then Ayu completed 5 tasks > 0 -> valid.

          But the sample output is "0", meaning no balloons popped.

          Why? 

          Let me compute without any pops:
              Ayu: 10,20,30,40,50 -> 5 tasks.
              Budi: 
                  task1: 0+15=15 (solved)
                  task2: 15+12=27 (solved)
                  task3: 27+19=46 (solved)
                  task4: 46+17=63>50 -> not solved.
                  task5: not started.
              So Budi solved 3 tasks, and Ayu solved 5>3 -> valid.

          Therefore, we don't need to pop any balloon.

          In our simulation for X=5, we try to prevent Budi from solving 5 tasks. But without any pops, he already solves only 3 tasks. So we don't need to pop any balloon.

          How to account for that? 

          In the simulation for a given X, we want to know: can we make sure that Budi solves at most X-1 tasks? 
             If we can do it without popping any balloon, then F_X (the cumulative time for Budi to finish the first X tasks) might be computed as the natural time.

          In the natural time for the first X tasks: 
              F_X = B1+B2+...+B_X.

          If F_X > M, then even without any pops, Budi does not complete the X-th task. 

          Therefore, we can do:

              for X in 1..N:
                  if S_X <= M: 
                      F = 0
                      for j in 1..X:
                          F = F + B_j   // natural time for the task
                          // But if we use pops, we can make it larger. 
                      // But if F > M, then we don't need any pops: output 0 pops.

          However, note: if F > M, then Budi does not complete the X-th task. But we don't need to use any pops.

          Therefore, we can first try without any pops: if the natural time for the first X tasks is > M, then we output 0 pops.

          Or we can run the simulation with popping, but it will use 0 pops if the natural time is >M? 

          How? 
              In the simulation for task j, we have:
                  k0 = min(available_balloons, (M - F_prev) // B_j)
              If the natural time for the task is F_prev + B_j > M, then (M - F_prev) // B_j = 0 (or negative) -> k0=0, then we use 0 pops, and then F = F_prev + B_j > M.

          But then the next tasks are not simulated? 

          Actually, we break the condition for the next tasks? We still simulate all tasks, but for a task j, if F_prev > M, then (M-F_prev) is negative -> k0=0.

          But note: the finish time for a task is F_prev + (k_j+1)*B_j. If F_prev > M, then this is even larger.

          Therefore, we can break early: once F_prev > M, then the remaining tasks will not be completed anyway.

          But the problem is: we are simulating the first X tasks. We only care that F_X > M.

          So we can break the inner loop (over j) if F_prev > M.

          In sample #2 for X=5: 
              natural time for the first 5 tasks = 15+12+19+17+20 = 83>50. 
              Therefore, without any pops, F=83>50 -> valid.

          Then we output 0 pops.

          Therefore, we must change the simulation: 

              We can first try: 
                  F = 0
                  for j=1 to X:
                      // If we use no pops for this task, then the time for the task is B_j, and we want to know if we can use pops to make it larger? But we don't have to.
                      // We are not forced to use pops. We only use pops if we want to and if it helps.

              But our simulation already allows using 0 pops if the condition for the balloons fails or if k0=0.

          Therefore, the simulation will work for sample#2: 
              X=5: 
                  j1: B1=15, k0 = min(5, (50-0)//15)=3, then we can use 3 balloons? 
                  But we don't have to. We can use 0 balloons. 
                  However, we are not trying to minimize the number of pops. We are using a greedy that uses as many as possible to maximize the disruption.

                  But the problem: we only care that the cumulative time >50. If we can achieve it without using any pops, then we can use 0 pops.

                  In our simulation: we are popping only if it is possible and if the balloon condition holds. But if we don't pop, then for task1: F = 0+15 = 15.
                  Then for task2: F_prev=15, B2=12, k0 = min(5, (50-15)//12)=min(5,2)=2.
                      i=1: T[0]=10<=15+12=27 -> true -> pop at 15+12=27? -> then F = 15 + (1+1)*12 = 15+24=39.
                  task3: F_prev=39, B3=19, k0 = min(3, (50-39)//19)=min(3,0)=0 -> then F=39+19=58>50 -> then we break.

                  Then we output 1 balloon? popping time=[27]

                  But the sample output is 0.

          Why use a pop if we don't need to? 

          We want to know: is there a way to have Ayu win. We found a way with 1 pop. But there is a way with 0 pops.

          We are iterating X. We first try X=1, then X=2, then X=3, then X=4, then X=5.

          For X=5: we require that the cumulative time for Budi's first 5 tasks exceeds 50. 
              Without any pops: 
                  F1 = 15, F2=15+12=27, F3=27+19=46, F4=46+17=63>50.
                  So after 4 tasks, the cumulative time 63>50. 
                  Therefore, we don't need to pop. We can win by X=5 with 0 pops.

          How to check this in the simulation? 

          We can compute the natural time on the fly. But our simulation with popping might use pops and yield F>50 earlier, but that is also valid.

          However, we want to output the minimal number of balloons popped? The problem does not require that.

          But the sample output for sample#2 is 0.

          Therefore, we must not use any pops if not necessary.

          We can change the simulation: 
              In the task j, we do not need to use any pops if even without any pops the cumulative time will eventually exceed M.

              But note: the natural time for the first X tasks might be > M. In that case, we can use 0 pops.

          How to check that quickly? 
              Precompute the prefix sums for Budi: 
                  Let U[0]=0, U[j]=U[j-1]+B_j.

              Then for X, if U[X] > M, then we win with 0 pops.

          Therefore, we can do:

              for X in 1..N:
                  if S_X (Ayu's prefix) > M: break.
                  if U_X (Budi's prefix) > M: 
                      // then we output 0 pops for this X.
                      K=0, and no popping times.
                      output and return.

              // If not, then we run the popping simulation.

          But wait: even if U_X <= M, we might use pops to make the cumulative time >M.

          Therefore, the algorithm for fixed X:

              if U_X > M: 
                  // no pops needed
                  output for this X: K=0, and we return.

              else:
                  // run the popping simulation as before.

          In sample#2, for X=5: U_5 = 15+12+19+17+20 = 83>50 -> then we output 0 pops.

          In sample#1, for X=3: U_3 = 4+10+5 = 19<=30 -> then we run the popping simulation.

          Then we get a plan with 2 pops.

          In sample#3: 
              "5 10
              15 10 5 5 5
              9 10 10 10 10"

              Ayu: S1=15>10 -> cannot even solve the first task.
              So we break at X=1: no valid X.

              Output -1.

          Therefore, the final algorithm:

              Precompute:
                  S[0]=0, U[0]=0
                  for i in 1..N:
                      S[i] = S[i-1] + A_i
                      U[i] = U[i-1] + B_i

              for X in range(1, N+1):
                  if S[X] > M: 
                      break   // no more valid X

                  // Check if with 0 pops we have U[X] > M: 
                  if U[X] > M:
                      // Then output for this X: 0 pops.
                      print(0)
                      return

                  // Otherwise, we simulate Budi's first X tasks with popping:

                      F = 0
                      ptr = 0
                      popping_times = []

                      for j in range(1, X+1):
                          // If F > M, we can break early (but we still need to output, so we break the inner loop)
                          if F > M:
                              // This task and beyond are not completed? But we only care about the first X tasks, and we already have F>M.
                              // We break the inner loop.
                              break

                          available_balloons = X - ptr
                          if available_balloons == 0:
                              k0 = 0
                          else:
                              // k0 = min(available_balloons, (M - F) // B_j)
                              k0 = min(available_balloons, (M - F) // B_j)

                          k = 0
                          for i in range(1, k0+1):
                              // Check the condition for the balloon at T[ptr] (which is S[ptr]? 
                                  // But note: our balloon array T is the first X prefix sums of A: T = [S1, S2, ..., S_X] 
                                  // and they are sorted in increasing order.
                              if T[ptr] <= F + i * B_j:
                                  popping_times.append( F + i * B_j )
                                  ptr += 1
                                  k = i
                              else:
                                  break

                          F = F + (k+1)*B_j

                      if F > M:
                          // output the plan for this X
                          print( len(popping_times) )
                          print( " ".join( map(str, popping_times) ) 
                          return

              // if no X works
              print(-1)

  Let's test sample#1 for X=3:

      T = [9, 19, 29]

      j=1: B1=4
          F=0, available_balloons=3, k0 = min(3, 30//4)=min(3,7)=3.
          i=1: T[0]=9<=0+4? 9<=4 -> false -> k=0.
          F=0+ (0+1)*4 = 4.

      j=2: B2=10
          F=4, available_balloons=3, k0=min(3, (30-4)//10)=min(3,2)=2.
          i=1: T[0]=9<=4+10=14 -> true -> pop at 4+10=14, ptr=1, popping_times=[14], k=1.
          i=2: T[1]=19<=4+20=24 -> true -> pop at 4+20=24, ptr=2, popping_times=[14,24], k=2.
          F=4+ (2+1)*10 = 34.

      j=3: B3=5
          F=34, available_balloons=1, k0 = min(1, (30-34)//5)=0.
          F=34+ (0+1)*5 = 39>30 -> valid.

      Then we output:
          K=2
          popping_times = [14,24]

      But the sample output is 2 and [12,19]. 

      However, the problem allows any valid plan. We can output [14,24].

  Note: we might also break after j=2: because F=34>30, then we skip j=3. But then we still output [14,24] and it's valid.

  Therefore, we can break the inner loop if F>M.

  But note: we must simulate all tasks? because the popping in task j might be limited by the condition, and then the next task might be the one that pushes F>M. However, if F>M already, then Budi will not complete the current task, and we only care about the first X tasks.

  So we can break.

  Complexity: 
      The outer loop X from 1 to N (at most 100000). The inner loop over j from 1 to X, and within j, the i loop has total iterations over all j bounded by X (the total number of balloons used). 
      Therefore, the total complexity is O(N).

  Let's run sample#2 with X=5:

      We first check: U[5]=15+12+19+17+20=83>50 -> then we output 0 pops.

  Sample#3: 
      X=1: S[1]=15>10 -> break. Then output -1.

  Therefore, we are done.

  Note: We must be careful about the balloon array T: for X, T = the first X prefix sums of A. But we are iterating X from 1 to N. We can precompute the prefix sums for A and store in an array, and then for each X, we use the first X elements.

  However, we can do the entire simulation in one pass for increasing X? 

      We iterate X from 1 to N, and we break when S[X]>M.

      For each X, we do:

          // Check U[X] > M? -> then output 0 pops and return.

          // Then simulate the X-th task for Budi? 
          But note: the simulation for X is for the first X tasks of Budi. And we are increasing X. The simulation for X reuses the previous state? 

      We want to avoid recomputing from scratch for every X.

      How to reuse? 

          We maintain:
              F: the cumulative time for Budi after the first j-1 tasks (for j from 1 to X) 
              ptr: the number of balloons used so far.
              popping_times: the list of popping times.

          But when we go to X+1, we have an extra balloon (at time S[X]) and an extra task for Budi.

          However, the popping_times and F for the first X tasks are computed and then we add task X+1.

          But the condition for the balloons in task j might change if we have more balloons? 

          Actually, in the simulation for a fixed X, we only use the balloons available in the first X. 

          Therefore, we must do for each X independently.

      But note: the total work over all X might be O(N^2). 

      How to make it O(N)? 

          We note that the total number of balloons used over all X is at most the total number of balloons (which is the number of tasks we consider, at most N). And the inner i-loop (over the pops in a task) total iterations is the total number of balloons used.

          Therefore, we can do:

              F = 0
              ptr = 0
              popping_times = []

              for X in range(1, N+1):
                  if S[X] > M: break

                  // Add the new balloon: we now have a balloon at time S[X]. But we haven't used it yet.

                  // Check if without any additional pops, the natural time for the first X tasks (which we don't have) -> we have to account for the disruption we already did.

                  // Actually, we are not recomputing from scratch. We are in the middle of the simulation: we have already done the first X-1 tasks.

                  // We are at state: F = cumulative time for Budi after the first X-1 tasks.
                  // And we have used 'ptr' balloons.

                  // Now we add task X.

                  // But we also have an extra balloon at time S[X].

                  However, we have not included this balloon in the sorted array T? 

                  Our balloon array for the entire simulation up to X is T[0..X-1] = [S1, S2, ... S_X]. 

                  But we are processing X sequentially. We can keep the array T as we go? 

                  Actually, we can keep the balloon times in a min-heap? But our algorithm uses the smallest balloon first.

                  We need to insert the new balloon at time S[X] and then have the entire set sorted? 

                  But we are using a greedy that requires the balloons in increasing order.

          We can change the simulation to use a priority queue (min-heap) for the available balloons.

          However, in the condition for task j: we require for the i-th pop: a balloon <= F + i * B_j. 

          We can do:

              Use a min-heap for the available balloons.
              For task j (which is the next task), we wish to use as many balloons as possible.

                  i=1: we need a balloon <= F + B_j. 
                      We can get the smallest balloon. If it is <= F+B_j, then we use it. Then we remove it and record the popping time = F+i*B_j = F+B_j.

                  i=2: we need a balloon <= F+2*B_j. 
                      We get the next smallest balloon. 

          But note: we might have a balloon that is larger than F+B_j but <= F+2*B_j, and we didn't use it for i=1 because it was too large. Now it is available.

          Therefore, we can do:

              while we have available balloons and we can do more pops (i<=k0) and the smallest available balloon is <= F + i * B_j:
                  then use it for the i-th pop.

          But how many i? i goes from 1 to k0. We can do:

              i=1
              while i<=k0 and heap not empty:
                  pop the smallest balloon: s = heapq.heappop(heap)
                  if s <= F + i * B_j:
                      popping_times.append( F + i * B_j )
                      i += 1
                  else:
                      // we cannot use this balloon for the i-th pop? 
                      // But we might use it for a larger i? 
                      // However, F+i*B_j is increasing. 
                      // Actually, we can put it back and break? 
                      // But we might have a balloon that is even larger? 
                      // Since the heap is a min-heap, the smallest balloon is the smallest. If it fails, then all fail.
                      break

              Then the number of pops in this task is k = i-1.

          But note: we might have a balloon that fails for i, but might work for a larger i? 

              Example: 
                  F=0, B_j=10, 
                  balloons: [15, 20]
                  k0 = min(2, (M-0)//10) = 2.
                  i=1: smallest balloon=15<=0+10? -> 15<=10? false.
                  Then we break. But we could use 15 for i=2: 15<=0+20=20 -> true.

          Therefore, we cannot break. We must try the next balloon for the same i? 

          But note: if the smallest balloon is too large for i, then we cannot use it for i, but we might use it for a larger i? 

          How about: 
              We iterate i from 1 to k0, and for each i, we find a balloon that is <= F+i*B_j. 
              But we want to use as many balloons as possible.

          We can do:

              i=1
              while i<=k0 and the heap is not empty:
                  s = min_balloon
                  if s <= F+i*B_j:
                      use it for the i-th pop: popping at F+i*B_j.
                      pop the balloon, and i++.
                  else:
                      // skip this balloon? but it might be used for a larger i? 
                      // But there might be a smaller balloon that we haven't seen? 
                      // Actually, we have the min-heap, so this is the smallest. It is the only candidate for the current i.
                      // So we cannot use any balloon for the current i? then i++? 

                  This won't work.

          Alternatively, we can try to assign the balloons in increasing order to the pops in increasing i. 

          The condition for pop i is s <= F+i*B_j.

          We can try for i from 1 to k0, and for each i, we want any balloon that is <= F+i*B_j.

          Since the balloons are not assigned, we can choose arbitrarily. We want to use as many as possible.

          We can do:

              Consider the set of available balloons. We want to assign as many as possible to the pops i=1..k0, with the condition that the balloon assigned to pop i must be <= F+i*B_j.

          This is a greedy matching: 
              Sort the balloons (we have a min-heap, so we get them in increasing order).
              Sort the pop conditions (F+i*B_j for i=1..k0) in increasing order.

              Then for i=1 to k0, we check if the smallest balloon is <= F+i*B_j.

          But note: the pop conditions are increasing (since i*B_j is increasing). 

          Therefore, we can do:

              for i in range(1, k0+1):
                 condition_i = F + i * B_j
                 while heap is not empty and min_balloon <= condition_i:
                     // then we can use this balloon for pop i (or for a pop i'>=i) 
                     // But we want to use it for the smallest i it can be used? to allow the larger balloons for larger i? 
                     // Actually, we are at condition_i, and we have a balloon that is <= condition_i. We can assign it to pop i.
                     popping_times.append(condition_i)
                     heapq.heappop(heap)
                     i_count += 1   // we have used one balloon
                     break   // and then we move to i+1? 

                 But if we break, we move to i+1. But if we didn't find a balloon for pop i, we move to i+1? 

              But note: it is possible that we don't have a balloon for pop i, but we might have one for a larger i? 

              We don't break the i loop. We do:

                 i=1
                 while i<=k0 and the heap is not empty:
                    condition_i = F+i*B_j
                    s = heapq[0]   // smallest balloon
                    if s <= condition_i:
                         popping_times.append(condition_i)
                         heapq.heappop(heap)
                         i += 1
                    else:
                         i += 1   // skip this i

          Why skip i? 

          Example: 
              F=0, B_j=10, k0=2.
              Balloons: [25]
              i=1: 25<=0+10? no -> skip i=1 -> i=2: 25<=0+20? no -> skip i=2.

          But then we use 0 balloons.

          However, we might have a balloon that is 25, and we can use it for pop i=3? but k0=2.

          Therefore, we only consider i up to k0.

          Then the number of pops in the task is the number of balloons we used.

          Then we update: 
              F = F + (k+1)*B_j   // where k = number of balloons used in the task.

          But note: the popping times we used are for i= some indices, but not necessarily contiguous starting from 1? 

          However, the finish time is last_pop_time + B_j, and the last_pop_time is the largest popping time we used. But we used the conditions for i: F+i*B_j. And we used them in increasing i. So the largest i we used is the last one.

          But if we skipped some i, then the last_pop_time is not the last i? 

          Actually, we are not popping at multiples of B_j in sequence? 

          Specifically, if we use a balloon for pop i, then the popping time is F+i*B_j. This has the effect of restarting the task at time F+i*B_j, and then the new projected finish time is F+i*B_j + B_j.

          But then if we use another balloon for a larger i (say i'>i), then the new popping time is F+i'*B_j, which must be in the interval (F+i*B_j, F+i*B_j+B_j]? 
              F+i'*B_j should be > F+i*B_j (since i'>i) and <= F+i*B_j+B_j? 
                  -> i'*B_j - i*B_j <= B_j -> (i'-i) <= 1 -> i'=i+1.

          Therefore, we can only use contiguous i starting at 1. 

          Why? 
              After popping at i, the next pop must be in the interval (F+i*B_j, F+i*B_j+B_j] = (F+i*B_j, F+(i+1)*B_j]. 
              The next condition is for i'=i+1: popping at F+(i+1)*B_j, which is at the endpoint. That is allowed.

          But if we skip i, then for i+1, the condition is F+(i+1)*B_j, which is outside the current attempt? 

          Therefore, the only way to use a balloon for pop i+1 is if we have already used a balloon for pop i.

          So the i must be assigned in increasing order and contiguous.

          Therefore, we cannot skip an i. 

          This means: if we cannot find a balloon for pop i, then we cannot use any balloon for pop i' > i.

          Therefore, the greedy per task j should be:

              i=1
              while i<=k0 and the heap is not empty and the smallest balloon in the heap <= F+i*B_j:
                  use it for pop i.
                  heapq.heappop(heap)
                  popping_times.append(F+i*B_j)
                  i += 1

              k = i-1

          Then update F = F + (k+1)*B_j.

          This is the same as our first simulation, but with a heap that has the new balloon added for each X. 

          How to incrementally add balloons? 

              We start with an empty heap.
              for X in 1..N:
                  if S[X] > M: break
                  // Add the new balloon at time S[X] to the heap.

                  if U[X] > M: then output 0 and return.

                  // Then for the X-th task (which is the next task for Budi, index j=X), 
                  //   but note: we have simulated tasks 1..X-1 already? 

                  We are not. We have to simulate tasks 1..X for Budi in order. But we are at the state after X-1 tasks.

              We need to change: we simulate tasks in order from 1 to X, but we add balloons as we solve tasks (so at task j, the balloons available are the ones from tasks 1..j).

          But the prefix sums for Ayu: the balloon for task j is available at time S_j, and we solve task j at time S_j.

          In Budi's task j, we start at time F_{j-1}. We need to have the balloon available at time <= F_{j-1} + i * B_j.

          But if we are to use the balloon from task j (available at time S_j) in task j, then we require S_j <= F_{j-1} + i * B_j.

          This might not hold if F_{j-1} + i * B_j < S_j.

          Therefore, we must simulate the tasks in increasing j, and for each task j, we add the balloon at time S_j to the heap at the start of the task.

          Algorithm:

              F = 0
              heap = []   // min-heap for available balloon times
              popping_times = []

              for X in 1..N:   // X is the number of tasks of Ayu, and also the task index for Budi
                  if S[X] > M: break   // Ayu cannot solve X tasks

                  // Ayu solved task X: add a balloon at time S[X]
                  heapq.heappush(heap, S[X])

                  // Check natural cumulative time for Budi's first X tasks: we are not using the natural time, we use disrupted time.

                  // But we cannot check U[X] because the disruption changes the cumulative time.

                  // Instead, we simulate task X for Budi:

                      available_balloons = len(heap)
                      k0 = min(available_balloons, (M - F) // B[X])   // B[X] is the time for Budi's X-th task

                      i = 1
                      while i<=k0 and heap and heap[0] <= F + i * B[X]:
                          // use the smallest balloon for the i-th pop in task X
                          s = heapq.heappop(heap)
                          popping_times.append( F + i * B[X] )
                          i += 1

                      k = i-1
                      F = F + (k+1)*B[X]

                  // Then after task X, if F > M:
                      // then we output for this X: 
                      print( len(popping_times) )
                      print( sorted(popping_times) )   // but are they sorted? 
                             // We added them in increasing order by task and by i. They are in increasing order.
                      return

              // then if we never find one, output -1.

          But note: we might not use any pops and then F = F + B[X] might be <= M, and then we move to the next X.

          And we have a new balloon for the next X.

          In sample#1 for X=1:

              Balloon: push(9)
              F=0, B[1]=4, k0 = min(1, 30//4)=1.
              i=1: heap[0]=9 <= 0+1*4=4? -> 9<=4 -> false -> k=0.
              F=0+(0+1)*4=4.

          X=2:
              push(19)  -> heap = [9,19] (min-heap, so [9,19])
              F=4, B[2]=10, k0=min(2, (30-4)//10)=2.
              i=1: heap[0]=9<=4+10=14 -> true: 
                    pop the 9, add popping time 4+10=14.
                    i=2
              i=2: heap[0]=19<=4+20=24 -> true:
                    pop the 19, add popping time 24.
                    i=3 -> break since i>k0 (2)
              k=2, F=4+3*10=34.

          Then after X=2: F=34>30? no, we go to X=3.

          X=3:
              push(29) -> heap = [29]  (min-heap)
              F=34, B[3]=5, k0 = min(1, (30-34)//5)=0.
              F=34+ (0+1)*5 = 39>30 -> then we output.

          popping_times = [14,24]

          This is the same as before.

          In sample#2 for X=1..5:

              We do:

                  X=1: balloon = 10
                      F=0, B[1]=15, k0=min(1,50//15)=1.
                      i=1: heap[0]=10<=0+15=15 -> true.
                          popping_times.append(15), heap becomes empty.
                          F=0+2*15=30.

                  X=2: balloon=20
                      heap=[20]
                      F=30, B[2]=12, k0=min(1, (50-30)//12)=1.
                      i=1: heap[0]=20<=30+12=42 -> true.
                          pop, add popping time 30+12=42.
                          F=30+2*12=54.
                  X=3: balloon=30, 
                      heap=[30]
                      F=54>50 -> break the inner simulation? 
                  Then after X=3, we have F=54>50, and we output the popping_times = [15,42] (which is 2 balloons).

          But we could have won at X=5 with 0 balloons? 

          We never check the condition U[X]>M. 

          How to integrate that? 

          We can check at the start of each X: after we add the balloon, and before we disrupt task X, the natural time for the first X tasks (which is not the same as our F) might be > M. 

          But our F is the disrupted time. The natural time is not available.

          Alternatively, we can also try to output 0 balloons if at any X the cumulative disrupted time (or even the natural time) is > M? 

          But note: we require to prevent only the X-th task from being completed. We don't require the first X-1 tasks to be uncompleted.

          We can win at an earlier X? 

          In sample#2, after X=1, if we use one balloon, then F=30>50? no. 

          After X=2, F=54>50 -> then we output.

          But note: at X=2, Ayu solved 2 tasks, and Budi solved at most 1 task (because the finish time for the second task is 54>50 -> not completed) -> valid.

          However, the sample output is 0 balloons. That is for X=5.

          How to get the minimal number of balloons? 

          The problem does not require minimal balloons, so we can output the first X that works.

          But the sample output for sample#2 is 0 balloons. 

          We can iterate X from 1 to N and choose the smallest X that works? 

          Why not? 

          But note: a smaller X might require fewer balloons? 

          We want to win: Ayu solves X tasks and Budi solves at most X-1 tasks.

          We should try the smallest X possible? 

          Example: 
              If X=1 works, then we output a plan for X=1.

          In sample#2, can we win at X=1? 
              Ayu solves 1 task -> balloon at 10.
              Budi's first task: without any pop, he would finish at 15<=50 -> he completes it. So Budi solves 1 task -> not strictly more.
              With pops: we use one balloon: popped at 0+15=15? 
                 then the finish time = 15+15=30.
                 then he completes the first task at 30<=50 -> still completed.
              But then we can try more pops? but we only have one balloon.

          Actually, with one balloon, the finish time is 30, so he completes the task. 

          Therefore, X=1 does not work.

          X=2: 
              Ayu solves 2 tasks: balloons at 10,20.
              Without any pops: 
                 Budi: task1:15, task2:15+12=27 -> completed both -> Ayu:2, Budi:2 -> not strictly more.
              With pops: 
                 We can use up to 2 balloons.
                 We want to prevent Budi from completing the second task? -> make the finish time of the second task >50.
                 But the natural time is 27. We need to make it at least 51.

                 With one balloon in the second task: 
                    pop at time = min(50, 15+12)=27? then the finish time=27+12=39.
                 With two balloons in the second task:
                    pop at 15+12=27, then again at 27+12=39, then finish at 39+12=51>50 -> valid.

                 Then we output 2 balloons: popping at 27 and 39.

              But we also have a balloon from the first task: can we use one in the first task and one in the second?
                 In the first task: pop at 15 -> finish time=30.
                 Then second task: 
                    start at 30, then we can pop at 30+12=42 -> then finish at 42+12=54>50 -> valid.
                    and we use 2 balloons.

          Therefore, we can win at X=2.

          But the sample output is 0 for X=5.

          The problem: output any configuration. We can output the one for X=2.

          Therefore, we should try for increasing X, and as soon as we find an X for which we win, we output the plan and return.

          In sample#2, we would win at X=2 with 2 balloons.

          But the sample output is 0 for X=5. Why is that valid? 
              It is valid, but not the only valid solution.

          The problem sample output #2 is "0", so we must output 0 for that instance.

          How to achieve that? 
              We check: can we win with 0 balloons at any X? 
                 This happens if the natural time for the first X tasks (without any pops) is > M.

          But in sample#2, the natural time for the first 5 tasks is 83>50, so we win at X=5 with 0 balloons.

          We encounter X=5 after X=2.

          Therefore, we should try to win without any pops as early as possible? 

          How about: 
              For each X, before we even consider using pops, we check: 
                  if the cumulative time for the first X tasks of Budi (without any pops) is > M, then we win with 0 balloons.

          But note: we have disrupted the first X-1 tasks, so the start time for task X might be delayed. The natural time for the first X tasks in Budi is not just U[X] but our F + B_X (if we don't pop in task X).

          And F is the disrupted time for the first X-1 tasks.

          Therefore, we cannot compute it without the disruption.

          Alternatively, we can win with 0 balloons in the entire contest if at some X, the cumulative disrupted time for the first X tasks (even if we don't pop in task X) is > M. 
              That is, if F + B_X > M.

          Then we can win by not popping any balloon.

          But we are already popping in earlier tasks? 

          We are not, because we are about to simulate task X. 

          In the algorithm above, before we start task X, we have a state F (which might have been disrupted by pops in tasks 1..X-1). 
          Then if we do not pop in task X, the finish time for task X is F+B_X.

          And if F+B_X > M, then we win: Budi does not complete the X-th task.

          And we have not popped any balloon in task X. And we didn't need to. 

          Therefore, at the start of task X, after adding the balloon, we can check:

              if F > M: 
                  // then even before task X, we already won -> output and return.
              else if F + B_X > M:
                  // then we win by not popping any balloon in task X and not using any of the remaining tasks.
                  // But we haven't popped any balloon in task X? and we haven't used the new balloon? 
                  // Then the total popping times are the ones we have from earlier tasks.
                  // But we can win, so output the current popping_times.

                  However, we are at task X, and we haven't finished it. The condition is F + B_X > M, so the task X is not completed.

                  Therefore, we output the current popping_times and return.

          But note: we might have used some balloons in earlier tasks, and then we output them. 

          In sample#2 at X=5: 
              After 4 tasks, we have a state F (which might be large), and then we add the balloon at time S[5]=50.
              Then we check: if F>M: ... 
                   or if F+B[5] > M: 
              In sample#2, after 4 tasks without any pops: 
                  F = 15+12+19+17 = 63? 
                  then at X=5: F>50 -> we output the popping_times (which is empty) and then we output 0.

          But we encounter X=5 only if we get to it. We might have won at an earlier X.

          Therefore, we should break out as soon as we win.

          We can win at the current task without popping in this task if F>M or if F+B_X>M.

          But note: F is the state after the first X-1 tasks. Then:
              if F > M: then Budi has not completed the first X-1 tasks -> then he has solved at most X-2 tasks. 
                 Ayu has solved X-1 tasks? 
                 But we are at X: we are about to consider Ayu solving X tasks.

          This is not matching: we require that Ayu has solved X tasks, and we are at the simulation for X.

          We just added the balloon for the X-th task. 

          Therefore, Ayu has solved X tasks. And Budi has solved at most X-1 tasks? 
             if F > M: then Budi has not completed the first X-1 tasks, so he has solved at most X-2 tasks? 
                 then X > X-2 -> valid.
             if F+B_X > M: then Budi has not completed the X-th task, and he has completed the first X-1 tasks? not necessarily: the first X-1 tasks might have been completed or not.

          We need to know how many tasks Budi has completed. 

          He completes a task if the finish time of the task is <= M and not ruined by a pop at the exact finish time.

          In our simulation, the finish time for a task j is F_j = F_{j-1} + (k_j+1)*B_j.

          And we ensure that the popping times are <= M.

          The condition for a task to be completed: 
              F_j <= M.

          Therefore, the number of tasks completed by Budi is the largest j such that F_j <= M.

          In our simulation, after task X-1, we have F = F_{X-1} (state) for the start of task X.

          Then if F > M, then the last task (X-1) was not completed. And the one before might or might not.

          But we don't track the number of completed tasks.

          Alternatively, we can compute: the number of tasks completed is the number of tasks j for which the finish time F_j <= M.

          But we are not storing the finish time for each task.

          Given the complexity, and since the problem allows any configuration, and we are iterating X in increasing order, we can output the plan as soon as at the start of task X (before any pops in task X) we have F > M or F+B_X>M.

          Specifically:

              if F > M:
                  // then we have already prevented Budi from completing the first X-1 tasks.
                  // Ayu has solved X tasks.
                  // Budi has completed at most X-2 tasks.
                  // So we output the current popping_times and return.
              else if F + B_X > M:
                  // then even without any pops in this task, the X-th task is not completed.
                  // then we output the current popping_times and return.

          In sample#2, for X=5: 
              After 4 tasks, we have F = 15+12+19+17 = 63>50 -> we output the current popping_times (which is empty) -> 0.

          In sample#2, can we win at an earlier X? 
              We iterate X from 1 to 5.
              X=1: 
                  after adding balloon, F=0 (state) for task1.
                  if 0>50? no.
                  if 0+15>50? no.
                  then simulate task1: with or without pops? 
                      as above, we might use pops and set F=30.
                  then after task1: F=30.
              X=2:
                  add balloon at 20.
                  if 30>50? no.
                  if 30+12>50? 42>50? no.
                  then simulate task2: 
                      as above, we might use pops and set F=54.
              X=3:
                  add balloon at 30.
                  if 54>50 -> yes, then output the current popping_times = [15,42] and return.

          Therefore, we win at X=3 with 2 pops.

          But the sample output is 0 for X=5.

          The problem: output any configuration. Either is valid.

          However, the sample provided output is 0, so we must output 0 for sample#2.

          How to force that? 

          We can try to win with 0 pops by letting X be the number of tasks solved by Ayu, and win if the natural time for the first X tasks of Budi (without any pops) is > M.

          But in the sample, the natural time for the first 5 tasks is 83>50, so we win at X=5 with 0 pops.

          Therefore, at the beginning of each X, after adding the balloon, we can compute the natural time for the first X tasks of Budi as U[X] = B1+B2+...+B_X.

          Then if U[X] > M, then we win with 0 pops (for this X).

          But note: this is the natural time without any disruption. In our simulation, we might have used some pops and delayed the tasks, so U[X] is not the actual time. 

          However, if U[X] > M, then even without any pops, Budi does not complete the X-th task in the natural time. Therefore, we win.

          Therefore, we can do:

              for X in 1..N:
                  if S[X] > M: break
                  if U[X] > M: 
                      // output 0 pops and return.

                  // else, do the simulation for task X with the heap and pops.

                  // Also, after the simulation, if F > M: 
                      // output the popping_times and return.

          In sample#2, at X=5, we have U[5]=83>50 -> output 0.

          In sample#2, we never do the popping simulation for X<5.

          But can we win at an earlier X? 
              The problem requires only to output any configuration. We choose to output the 0-pop one for the smallest X for which it is possible.

          However, we iterate X in increasing order, and we first encounter a win at X=5.

          Therefore, we output 0.

          In sample#1, U[1]=4<=30, U[2]=14<=30, U[3]=19<=30, so we do the popping simulation.

          This meets the sample outputs.

          Therefore, the final algorithm:

              Precompute an array U[0..N]: U[0]=0, U[i]=U[i-1]+B_i.

              F = 0
              heap = []
              popping_times = []

              for X in range(1, N+1):
                  if S[X] > M: 
                      break   // Ayu cannot solve X tasks

                  // Add the balloon at time S[X]
                  heapq.heappush(heap, S[X])

                  // Check: if U[X] > M:
                      print(0)
                      return

                  // Now simulate task X (Budi's task j=X) 
                  //   But if we have already F > M, then we can output here? 
                  //   Or after the check for U[X] we know U[X]<=M, but our F might be >M from previous disruptions.
                  if F > M:
                      // output popping_times and return
                      // But we haven't done task X? doesn't matter, since the first X-1 tasks are not completed.
                      // However, the popping_times we have might be enough.
                      // We can output now.
                      print( len(popping_times) )
                      // output popping_times in increasing order (they are in increasing order by the order of being added)
                      print( " ".join(map(str, popping_times)) 
                      return

                  // Now let the current task be Budi's task X, with time B_X = B[X]

                  k0 = min( len(heap), (M - F) // B[X] ) 

                  i = 1
                  while i <= k0 and heap and heap[0] <= F + i * B[X]:
                      s = heapq.heappop(heap)
                      t = F + i * B[X]
                      popping_times.append(t)
                      i += 1

                  k = i-1
                  F = F + (k+1)*B[X]

                  if F > M:
                      print( len(popping_times) )
                      print( " ".join(map(str, popping_times)) 
                      return

              // If we get here, no win
              print(-1)

  Let's run sample#1:

      U[1]=4, U[2]=14, U[3]=19.

      X=1: 
          push(9)
          U[1]=4<=30 -> skip
          F=0<=30, then task1: B[1]=4, k0 = min(1, 30//4=7) -> 1.
          i=1: heap[0]=9<=0+4? 9<=4 -> false -> k=0.
          F=0+ (0+1)*4=4.

      X=2:
          push(19) -> heap=[9,19] (min-heap: [9,19])
          U[2]=14<=30 -> skip.
          F=4<=30.
          task2: B[2]=10, k0=min(2, (30-4)//10=2) =2.
          i=1: heap[0]=9<=4+10=14 -> true: 
                 pop, add popping_time=4+10=14, i=2.
          i=2: heap[0]=19<=4+20=24 -> true:
                 pop, add popping_time=24, i=3.
          k=2, F=4+3*10=34>30 -> then output: 
              K=2, popping_times=[14,24]

      Output: 
          2
          14 24

  But the sample expected: 2 and "12 19", but our output is also valid.

  Therefore, we output the editorial accordingly.

  Note: The popping_times we output are in the order we used the balloons, and they are in increasing order (because as we do tasks in order, the popping times are F+i*B_j which are increasing).

  This meets the requirements.
