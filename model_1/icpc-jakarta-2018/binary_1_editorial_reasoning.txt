We are given an integer K (1 <= K <= 2^60) and a binary string S (length between 1 and 60) with no leading zeros.
We need to remove a minimum number of bits from S (while maintaining the order) so that the resulting binary string (without leading zeros) has a decimal value <= K.

Note: The resulting string must not have leading zeros. This implies that if we leave an empty string, that is not allowed? But note the problem says "non-empty". However, the problem says "remove zero or more bits" and the string must be non-empty? Actually, the problem says "binary string is a non-empty sequence", so we cannot remove all bits.

However, note the input says S is non-empty and has no leading zeros. After removal, the resulting string must also be non-empty and without leading zeros. So if we leave a string that starts with '0', that is not allowed.

Approach:

Since the length of S is at most 60, we can consider dynamic programming or greedy with state that considers the position and the current value? However, note that the value can be as large as 2^60, which is too big for a state.

But note: the length of the remaining string can be at most 60, but we are only going to consider numbers that are at most K (which is at most 2^60). However, we cannot store the value in the state because of its size.

Alternative idea:

We are to find the minimum removals (say, r) such that there exists a subsequence of S (with length = |S| - r) that forms a binary number without leading zeros and value <= K.

We can try to use the following:

1. We note that the answer must be between 0 and |S| - 1 (since we cannot remove all, but note: if we remove all we are not allowed, but we might have to leave at least one. Actually, if K>=1, then we can always leave a single '1'? But if K==0, then we cannot have any number? However, K>=1 per input).

So we can leave at least one bit. The minimal representation we can leave is a single '1' (if there's any '1') or a single '0'? But note: the resulting string must not have leading zeros. So if we leave a single '0', that is allowed? Actually, the problem says "non-empty sequence" and "no leading zeros" — a single zero is allowed? But note: the problem says the original S has no leading zeros, but after removal we might have a zero? 

However, consider: if we leave a zero, then the entire number is zero. But the problem states that the calculator cannot work on any integer larger than K. So if K>=0? But note K>=1, so zero is allowed? However, the problem says "convert into decimal representation" and zero is a valid decimal. But note: the problem says "favorite binary string" has no leading zeros, but after removal, if we leave a string that starts with zero, then it must be the only digit? Actually, the condition is "must not contain any leading zeroes", meaning that the first character must be '1' (unless the entire string is "0", but we cannot form "0" by leaving a single zero? Actually, we can: if we leave a single zero, that is allowed? But the problem says "non-empty", and zero is non-empty? And the condition "no leading zeros" for a string "0" — the first character is zero and then the rest is nothing, so that is acceptable? 

But note: the problem says "the resulting binary string also must not contain any leading zeroes". The string "0" has no leading zero? Actually, it has a zero as the only digit, and that is acceptable. However, if we have "00", that would not be acceptable because the first digit is zero and then we have more? So we can leave a string that is "0", but we cannot leave a string that starts with zero and then has more digits? 

Therefore, we can leave a string that is "0" (if we have a zero in S) and that is acceptable. The value is 0, which is <= K (since K>=1).

But wait: if we have a string that becomes "0", then we have to remove all the ones? However, we can also leave a single zero. So if K>=0, then we can leave a zero? But note: K>=1, so zero is allowed.

However, the problem says: "Ayu has a favorite binary string S which contains no leading zeroes." — meaning the entire S doesn't start with zero. But S might contain zeros elsewhere.

But note: we can remove bits arbitrarily. So we can pick a zero that is not at the beginning? Actually, we cannot leave a zero at the beginning if there are no ones? But if we leave a zero that is at the beginning of the resulting string, then we cannot have any other digits? So if we leave a zero, then we must leave only that one zero.

Therefore, we can consider two types of solutions:
  a) The resulting string is "0" (if we leave one zero from anywhere? but note: if we leave a zero that is not the first, then we can only leave that zero and nothing else? Actually, if we leave one zero, then the entire string is "0", which is acceptable. So we can choose any zero in S and remove all other bits? Then the value is 0.

  b) The resulting string starts with '1' and then can have zeros and ones.

So the minimal removal might be achieved by leaving a single zero? Then the removals are |S| - 1. But we might get a lower removal count by leaving a positive number? 

Therefore, we have two possibilities: either we leave a single zero (if there is any zero in S) or we leave a positive number (which must start with '1').

So the answer might be min(|S|-1, ...) but note: leaving a positive number might require fewer removals? 

But note: if we leave a positive number, then the number must be at most K. And we want to minimize removals.

How to solve:

We are to minimize the removals r, which is equivalent to maximize the length of the remaining subsequence, but note: we might have a shorter subsequence that has a larger value? So we want the longest subsequence that forms a number <= K? But not exactly: we want to minimize removals, so we want the largest possible subsequence (minimal removals) that forms a number <= K and without leading zeros.

But note: if two subsequences have the same length, we care about the value? Actually, we want the minimal removals. So we can iterate on the length of the remaining subsequence from high to low? Since the maximum length we can have is |S|, then |S|-1, ... until we find a length L for which there exists a subsequence of length L that forms a binary number without leading zeros and value <= K.

But note: if we have two subsequences of the same length, we don't care which one we take as long as one of them has value<=K. We are just checking existence per length.

But also note: we have two types: the zero case (which is length=1, value=0) is always acceptable? Since K>=1.

So if we can leave a zero, then we have a candidate with removals |S|-1.

But we might leave a positive number with a longer length? So we should try the largest possible L (from |S| down to 1) and check: is there a subsequence of length L that forms a valid number (without leading zeros) and value <= K?

If we find one for a given L, then the minimal removals is |S| - L.

How to check for a fixed L? 

We want to know: is there a subsequence of S that has length L, starts with '1' (or if L=1, then it can be a zero? Actually, we have two cases: 
  - If L==1, then we can have either '0' or '1'. But note: if we choose a zero, the value is 0. If we choose a one, the value is 1. Both are <=K (since K>=1). So we can always form a number of length 1? So the minimal removals is at most |S|-1.

But we are looking for the minimal removals, so we want the largest possible L.

So we can iterate L from |S| down to 1:

  Check if there exists a subsequence of S of length L that forms a binary number without leading zeros and value<=K.

  - For L=1: as above, always exists? So we can break at L=1? But we want the largest L.

Therefore, we are going from L = |S|, |S|-1, ... until we find one.

But note: we might skip the zero case? Actually, the zero case is only for L=1? And we already consider L=1. So we don't need to consider zero separately? Because if we have a zero, then we have a candidate for L=1. But also we have a candidate of '1' for L=1. So we are covered.

But note: for L>=2, the subsequence must start with '1'. So we can only use the first character if it is '1'? Actually, we can use a '1' that is not the first? But then we skip the first? However, the condition: we must not have leading zeros. So the first character of the subsequence must be '1'.

So for L>=2, we must have the first character of the subsequence being '1'. For L=1, we can have either '0' or '1'.

How to check for a fixed L? 

We can use dynamic programming:

Let n = |S|

We want to know: is there a subsequence of length L that forms a number <= K and that starts with a '1' (if L>=2) or any digit (if L=1) but if we choose a zero for L=1, that's acceptable.

But note: the value of the subsequence can be very large (but note: L is at most 60, so the number is at most 2^60 - 1, which is about 1e18, but we are comparing to K which is up to 2^60). However, we cannot iterate over the value.

Alternative: we can use DP that considers:

  dp[i][j] = the minimum possible value (or a representation of the number) of the subsequence we have formed from the prefix S[0:i] that has length j and ends with the last character at i? 

But then we have to store the value, which is too big.

But note: we only care about the value relative to K. And we want to know if there is any subsequence that is <=K.

We can use state: dp[i][j] = the minimum value (but we cannot store the value) or we can use state: dp[i][j] = a boolean: is there a subsequence of length j ending at i that is <= K? But we don't know the value and we have to compare.

Alternatively, we can use state: dp[i][j] = the smallest possible value of a subsequence of length j that ends at i. But then we have to compute the value for every state? The state is O(n^2) = 60*60=3600, which is acceptable? But the values are up to 2^60, which we can store as integers? We can use unsigned long long in C++? But 3600 states is acceptable.

But note: the problem constraints: K up to 2^60, but we can use 64-bit integers.

But worst-case: we might have 3600 states, and we can store the value as an integer. So we can do:

Let dp[i][j] = the minimal value (or a value that is the smallest possible) of a subsequence of length j that is contained in the prefix S[0..i] and that ends at i.

But note: we want the entire subsequence, not just ending at i? Actually, we can design:

We iterate i from 0 to n-1:

  For j from 1 to min(i+1, L): 

      We consider: the subsequence ending at i. We need to extend a subsequence that ends at some k < i, and then append S[i]. But we can also start at i.

How to compute:

  If we start at i: then j=1, value = (S[i]=='1'? 1 : 0). But note: if we start at i and j=1, and S[i]=='0', then value=0, which is acceptable.

  For j>=2: we require that the previous character is at some index k < i, and the subsequence from k has length j-1 and ends at k. Then the new value = value_at_k * 2 + (S[i]-'0').

But note: the subsequence must be contiguous? No, we can skip arbitrary bits. So we can take any subsequence.

But then we have to consider all k < i? 

But note: the value for the subsequence is computed by: 
  Let the subsequence be b0, b1, ... , b_{j-1} (with b0 the most significant). Then the value is sum_{t=0}^{j-1} b_t * 2^(j-1-t).

And we are building the subsequence from left to right? But we are iterating i (the index in S). So we are building the subsequence in the order of S.

We can do:

  dp[i][1] = (S[i]=='1' ? 1 : 0)   [if we take a single character at i]

  For j from 2 to min(L, i+1):
      dp[i][j] = a big number (like 2*K, but we don't want to exceed K? Actually, we can set to a value that is above K, then we don't care? But we are going to compare to K. We can set to a sentinel value that means "infinite" or "too big".)

      Then we iterate over k from 0 to i-1:

          If we have a state at k with length j-1: then we can form a subsequence of length j by taking the subsequence ending at k and then appending S[i]. The value = dp[k][j-1] * 2 + (S[i]-'0').

          Then we want the minimal value for dp[i][j] (over k). But note: we are only interested in values <=K? Actually, we can store the minimal value that is <=K? But we can also store the minimal value regardless and then at the end we check if any state is <=K.

However, the minimal value might be too big? We can do:

          candidate = dp[k][j-1] * 2 + (S[i]-'0')
          If candidate > K: then we can mark it as too big? But we still need to compare with other candidates? Actually, we are looking for the minimal candidate? But if we have a candidate that is <=K, we want to remember it. But if all candidates are >K, then we set dp[i][j] to a big number.

But note: we are iterating for a fixed j and i. We can do:

          candidate = dp[k][j-1] * 2 + (S[i]-'0')
          Then we set dp[i][j] = min(current dp[i][j], candidate)   but we have to consider all k.

But also note: the subsequence must not have leading zeros. For j>=2, the first character must be '1'. How do we ensure that? 

Actually, we build the subsequence from the beginning: if we start with a '0', then that subsequence for j>=2 would have a leading zero? So we must avoid that. How? 

We can enforce that for j>=2, we only consider states that start with a '1'. How? 

In our dp, when we start with a single character (j=1) and it is a '1', then we have a state that is 1. Then for j>=2, we only extend states that have been started with a '1'. But what if we start with a zero? Then we cannot extend? Actually, we don't start with a zero for j>=2? So we skip any state that started with a zero for j>=2? 

But note: we are building the subsequence arbitrarily. The state at k might have started with a zero? Actually, no: because if we have a state at k for j-1, then if j-1>=2, the state must have started with a '1'. But if j-1=1, then the state at k could be a zero? Then we are appending S[i] to a zero? Then the entire number would be 0...0? But that is not allowed for j>=2: because the first digit is zero? 

So we must avoid: we only extend states that are started with a '1'. How? 

We can design: we only allow states that are started with a '1'. But note: if we have a state that is of length 1 and the value is 0 (i.e., we took a zero at k), then we cannot use that to extend? Because the subsequence would become 0 and then S[i] -> which is 0x or 1x? But that has a leading zero? So we must not use a state that started with a zero for j>=2.

Therefore, we can do: for j>=2, we only consider k such that the state dp[k][j-1] is defined and the subsequence represented by dp[k][j-1] is not zero? Actually, we can simply avoid using states that have value 0 for j-1? But note: if we have a state that started with a '1' and then became zero? That's impossible. The state value is the entire number. 

Alternatively, we can note: the state for j-1 must be at least 1? Because if j-1>=1 and the state was started with a '1', then the value is at least 1. But if we have a state that started with a zero? Then we don't use it for j>=2.

So we can do: for j>=2, we only consider k such that the state dp[k][j-1] is defined and the value is not zero? Actually, we can avoid k that have a value of 0 for j-1? But wait: if j-1=1 and we took a zero, that state has value 0. We skip that.

But also, we can avoid building states for j>=2 from a state that has j-1 and value 0? 

So in our dp, for j=1, we build both zeros and ones. For j>=2, we only build from states that are non-zero? Actually, we can build from any state that we have, but then the value would be 0*2 + (S[i]-'0') = (S[i]-'0'). But then the entire number would be a one-digit number? No, because we have two digits: the first is the one we took at k (which was zero) and then we append S[i]. So the number is "0" followed by S[i]. But that is not allowed because of leading zeros? So we skip.

Therefore, for j>=2, we only consider states k such that the state dp[k][j-1] is defined and the value is at least 1? Actually, we can skip states that started with a zero? How? 

We can note: the state for j-1 must have been started with a '1'. How to enforce? 

We can do: we require that the state for j-1 must have been started at an index where the character is '1'. Actually, that is not enough: because the state might have started with a '1' and then we extended? But the state dp[k][j-1] is the entire number. We don't know the starting character? 

But note: if the state for j-1 is non-zero, then the first character must be '1'. Because if the first character were '0', the entire number would be zero? Actually, no: we might have "01" which is not allowed? Actually, we never build such state for j>=2: because we skip states that start with zero? 

So to avoid leading zeros, we can do:

  For j=1: we allow any character.

  For j>=2: we only extend from a state that has j-1 and that has a non-zero value? Actually, the value of the state for j-1 is non-zero if and only if the subsequence has a first character '1'. Because if the first character is '1', then the value is at least 2^(j-2) (if j-1>=1) but wait: for j-1=1, non-zero means the value is 1. 

But note: we can have a state for j-1 that is non-zero only if the first character is '1'. Because if the first character is '0', then the entire subsequence must be all zeros? Actually, no: if we have "01", then the value is 1? But that is not allowed because of leading zeros. We never built that state? 

We must not build such state. How? 

In our dp for j=2: we are going to consider k for j-1 (j-1=1). If we take a state k that has a zero (value 0) and then we append a '1', then we get the number "01", which is 1. But that is the same as taking a single '1'. So we can avoid by not building states that have leading zeros? 

But note: we are building the subsequence by taking the bits in order. The state at k for j-1=1: if we took a zero at k, then we are going to form a two-digit number that starts with zero? which is not allowed. Therefore, we must skip such state.

So we can do: for j>=2, we only extend from states that are for j-1 and that have a non-zero value? Actually, the value of the state for j-1 might be zero only when we took a zero. So we skip states that have value 0 for j-1? 

But note: if we have a state for j-1 that is non-zero, then we can extend. So:

  For j>=2, we iterate k from 0 to i-1 such that dp[k][j-1] is defined and dp[k][j-1] > 0.

But then we can form:

  candidate = dp[k][j-1] * 2 + (S[i]-'0')
  If candidate <= K, then we can use this candidate to update dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], candidate)   [if we want the minimal value?]

But note: we don't care about the minimal value for the same i,j? Actually, we want to know if there is any subsequence of length j that ends at i and has value<=K. But we are storing the minimal value? Then at the end we can check: if for any i, dp[i][L] <= K, then we have a subsequence of length L.

But we are iterating for a fixed L. Then we break when we find one.

But note: we don't need the minimal value per se? We only care about existence? Then we can store a boolean: exists? But then we lose the ability to compute the value for the next step.

Alternatively, we can do: for each j, we store for each i the minimal value that we can get for the subsequence of length j ending at i. Why minimal? Because when we extend, we want to avoid big numbers? But minimal value might be extended to form a smaller value? Actually, no: the minimal value for the next step is achieved by taking the minimal value at the previous state? 

But note: if we have two subsequences of the same length j-1 ending at two different k, and we are going to append the same bit, then we want the one with the smaller value? Because then the new value = value * 2 + bit will be smaller? 

So we can use: for each j and i, we store the minimal value achievable for a subsequence of length j ending at i. Then when extending, we use the minimal value from previous states to get the minimal candidate? 

But note: we are not forced to take the minimal value? We only care about existence of one subsequence that is <=K. However, if we have a candidate that is minimal, then it is the smallest possible value we can get for that state, and if that minimal value is already > K, then we don't need to consider that state for extending? Actually, we can avoid storing states that are already above K? 

So we can do:

  For each j (from 1 to L) and each i (from 0 to n-1):

      if j==1:
          value = (S[i]=='1' ? 1 : 0)
          if value <= K: then dp[i][1] = value
          else: we skip (but note: if S[i]=='0', value=0<=K; if S[i]=='1', value=1<=K, so always set? unless K=0, but K>=1)

      For j>=2:
          We consider all k from 0 to i-1 such that dp[k][j-1] is defined and dp[k][j-1] > 0 (to avoid leading zeros) and also we require that the new value = dp[k][j-1]*2 + (S[i]-'0') <= K.

          Then we set dp[i][j] = min_{k} { candidate }   (but we don't care about min? we just need one candidate that is <=K? Actually, we can set dp[i][j] = the minimal candidate we get? Then we can use this minimal candidate for further extensions? But if we don't care about extensions, we can just set to the first candidate we find? But we want to extend further? 

          Actually, we are only checking for a fixed L? Then we don't need to extend beyond j? 

But wait: we are iterating j from 1 to L (for a fixed L). We don't need to build j beyond L? Actually, we are checking for a fixed L. So we can do:

          For a fixed L (which we are testing), we only need to compute dp[i][L] for all i? and then if any dp[i][L] <= K, then we have found a subsequence.

But then we don't need the intermediate j from 1 to L-1? Actually, we do: because to compute j=L, we need j=L-1.

So we have to compute for all j from 1 to L. But note: we are iterating L from |S| down to 1. Then for each L, we run a DP that takes O(n^2 * L) = O(n^3) = 60^3 = 216000, which is acceptable? But worst-case L=60, then 60*60*60=216000, which is acceptable.

But note: we are iterating L from |S| down to 1 until we find one. So worst-case we do L = |S|, |S|-1, ... 1 -> total of |S| iterations? Then total operations = |S| * (|S|^3) ? That would be 60 * (60^3) = 60^4 = 12.96e6, which is acceptable in 0.5s? (C++ might be fast enough, but worst-case 12e6 is acceptable in 0.5s? Actually, 12e6 operations in C++ is acceptable.)

But note: we are iterating L from n down to 1, and for each L we run a DP for j=1..L and i=0..n-1, and for each state (i,j) we iterate k from 0 to i-1. The inner loop is O(n) per state. The total states for a fixed L is O(n*L). Then the total for a fixed L is O(n^2 * L). Then over L from n down to 1, the total is:

  Sum_{L=1}^{n} [ n^2 * L ] = n^2 * (n(n+1)/2) = O(n^4).

n is at most 60, then 60^4 = 12.96e6, which is acceptable in 0.5s? Actually, worst-case 12.96e6 iterations might be acceptable in C++ (each iteration is a few operations). But we have to do this in the worst-case? 

But note: we break as soon as we find an L for which there is a subsequence? So we start at L = |S|, then if we find one, we break. Then we only do one L. If we don't find one for L, we go to L-1. So worst-case we do from L = |S|, |S|-1, ... until L=1. That is |S| iterations. And the worst-case is when we don't find any for L>1 and we have to go to L=1? Then we do all L from |S| down to 1. So worst-case we do |S| iterations, each of which runs a DP for j=1..L (which is O(n^2 * L) per L. Then the total operations = n^2 * (1 + 2 + ... + n) = n^2 * n(n+1)/2 = O(n^4). For n=60, that is 60^4=12960000, which is about 12.96e6, acceptable.

But note: we have to be cautious: in the inner loop, for each state (i,j) we iterate k from 0 to i-1 (which is O(n)), so the total for a fixed L is O(n^2 * L). Then the total for all L from 1 to n is O(n^4). 

But we can optimize: if we break early when we find one for a given L, we don't do the entire loop for the rest of the states? Actually, we can: once we set any dp[i][L] to a value <=K, we can break out of the entire DP for this L and return that we found one.

But note: we have to compute the entire dp for j=1 to L? Actually, for a fixed L, we have to compute j=1, then j=2, ... up to j=L. And for j=L, we iterate i. We can break as soon as we set one dp[i][L] to a value<=K? Then we break the inner loop for j=L and then break the entire L.

But note: we have to compute the states for j=1 to L-1 to compute j=L. So we cannot avoid that. But for j=L, we can break early.

So algorithm:

  Let n = |S|
  For L in [n, n-1, ..., 1]:
      Initialize dp as a 2D array of size n x (L+1) (we can use a vector of vectors, or we can use 1D arrays and iterate j from 1 to L).

      For j from 1 to L:
          For i from 0 to n-1:
              if j==1:
                  value = (S[i]=='1') ? 1 : 0
                  dp[i][1] = value
              else:
                  dp[i][j] = a big number (like K+1, or a sentinel)   [meaning we haven't found any]
                  For k from 0 to i-1:
                      if dp[k][j-1] is defined and dp[k][j-1] > 0:   # for j>=2, we require non-zero to avoid leading zeros? Actually, we require non-zero because we are extending an existing number that must have started with '1'. But note: if we have a state that is zero, we skip? But we didn't set any state to zero for j>=2? Actually, we only set states to zero for j=1? Then for j>=2, we only consider states that are non-zero? 
                      candidate = dp[k][j-1] * 2 + (S[i]-'0')
                      if candidate <= K and candidate < dp[i][j]:   # we are storing the minimal candidate? Actually, we can break early? But we want the minimal candidate for extending? 
                          dp[i][j] = candidate

          # But note: we don't need the minimal candidate? We only care if there is one candidate that is <=K. So we can set:
          #   if we found any candidate that is <=K, then we can set dp[i][j] = candidate (and then we don't need to check the rest? Actually, we can break early for the state (i,j) as soon as we find one candidate that is <=K? But then we lose the minimal candidate for extending? However, we are not going to extend beyond j? We are only building for j up to L. So for j==L, we don't need to extend? Then we can do:

          Actually, for j < L, we want the minimal value to extend? But we don't need minimal? We only care about existence? Actually, no: if we have two candidates: one with value 100 and one with value 10, then when we extend, the candidate with 10 might lead to a candidate for j+1 that is 10*2+1=21 which is <=K, while 100*2+1=201 might be too big. So we want to keep the minimal value? 

          Therefore, we should compute the minimal candidate for each state? 

      After computing j=L, we check: for any i in [0, n-1], if dp[i][L] <= K, then we break the L loop and output |S| - L.

  If we go down to L=1, then we break and output |S|-1.

But note: for L=1, we don't need the inner loop? We set dp[i][1] for each i. Then we check: if any dp[i][1] <= K? But they are all 0 or 1, which are <=K (since K>=1). So we will always break at L=1? 

Therefore, we can be sure that we break at L=1.

But what about the condition for j>=2: we require the state for j-1 to be non-zero? Actually, we skip states that are zero? But for j=2, we only use states from j=1 that are non-zero? But note: for j=1, we have states that are zero? Then we skip them for j=2? 

But we don't set states that are zero for j=1? Actually, we set them: 
  if S[i]=='0', then dp[i][1]=0.

Then when j=2, we skip k that have dp[k][1]==0? 

But then we cannot form a two-digit number that starts with a zero? That's correct.

But what if we have a two-digit number that is "00" or "01"? We skip them? That's correct because they are not allowed.

So the algorithm:

  Let n = len(S)
  For L = n down to 1:
      Create a 2D array dp of size n x (L+1) (or we can use 1D arrays for the current j and the previous j? to save memory and time? Actually, we only need j and j-1).

      We can do:

          dp_prev = array of size n, for j-1
          dp_curr = array of size n, for j

      But we iterate j from 1 to L. We need to store all j? Actually, we only need the previous j-1 for the current j.

      Steps for fixed L:

          Let dp0 = new array of length n, for j=1.
          For i in [0, n-1]:
              if S[i]=='1': dp0[i] = 1
              else: dp0[i] = 0

          If L==1: 
              Then we check: if there exists any i such that dp0[i] <= K? (which is always true) -> so we break and output |S|-1? Actually, we break for the current L=1? But we are iterating L from n down to 1, so we start at L=n and then L=n-1, ... until L=1. Then for L=1, we break.

          If L>=2:
              Let dp_prev = dp0   # for j=1
              For j from 2 to L:
                  dp_curr = array of size n, initialize each to a big number (like K+1, or 2*K, but we want to avoid overflow? We can set to K+1, then if we get candidate<=K we update)
                  For i in range(0, n):
                      For k in range(0, i):   # k from 0 to i-1
                          if dp_prev[k] > 0 and dp_prev[k] <= K:   # we only consider states that are non-zero and within K (but if it's above K, we skip)
                              candidate = dp_prev[k] * 2 + (1 if S[i]=='1' else 0)
                              if candidate <= K and candidate < dp_curr[i]:   # we want the minimal candidate for dp_curr[i]? 
                                  dp_curr[i] = candidate
                      # But note: we might not have found any candidate? Then dp_curr[i] remains big.

                  # End for i
                  Then set dp_prev = dp_curr   (for the next j)

              # After finishing j=L, we have dp_prev (which is for j=L) for all i? Then we check: if there exists an i such that dp_prev[i] <= K? Then we break the L loop.

          End if L>=2

      End for fixed L

  Then output |S| - L.

But note: what if we are at L and we don't find any? Then we go to L-1.

But note: for L=1, we break.

However, we must note: for L=1, we have the entire array dp0. We know that at least one element in dp0 is <=K (because they are 0 or 1 and K>=1). So we break at L=1.

But what if L=1 is the first we test? Actually, we start at L=n (which is the largest) and go down. So we only test L=1 if we didn't find any for L>=2.

But we know we will find at L=1.

But worst-case: we try L from n down to 1, and we break at L=1.

But the worst-case running time is O(n^4) as explained.

But note: n is at most 60, and 60^4 = 12.96e6, which is acceptable in C++ in 0.5 seconds? Probably.

However, we can optimize the inner k loop? We are iterating k from 0 to i-1 for each i and j. We can precompute for each j the minimal value in the prefix? But note: we want to minimize candidate = dp_prev[k] * 2 + (S[i]). Since we are multiplying by 2, we want a small dp_prev[k]. So for each i, we want the minimal value of dp_prev[k] for k in [0, i-1] that is non-zero? Then we can update:

  candidate = (min_value) * 2 + (S[i]-'0')

But note: if we have two states: one with value a and one with value b, and a < b, then a*2+bit <= b*2+bit? So the minimal candidate is achieved by the minimal dp_prev[k]? 

Therefore, we can precompute for the dp_prev array (for the previous j) an array min_dp_prev[i] = min{ dp_prev[k] for k=0..i }? But note: we require k from 0 to i-1 (for state i). And also we require dp_prev[k] > 0.

But we cannot use the minimal value arbitrarily? Because we are iterating i from 0 to n-1. We can maintain a running minimum? 

Actually, we can do:

  For the current j, we iterate i from 0 to n-1, and we maintain the minimal value of dp_prev[k] for k from 0 to i-1 (that are non-zero) and then update dp_curr[i] = min_value * 2 + bit.

But note: we must have k < i. And we can update the running minimum as we go.

Steps for fixed j (>=2) in the inner loop:

  Let min_so_far = a big number (or undefined)
  For i from 0 to n-1:
      If i>0, then we update min_so_far = min(min_so_far, dp_prev[i-1])? But we only consider states that are non-zero? 

      But note: we require k from 0 to i-1. So at i, we have seen states k=0 to i-1? Then we can update min_so_far by including dp_prev[i-1] (if it is non-zero and <=K) at the step for i.

      Then if min_so_far is not a big number, then:
          candidate = min_so_far * 2 + (S[i]=='1'?1:0)
          if candidate <= K:
              dp_curr[i] = candidate
          else:
              dp_curr[i] = big number   (or we can leave it as big)
      Else: dp_curr[i] = big number.

      Then after updating dp_curr[i], we then update min_so_far for the next i? Actually, we haven't included the state at i in the min_so_far? But we are at state i, and we are going to use min_so_far for the next state? But note: min_so_far is for states k from 0 to i-1. Then we update min_so_far for the next i by including the state at i? 

      But wait: for the next state i+1, we want min_so_far to include states k from 0 to i. So at the end of the i-th iteration, we update:

          if dp_prev[i] > 0 and dp_prev[i] <= K:   # we only consider states that are non-zero and <=K? Actually, we stored dp_prev[i] as a big number if it was above K? Then we skip.
          then min_so_far = min(min_so_far, dp_prev[i])

      However, note: we are building dp_curr for j, and we have not computed dp_prev for the entire array? Actually, we are iterating i from 0 to n-1 for the current j, and we have the entire dp_prev array from the previous j? So we can precompute an array M for the entire dp_prev: 

          Let M[i] = the minimal value of dp_prev[k] for k in [0, i] (and that are non-zero and <=K) or a big number if none.

      But note: we require k from 0 to i-1 for state i. So we can use:

          Let M = an array of size n: 
          M[0] = big number   (because no state k in [0,-1])
          For i from 1 to n-1: 
             M[i] = min(M[i-1], dp_prev[i-1])   ? But we only want non-zero? Actually, we stored dp_prev as big numbers for states that are not set? And we set states that are zero? 

      Actually, we stored states that are zero for j=1. For j>=2, we did not set states that are zero? So for j>=2, we set states that are non-zero? 

      But for j=1, we have states that are zero? Then for j=2, we skip them? So we can precompute:

          min_prev = big number
          For i from 0 to n-1:
              if we are to compute dp_curr[i]:
                 if min_prev is big: then skip (cannot form)
                 else: candidate = min_prev * 2 + (S[i]=='1'?1:0)
                 if candidate<=K: then set dp_curr[i]=candidate, else set to big.

              Then update min_prev = min(min_prev, dp_prev[i])? But note: we require non-zero? Actually, we stored non-zero states? Or we stored states that are zero? 

      How about: we precomputed the entire dp_prev for j-1? Then we can create an array M such that:

          M[i] = minimum value of dp_prev[k] for k=0..i (and we only consider states that are non-zero and <=K? Actually, we stored the minimal value we could get, and we set to a big number if we couldn't? Then we can do:

          Let min_arr = array of length n: min_arr[i] = min_{k=0}^{i} { dp_prev[k] }   but we want to skip big numbers? 

      Alternatively, we can do:

          min_so_far = a big number (like K+1)
          For i from 0 to n-1:
              # For the next state (which will use states k from 0 to i-1) we have min_so_far
              # Then for state i (in dp_curr) we compute candidate = min_so_far * 2 + (S[i]=='1'?1:0)   [if min_so_far is not big]
              # Then we set dp_curr[i] = candidate (if candidate<=K) or big otherwise.

              # Then we update min_so_far = min(min_so_far, dp_prev[i])   [but note: dp_prev[i] might be big? Then we skip?]

          But note: we require to update min_so_far for the next i? And for the next state i+1, we want min_so_far to include states k=0..i.

      However, we must skip states that are not set? We stored states that are not set as big numbers? Then we can update min_so_far = min(min_so_far, dp_prev[i]) only if dp_prev[i] <= K and dp_prev[i] > 0? Actually, for j>=2, we set states only if they are non-zero? But we set to a big number if we didn't find any candidate? Then we update min_so_far only if dp_prev[i] <= K? 

      Actually, we can update min_so_far with any state that is <=K? Because we are only going to use states that are <=K for the next j? 

      But note: we stored states that are minimal? So we can update:

          min_so_far = min(min_so_far, dp_prev[i])

      Then after the entire loop, we have dp_curr.

      But note: we require that the state k has to be non-zero? Actually, we didn't set any state to zero for j>=2? Because we skipped states that are zero? So we don't have to worry about zero.

      However, we set states to zero for j=1? Then when j=2, we skip them? So for j=2, we are not including the states that are zero? 

      How did we skip? In the precomputation of min_so_far: we start with min_so_far = big. Then when we see a state that is zero (in dp_prev for j=1), we skip? But we don't skip: we set min_so_far = min(min_so_far, 0) = 0. Then for the next state i, we use min_so_far=0? Then we form candidate = 0*2+bit. Then we set dp_curr[i] = bit? But that is not allowed: because we are forming a two-digit number that starts with zero? 

      Therefore, we must not include states that are zero? 

      So we have to do:

          min_so_far = big
          For i from 0 to n-1:
              candidate = (if min_so_far is big then skip; else min_so_far * 2 + (S[i]=='1'?1:0))
              if candidate <= K: 
                  dp_curr[i] = candidate
              else:
                  dp_curr[i] = big

              # Now update min_so_far with dp_prev[i] only if dp_prev[i] is non-zero and <=K? But we set to big if above K? Then we can update only if dp_prev[i] <= K and dp_prev[i] > 0? 

              if dp_prev[i] > 0 and dp_prev[i] <= K:
                  min_so_far = min(min_so_far, dp_prev[i])

      But note: we start min_so_far as big. Then the first state i=0: 
          candidate: skip because min_so_far is big -> so dp_curr[0]=big
          Then we update min_so_far: if dp_prev[0] is non-zero and <=K, then min_so_far = min(big, dp_prev[0]) = dp_prev[0]

      Then for i=1: candidate = min_so_far * 2 + bit -> which is dp_prev[0]*2+bit, and if that is <=K, then set.

      But what if dp_prev[0] is zero? Then we skip updating min_so_far? Then min_so_far remains big? Then for i=1, we skip? 

      How do we handle j=2? We must skip states that are zero? 

      Therefore, we must not set min_so_far to zero? 

      So we can do:

          min_so_far = big
          For i from 0 to n-1:
              # if min_so_far is not big, then we can form candidate
              if min_so_far != big:
                  candidate = min_so_far * 2 + (1 if S[i]=='1' else 0)
                  if candidate <= K:
                      dp_curr[i] = candidate
                  else:
                      dp_curr[i] = big
              else:
                  dp_curr[i] = big

              # Now update min_so_far: 
              if dp_prev[i] != big and dp_prev[i] > 0:   # we skip zero? Actually, for j=1, we have states that are zero? Then we skip them? 
                  if min_so_far == big:
                      min_so_far = dp_prev[i]
                  else:
                      min_so_far = min(min_so_far, dp_prev[i])

      This way, we avoid zero? 

      But note: for j=1, we have states that are zero? Then we skip them? So we don't use them for j=2? 

      That is what we want.

      Then for j>=2, we only extend from states that are non-zero.

      But note: for j>=2, the state dp_prev[i] might be set to a big number? Then we skip? 

      So this inner loop for j>=2 becomes O(n) per j.

      Then for a fixed L, we do j from 2 to L, and each j is O(n). Then total for fixed L is O(L*n). Then the entire algorithm (for all L from n down to 1) is O(n^3) (because the sum of L is O(n^2))? 

      Actually: 
          For L = n: we do j=1: O(n), then j=2 to n: each j takes O(n), so total O(n^2)
          For L = n-1: we do j=1: O(n), then j=2 to n-1: O(n*(n-1))? Actually, for each L we do j=1..L: and each j (>=2) takes O(n). Then for a fixed L: O(L*n). Then the total over L from 1 to n is:

          T = n * (1 + 2 + ... + n)  ? 

          Actually, we do for L = n: j=1..n -> n steps: for j=1: O(n), for j=2..n: each O(n) -> total O(n^2)
          For L = n-1: j=1..n-1: total O(n*(n-1)) = O(n^2)
          ...

          Then total = O(n^3) because there are n values of L, and each L takes O(n^2) -> O(n^3) = 60^3 = 216000, which is acceptable.

      Therefore, we can optimize the inner j loop to O(n) per j.

  Algorithm for fixed L:

      Initialize an array dp_prev of length n for j=1: 
          for i in range(n):
              if S[i]=='1': dp_prev[i]=1
              else: dp_prev[i]=0

      If L==1:
          if there is any dp_prev[i] <= K: then we break and output |S|-1.

      Else:
          found = False
          For j from 2 to L:
              dp_curr = array of length n, initialize to a big number (or a sentinel like K+1, or we use a flag)
              min_so_far = big   (a number > K, or we use a big constant like 2**100, but we can use K+1? Actually, we can set to a constant that is > K, but note: we use min_so_far to multiply by 2, so we must avoid overflow? We can use a big number that is at least 2*K+10)

              For i from 0 to n-1:
                  # Check if we can form a state ending at i for j
                  if min_so_far <= K:   # but if min_so_far is big, skip
                      candidate = min_so_far * 2 + (1 if S[i]=='1' else 0)
                      if candidate <= K:
                          dp_curr[i] = candidate
                  # Else: leave dp_curr[i] as big

                  # Update min_so_far with dp_prev[i] (if it is non-zero and valid) 
                  if dp_prev[i] > 0 and dp_prev[i] <= K:
                      if min_so_far > K: 
                          min_so_far = dp_prev[i]
                      else:
                          min_so_far = min(min_so_far, dp_prev[i])

              # Then set dp_prev = dp_curr for the next j

          # After j from 2 to L, we have dp_prev for j=L? Then check: if there exists i such that dp_prev[i] <= K, then found=True.

      Then if found: break the L loop.

  Then output |S| - L.

But note: we must be cautious with the big number: we set min_so_far to a big number. Then we update min_so_far only when we see a valid state? 

  Example: 
      j=2: 
          min_so_far starts as big.
          i=0: 
              candidate: skip because min_so_far is big -> dp_curr[0]=big.
              then update min_so_far: if dp_prev[0] (for j=1) is non-zero and <=K, then set min_so_far = dp_prev[0]. 
          i=1: 
              candidate = min_so_far * 2 + (S[1]=='1'?1:0) -> if that is <=K, then set dp_curr[1]=candidate.
              then update min_so_far: min(min_so_far, dp_prev[1]) -> which is min(previous, current)

  This is correct.

But note: we are only taking the minimal value in the prefix? Why minimal? Because we want to form the smallest number? Then when we extend, we get the smallest possible? 

  But we are only checking existence? However, by using the minimal value we ensure that we get the smallest candidate for the next state? Then we can form as many as possible? 

  Actually, we are storing for each i the minimal value that can be achieved for a subsequence of length j ending at i? But we are not storing for each i? We are storing only one value: the minimal value in the entire prefix? 

  But then we set dp_curr[i] = min_so_far * 2 + bit? 

  This is not the minimal value for the state i? Because there might be a state k that is not minimal but yields a smaller candidate? 

  Example: 
      j=2, we have two states at k: 
          k0: value=3 (at index0)
          k1: value=2 (at index1)
      Then at i=2: 
          min_so_far = min(3,2)=2
          then candidate = 2*2 + S[2] = 4 or 5.

      But what if we use k0 for i=2? then candidate = 3*2 + S[2] = 6 or 7, which is bigger.

      So we are setting the minimal candidate for the state i? 

      Actually, we want the minimal candidate for the state i? Then we should use the minimal value from any k in [0, i-1]. And that minimal value is min_so_far. 

      Therefore, we are setting dp_curr[i] to the minimal candidate we can get.

  So we are storing the minimal value for the state i? 

  But note: we are not storing the minimal value per state? We are storing the minimal value in the entire prefix? Then for state i, we set candidate = min_so_far * 2 + bit. 

  But min_so_far is the minimal value in the prefix [0, i-1]? Then yes, that yields the minimal candidate for state i.

  Therefore, the algorithm is:

      n = len(S)
      # We iterate L from n down to 1:
      for L in range(n, 0, -1):

                      if min_so_far > K:
                          min_so_far = dp_prev[i]
                      else:
                          min_so_far = min(min_so_far, dp_prev[i])

              # After j, set dp_prev = dp_curr for the next iteration
              dp_prev = dp_curr

          # Now after building j=L, check dp_prev: if there is any i such that dp_prev[i] <= K, then we break.
          for i in range(n):
              if dp_prev[i] <= K:
                  removals = n - L
                  print(removals)
                  return   # or break the outer loop

      # Since we break at L=1, we don't need to worry about no solution.

But note: we break the outer loop as soon as we find an L that works.

  However, we break the inner loop for j in the middle? Actually, we build j from 2 to L. Then we check at the end of building j=L.

  We must note: if at any j in [2, L] we have no state (i.e., min_so_far remains BIG throughout and then for the next j we have no state), then we skip.

  We break the outer loop only when we find an L for which the state at j=L has at least one state that is <=K.

  Since we know L=1 always works, we break at L=1.

  But what if we are testing L and at some j in the middle (say j0) we have no state? Then we set dp_prev for j0 as all BIG. Then for j0+1, we start with min_so_far = BIG and then we get no state? Then we set dp_prev for j0+1 as all BIG. Then at the end (j=L) we have no state? Then we skip.

  Then we go to L-1.

  This is correct.

  We must set BIG appropriately: we can set BIG = (10**18)*100 or something? But K can be up to 2^60 (about 1e18). We can set BIG = 2*K + 100? But note: we do multiplications: candidate = min_so_far * 2 + bit. If min_so_far is BIG, then candidate might be very big? But we don't care because we check candidate<=K? 

  Actually, if min_so_far is BIG (which is >K), then we skip candidate. 

  We can do:

      BIG = 10**18 * 10   # a number that is definitely > 2^60 * 2 + 1

  But we can use:

      BIG = (1 << 61)   # which is 2^61, which is > 2^60 * 2 + 1, and K<=2^60.

  But we can also use:

      if min_so_far > K: then candidate = min_so_far * 2 + ... will be > K? Then we skip.

  So we can set BIG = K+1. Then min_so_far = K+1 is >K, so we skip candidate.

  However, note: we update min_so_far = min(min_so_far, dp_prev[i]). If dp_prev[i] is BIG, then min_so_far remains BIG? 

  So we can set BIG = K+1.

  Steps:

      BIG = K+1

  Then for j=1: 
      dp_prev[i] = 0 or 1, both <=K (if K>=1) so we set as 0 or 1.

  Then for j=2:
      min_so_far = BIG (initially)
      Then we update min_so_far: we skip any dp_prev[i] that is 0? But we have states that are 1? Then we set min_so_far = 1 (if we see a state with 1).

  Then for the next i, we use min_so_far=1 to form candidate.

  But note: if we have no non-zero state? Then min_so_far remains BIG? Then we skip.

  Therefore, we can use BIG = K+1.

  Code:

      BIG = K + 1

      for L in range(n,0,-1):
          # j=1
          dp_prev = [0]*n

                  dp_prev[i] = 1
              else:

          if L==1:
              print(n-1)
              return

          # For j from 2 to L:
          for j in range(2, L+1):
              dp_curr = [BIG] * n
              min_so_far = BIG   # minimal value in the prefix for dp_prev

              for i in range(n):
                  # Form candidate from min_so_far?
                  if min_so_far <= K:   # which means we have a valid state in the prefix [0, i-1] that is non-zero
                      candidate = min_so_far * 2 + (1 if S[i]=='1' else 0)

                  else:
                      # we cannot form candidate
                      pass

                  # Update min_so_far: we want to include dp_prev[i] if it is non-zero and <=K? Actually, we stored states that are non-zero? But for j=1, we have zeros? Then we skip zeros?

                  if dp_prev[i] > 0 and dp_prev[i] <= K:
                      if min_so_far == BIG:
                          min_so_far = dp_prev[i]
                      else:
                          min_so_far = min(min_so_far, dp_prev[i])

              # After processing j, set dp_prev to dp_curr for next j
              dp_prev = dp_curr

          # After building j=L, check if any state is <=K?
          for i in range(n):
              if dp_prev[i] <= K:
                  print(n - L)
                  return

      # Since we know L=1 works, we should never get here? 
      print(n-1)   # if we didn't break earlier, but we break at L=1.

But note: we break at L=1 at the beginning? Actually, we don't: we are iterating L from n down to 1. For L=1, we have a separate block that prints n-1 and returns.

  However, we have two blocks for L=1 and L>=2? 

  We can restructure to avoid duplication: we break as soon as we find an L.

  Alternatively, we can do:

      for L in range(n,0,-1):
          if L==1:
              # we know we can form a subsequence of length 1? 
              # Actually, we can: we can leave one digit: either '0' or '1'. 
              print(n-1)
              return

          # Otherwise, we do the DP for j from 1 to L? Actually, we start with j=1 and then j=2..L.

          # But we already have j=1? Then we do j=2..L.

          # Then we check for j=L.

  But we did the j=1 part? Actually, we built j=1 as the base.

  However, note: if L=1, we don't do the j>=2 loop. But we have the j=1 base? Then we break.

  But we don't need to do the j>=2 loop for L=1.

  So the above code structure is acceptable.

But wait: for L=1, we break and output n-1? Actually, the removals is n - L = n-1? That is correct.

  Example: 
      Sample input 1: K=13, S="1100101", n=7.
          We start L=7: 
              j=1: base: dp_prev = [1,1,0,0,1,0,1]  (for each index)
              Then for j=2 to 7: 
                  j=2: 
                      min_so_far = BIG (initially)
                      i=0: 
                          candidate: skip (min_so_far is BIG) -> dp_curr[0]=BIG.
                          update min_so_far: dp_prev[0]=1 -> valid? then min_so_far=1.
                      i=1:
                          candidate = 1*2 + 1 = 3 -> set dp_curr[1]=3.
                          update min_so_far: min(1, dp_prev[1]=1) -> 1.
                      i=2:
                          candidate = 1*2+0=2 -> set dp_curr[2]=2.
                          update min_so_far: min(1, dp_prev[2]=0) -> but we skip zero? So we don't update? Then min_so_far remains 1? 
                          Actually, condition: if dp_prev[2] >0? 0 is not >0 -> skip.
                      i=3: candidate=1*2+0=2 -> set dp_curr[3]=2; then skip update (because dp_prev[3]=0)
                      i=4: candidate=1*2+1=3 -> set dp_curr[4]=3; update: min_so_far = min(1,1)=1? But wait, dp_prev[4]=1 -> valid? Then update to min(1,1)=1.
                      i=5: candidate=1*2+0=2 -> set dp_curr[5]=2; skip update (dp_prev[5]=0)
                      i=6: candidate=1*2+1=3 -> set dp_curr[6]=3; update: min_so_far = min(1,1)=1.

                  Then j=2: dp_curr = [BIG, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]

                  j=3: 
                      min_so_far = BIG
                      i=0: skip candidate; update min_so_far: skip because dp_prev[0]=BIG? Actually, we set dp_prev = dp_curr from j=2: so dp_prev[0]=BIG -> skip? Then min_so_far remains BIG? 
                      i=1: candidate: skip? update: dp_prev[1]=3 -> valid? then min_so_far = 3.
                      i=2: candidate = 3*2+0=6 -> set dp_curr[2]=6; update: min_so_far = min(3,2)=2 (because dp_prev[2]=2 -> valid and 2>0)
                      i=3: candidate=2*2+0=4 -> set; update min_so_far = min(2,2)=2 (dp_prev[3]=2)
                      i=4: candidate=2*2+1=5; set; update min_so_far = min(2,3)=2 (dp_prev[4]=3)
                      i=5: candidate=2*2+0=4; set; update: min_so_far = min(2,2)=2 (dp_prev[5]=2)
                      i=6: candidate=2*2+1=5; set; update: min_so_far = min(2,3)=2.

                  Then j=3: dp_curr = [BIG, BIG, 6,4,5,4,5]

                  j=4: 
                      min_so_far = BIG
                      i0: skip; update: skip (BIG)
                      i1: skip; update: min_so_far=3 (from dp_prev[1]=3? But wait: we set dp_prev = dp_curr from j=3: dp_prev[0]=BIG, dp_prev[1]=BIG? Then i1: dp_prev[1]=BIG -> skip? 
                      Then min_so_far remains BIG until i2: 
                          i2: candidate: skip; update: min_so_far = min(BIG,6) -> but 6>0 and 6<=K? Then min_so_far=6.
                      i3: candidate=6*2+0=12 -> set; update: min_so_far = min(6,4)=4 (because dp_prev[3]=4)
                      i4: candidate=4*2+1=9; set; update: min_so_far = min(4,5)=4
                      i5: candidate=4*2+0=8; set; update: min_so_far = min(4,4)=4
                      i6: candidate=4*2+1=9; set; update: min_so_far = min(4,5)=4.

                  Then j=4: [BIG, BIG, BIG, 12,9,8,9]

                  j=5: 
                      ... we continue.

          We break at L=3? Because after j=4, we have state at i3: 12<=13? Then we check at the end of L=7? Actually, we are building for L=7, so we have to go to j=7? 

          But we break as soon as we find an L that works? Actually, we break the outer L loop only after building the entire j from 2 to L. Then we check: for L=7, we build j=7 and then check? 

          However, we are building for L=7: we are going to build j from 2 to 7. Then at the end, we check: is there any state in j=7 that is <=13? 

          But we know the original number is 101 (which is 5) but we are building a subsequence of length 7? That is the whole string? The whole string is 1100101, which is 101 in decimal? 101>13? Then we skip L=7.

          Then we try L=6: then L=5, then L=4: 

          For L=4: we build j=2,3,4. Then at the end of j=4, we have a state that is 12 (at i3) which is <=13? Then we break and output |S|-4 = 3? 

          But the expected answer is 3? 

          However, the sample output is 3, but we found at L=4? Then removals = 7-4=3.

          But note: we started with L=7, then 6, then 5, then 4? Then we break at L=4? 

          But the minimal removals is 3, which is what we output.

          However, we might find a solution at L=4? Then we output 3 removals.

          But the problem says: minimum removals. We are maximizing L (minimizing removals) and we start from the largest L.

          So we break at the first L (from large to small) that works? That is the maximal L? Then the minimal removals = n - L.

  Therefore, the algorithm is:

      n = len(S)
      BIG = K+1   (a constant)

      # We iterate L from n down to 1:
      for L in range(n, 0, -1):
          # Build base for j=1:
          dp_prev = [0] * n
          for i in range(n):
              if S[i]=='1':
                  dp_prev[i] = 1
              else:
                  dp_prev[i] = 0

          if L==1:
              # We can break immediately: we know we can form a subsequence of length 1.
              print(n-1)
              return

          # Build for j=2 to L:
          # Note: we are going to build j from 2 to L (inclusive) and store the states for j=L in dp_prev.
          for j_lvl in range(2, L+1):
              dp_curr = [BIG] * n
              min_so_far = BIG   # will maintain the minimal value in the prefix of dp_prev (for indices < i) that is non-zero and <=K

              for i in range(n):
                  # Check if we can form a candidate for state (i, j_lvl)
                  if min_so_far <= K:
                      candidate = min_so_far * 2 + (1 if S[i]=='1' else 0)
                      if candidate <= K:
                          dp_curr[i] = candidate
                  # Update min_so_far: with dp_prev[i] (if valid: non-zero and <=K)
                  if dp_prev[i] > 0 and dp_prev[i] <= K:
                      if min_so_far == BIG:
                          min_so_far = dp_prev[i]
                      else:
                          min_so_far = min(min_so_far, dp_prev[i])

              # Prepare for next j_lvl
              dp_prev = dp_curr

          # After building j_lvl = L, check if there is any state that is <=K?
          found = False
          for i in range(n):
              if dp_prev[i] <= K:
                  found = True
                  break

          if found:
              print(n - L)
              return

      # Since we know L=1 always works, we should have returned above. But if not, we output n-1.
      print(n-1)

  Let's test the second sample: K=13, S="1111111" (n=7)
      We start L=7: the whole string is 127, which is >13 -> skip.
      L=6: any subsequence of length 6? The smallest is 111111 = 63? >13 -> skip.
      L=5: 11111 = 31 -> skip.
      L=4: 1111=15 -> skip.
      L=3: 111=7 -> <=13 -> break.

      Then removals = 7-3=4 -> output 4.

  This matches.

  But note: we build for j=2 to L for each L? For L=3: 
      j=1: base: dp_prev = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
      j=2: 
          min_so_far = BIG
          i0: skip candidate; then update min_so_far = 1 -> so min_so_far=1.
          i1: candidate = 1*2+1=3 -> set dp_curr[1]=3; update min_so_far = min(1,1)=1.
          i2: candidate=1*2+1=3; set; update min_so_far=min(1,1)=1.
          ... so dp_curr = [BIG, 3,3,3,3,3,3]
      j=3: 
          min_so_far = BIG
          i0: skip; update: min_so_far = skip? because dp_prev[0]=BIG? 
          i1: skip candidate (min_so_far=BIG); then update: min_so_far = min(BIG, 3)=3.
          i2: candidate = 3*2+1=7 -> set dp_curr[2]=7; update: min_so_far = min(3,3)=3.
          ... then we have states at i2..i6: 7.

      Then at the end, we have a state 7<=13 -> break.

  So we output 7-3=4.

  Therefore, we write the code accordingly.

  But note: we break at the first L (from large to small) that has at least one valid subsequence? That is the maximal L? Then the minimal removals.

  Complexity: O(n^3) which is 60^3 = 216000, acceptable.

  Edge: K=1, S="1" -> n=1.
        L=1: we break and output 0.

  Edge: K=1, S="0" -> but S has no leading zeros? So S cannot be "0"? Actually, the problem says: "S contains no leading zeroes", but "0" is allowed? Actually, the problem says "non-empty" and "no leading zeros". The string "0" is non-empty and has no leading zeros? But note: the problem states that S has no leading zeros, so the first character is not zero? Then S cannot be "0". 

  The input: S is a binary string with no leading zeros, so the first character is '1'. 

  Therefore, we don't have to worry about S starting with '0'.

  But note: we might have a subsequence that is "0" by taking a zero that is not the first? Then we can leave a single zero? 

  Example: K=1, S="10" -> 
      We can remove the first '1' and leave the zero: then we get "0", which is 0<=1 -> then removals = 1.
      How does our algorithm do?
        n=2
        We start L=2: 
            j=1: base: 
                i0: S[0]=='1' -> 1
                i1: S[1]=='0' -> 0
            Then we build j=2: 
                min_so_far = BIG
                i0: skip candidate; update min_so_far: dp_prev[0]=1 -> valid? then min_so_far=1.
                i1: candidate = 1*2+0=2 -> which is >K=1? -> skip. Then dp_curr[1]=BIG.
            Then we check: no state for L=2? Then we go to L=1: 
                break and output 2-1=1.

        Then we output 1.

  But we can also leave a single zero: which is a subsequence of length 1? Then we break at L=1? 

  Actually, we break at L=1: we output 1? That is correct.

  However, we break at L=1 only if we don't find for L>=2? But we did not find for L=2, so we go to L=1.

  But note: we have two possibilities for L=1: 
        We can leave the '1' (value 1) or the '0' (value 0). Both are <=1? Then we break at L=1 and output 1.

  So the algorithm is correct.

  Code implementation note: we use BIG = K+1.

  Let's code accordingly.

  But note: the problem constraints: K up to 2^60, so we must use integers that can handle that? In Python, integers are arbitrary, but we are doing comparisons and multiplications? 

  However, candidate = min_so_far * 2 + bit: min_so_far is at most K (if we set it from states that are <=K) then candidate is at most 2*K+1. Since K<=2^60, then 2*K+1 <= 2^61, which is within Python integers? 

  But the problem says time 0.5s and memory 256MB? We are using O(n) memory per j, and we are iterating j from 2 to L, but we reuse the arrays. So memory is O(n). 

  But we are iterating L from n down to 1? Then we do at most n iterations? Then worst-case total operations: O(n^3) as explained.

  We write the code accordingly.

  However, we must be cautious: if L is large and we break early, we don't do the entire n iterations? 

  But worst-case we do L from n down to 1, and each L we do O(L*n) operations? Then worst-case total O(n^3). For n=60, 60^3=216000, which is acceptable.

  We output the answer as n - L.

  Let's run the sample inputs.

  Sample 1: K=13, S="1100101", n=7 -> output 3.
  Sample 2: K=13, S="1111111", n=7 -> output 4.

  We write the code accordingly.

  But note: we break at the first L (largest L) that works? 

  We are iterating L from n down to 1: so we start with the largest L. We break as soon as we find one.

  This is correct.

  Code:

      K = int(input().strip())
      S = input().strip()
      n = len(S)
      BIG = K + 1   # any number above K

      # Iterate L from n down to 1
      for L in range(n, 0, -1):
          # Build base state for j=1: 
          dp_prev = [0] * n
          for i in range(n):
              if S[i] == '1':
                  dp_prev[i] = 1
              else:
                  dp_prev[i] = 0

          if L == 1:
              # Always possible: we output removals = n - L = n-1
              print(n - 1)
              return

          # We are going to build for j from 2 to L
          # Note: we are going to build j=2,3,...,L (so j_lvl from 2 to L, inclusive)
          for j in range(2, L+1):
              dp_curr = [BIG] * n
              min_so_far = BIG   # the minimal value in the prefix of dp_prev (for indices < i) that is non-zero and <=K

              for i in range(n):
                  # Check if we can form a candidate for state (i, j)
                  if min_so_far <= K:
                      bit = 1 if S[i]=='1' else 0
                      candidate = min_so_far * 2 + bit
                      if candidate <= K:
                          dp_curr[i] = candidate

                  # Update min_so_far with dp_prev[i] if it is non-zero and <=K
                  if dp_prev[i] > 0 and dp_prev[i] <= K:
                      if min_so_far == BIG:
                          min_so_far = dp_prev[i]
                      else:
                          min_so_far = min(min_so_far, dp_prev[i])

              # Set dp_prev to dp_curr for the next j
              dp_prev = dp_curr

          # After building for j from 1 to L (we built j=1 then j=2..L, so now dp_prev is for j=L)
          found = False
          for i in range(n):
              if dp_prev[i] <= K:
                  found = True
                  break

          if found:
              print(n - L)
              return

      # If we get here, then we break at L=1? But we should not get here.
      print(n-1)

But note: we break at L=1 in the if L==1 block. So we don't need the last print? 

  Actually, the loop for L in [n, n-1, ... , 1] includes L=1? Then we have a block for L=1 that breaks.

  Therefore, we can remove the last print.

  However, we can also note: the L=1 block is inside the loop? 

  We do:

      for L in ...:
          if L==1: ... and break.

  So we are safe.

  But note: we break the function in the L=1 block and also in the found block? 

  This is acceptable.

  Let me run with a small example: n=1, S="1", K=1.

      L=1: 
          we enter the L==1 block: output n-1 = 0.

  Correct.

  Example: n=1, S="1", K=0 -> but K>=1 per input? So we don't worry.

  We are done.

  However, note: we update min_so_far even when the state at i is BIG? 

      In the update: 
          if dp_prev[i] > 0 and dp_prev[i] <= K: 

      But if dp_prev[i] is BIG, then it is >K? So we skip.

  So it's safe.

  We'll submit the code accordingly.

  But note: the problem constraints: n<=60, and K up to 2^60. We use integers that can hold up to 2*K+1? That is 2^(61) which is about 2e18, which is acceptable in Python? (Python integers are arbitrary, but we do arithmetic on numbers that are about 2^61, which is about 2e18, which is acceptable).

  We run the sample inputs.

  Sample 1: 
      K=13, S="1100101"
      We break at L=4? Then output 3.

  But note: the example in the problem: 
      We remove 3 bits to get "1101" (which is 13) -> so L=4? Then removals=3.

  However, we built L=4? How? 
      We start L=7: skip.
      L=6: skip.
      L=5: skip.
      L=4: we build j=2,3,4 and then we find a state that is <=13? 

      In j=4: we built a state at i=3 (the fourth character? indices 0-indexed) that is 12? 

      How did we get 12? 
          j=4: 
             ... we had at j=3: 
                 ... we had at j=2: 
                     i1: 3 (from 1 and 1 -> 1*2+1=3)
                 then j=3: 
                     i3: we have min_so_far= min(3, ...) then at i3: candidate = 3*2+0=6? 
                 then j=4: 
                     at i3: we have min_so_far = 6? then candidate = 6*2+0=12? 

      The subsequence: 
          j=2: we take indices0 and1: "11" -> 3
          j=3: we take indices0,1,3: but wait, the third character (index2) is skipped? Then we have "110" at indices0,1,3? -> 110? which is 6? 
          j=4: then we take indices0,1,3, and then the next? But we are at index3? Then we take index3 again? 

      Actually, we are building the subsequence by taking the bits in order. The state at j=4 at index3: we are taking the first two bits (index0,1) then the bit at index3? But then we have "11" and then the third bit (index2) is skipped, then we take the fourth bit (index3) -> that gives "11" and then "0" at index3? Then we have "110", which is 6? Then we extend to 6 at index3? Then we get 6? Then for j=4, we extend at index? 

      Actually, we are at index3? Then we are taking the first two bits (index0,1) then the bit at index3? Then we have a three-bit subsequence? Then we extend at a later index? 

      How do we get 12? 
          We have: at j=3 we had a state at index3 (the fourth character) with value 6? Then at j=4, we are at index3? But we cannot take the same index twice? 

      Actually, we are iterating i and we are building the state at index i for the current j. The state at index i uses a subsequence that ends at i. 

      For j=4 at index3: we are forming a subsequence of length 4 ending at index3? That would be: 
          We take a subsequence of length 3 that ends at an index k < 3? Then we append the bit at index3? 

      In j=3, we had states at indices1,2,3,4,5,6? So we can use any state at index k<3? 

      The minimal value in the prefix [0,2] for j=3? 
          At j=3: 
              state at index0: BIG? 
              state at index1: BIG? 
              state at index2: 6? (from the first two indices: 1,1 and then the bit at index2? but wait: index2 is the third character: '0'. Then we have "110" -> 6? 
          Then min_so_far for the prefix [0,2] is 6? 

      Then at i=3: candidate = 6*2 + (S[3]=='0'?0) = 12.

      The subsequence: the first three bits (indices0,1,2) and then the fourth bit? But the fourth bit is at index3? So we take indices0,1,2,3: "1100" -> which is 12? 

      But the problem states: remove the 3rd,5th,6th bits? 
          The bits: 
            0: '1'
            1: '1'
            2: '0' -> third bit? we remove? 
            3: '0' -> we remove? 
            4: '1'
            5: '0' -> remove
            6: '1'

          We remove indices2,3,5 -> then we have indices0,1,4,6: "1101" -> which is 13? 

      How do we get 12? 

      Actually, we have two solutions: 
          Solution1: remove 3 bits to get 13? 
          Solution2: remove 3 bits to get 12? 

      But the problem says: minimum removals is 3. We found a solution at L=4? Then we break? 

      However, we found a solution at L=4 (which is 12) and output removals=3? 

      But the problem says the minimal removals is 3? 

      We don't care which solution we found? 

      However, the problem states: the sample output is 3.

      But note: we are not required to output the subsequence, only the removals.

      So our algorithm outputs 3 for sample1? 

      But the problem says the answer is 3? 

      So it's correct.

      However, the sample explanation uses 13? We found 12? 

      Why didn't we find 13? 
          At L=4: 
              We also build the subsequence that becomes 13? 
              How? 
                  We take the first two bits: '1','1' -> then skip the next two zeros? then take the '1' at index4 and the last '1' at index6: that yields "1101" at indices0,1,4,6 -> which is 13.

          How do we build that in our dp?
              j=1: at index0: 1; index1:1; index4:1; index6:1.
              j=2: 
                 at index1: from k0: 1 -> 1*2+1=3
                 at index4: min_so_far = 1 -> 1*2+1=3? 
                 at index6: 1*2+1=3? 
              j=3: 
                 at index4: from k1 (index1): 3*2+1=7? 
                 at index6: from k1: 3*2+1=7? 
              j=4: 
                 at index6: from k4 (index4): 7*2+1=15? -> which is >13? 
                 but we also have other states: for j=3 at index4: we might also have extended from k0? 
                     Actually, we can extend from any k<4? 
                     We have k0: state at j=1: 1 -> then at j=2: we extend to index4? then we get 1*2+1=3? 
                     Then at j=3: we extend from index4: but we are building state at j=3 at index4? How? 
                         j=3: 
                             i=4: 
                                 min_so_far: the minimal value in the prefix [0,3] for j=2? 
                                 We have at index0: 1 -> min_so_far=1
                                 then at index1: min_so_far=min(1,3)=1? 
                                 then at index2: min_so_far=min(1,2) -> but we didn't compute state at index2? 
                                 Actually, we did: at index2: j=2: we had 2? 
                                 Then min_so_far at index4: min(1,3,2)=1? 
                                 Then candidate = 1*2+1=3? 
                         So we set dp_prev[4] for j=3 to 3? 

                 Then at j=4: 
                     at index6: 
                         min_so_far: minimal value in the prefix [0,5] for j=3? 
                         We have states: 
                             index0: BIG? 
                             index1: BIG? 
                             index2: 6? 
                             index3: 4? 
                             index4: 3? 
                             index5: 4? 
                         Then min_so_far = min(6,4,3,4)=3? 
                         candidate = 3*2+1=7? 

                 But wait, we want to build the subsequence: indices0,1,4,6: 
                     j=1: index0: 1
                     j=2: index1: 1 -> then state at index1: 3
                     j=3: we skip index2 and index3, then at index4: we use state at index1: 3 -> then state at index4: 3*2+1=7? 
                     Then j=4: at index6: we use state at index4: 7 -> 7*2+1=15? 

                 How do we get 13? 

                 Actually, the subsequence "1101" is: 
                     The bits: 
                         index0: '1' -> 1
                         index1: '1' -> then we have 1*2+1 = 3
                         skip index2 and index3 (zeros) 
                         index4: '1' -> then 3*2+1=7
                         skip index5 (zero)
                         index6: '1' -> 7*2+1=15? 

                 But wait: the value of "1101" is 8+4+0+1 = 13? 

                 How do we represent the subsequence? 
                     The subsequence: 
                         position0: 1 -> 1
                         position1: 1 -> then the number becomes 11 (binary) = 3
                         position4: 1 -> then the number becomes 111 (binary) = 7? 
                         position6: 1 -> then 1111 = 15? 

                 But we want 1101: which is 1,1,0,1? 

                 How do we get the 0? 

                 Actually, we didn't take the zero? 

                 The subsequence we built: indices0,1,4,6: the bits: S[0]='1', S[1]='1', S[4]='1', S[6]='1' -> "1111"=15.

                 To get "1101", we need to take the zero? 

                 How: 
                    j=1: index0: 1
                    j=2: index1: 3
                    j=3: we need to take a zero? at index2 or index3? 
                         at index2: 
                             min_so_far = 1 (from index0) -> candidate = 1*2+0=2? 
                         then j=4: at index6: 
                             min_so_far = min( states for j=3: which include 2 (at index2), 3 (at index1) -> then min_so_far=2? 
                             candidate = 2*2+1=5? 

                 How do we get 13? 

                 We have to take: 
                    index0: 1
                    index1: 1 -> then we have 11 (binary) = 3
                    skip index2
                    index3: 0? -> then we have 110 (binary)=6? 
                    skip index4
                    skip index5
                    index6: 1? -> then 1101 = 13.

                 How do we build that?

                 j=1: index0: 1
                 j=2: index1: 1 -> 3
                 j=3: index3: 0 -> but wait, we cannot form a three-digit number that starts with 1? But we have a two-digit number (at index1:3) and then we append a zero: 3*2+0=6 -> state at index3:6.
                 j=4: index6: from state at index3 (6) -> 6*2+1=13.

                 Then at j=4, we have a state at index6:13, which is <=13? Then we break.

                 How do we get that in our dp? 
                    j=3: 
                         ... at index3: 
                             min_so_far: minimal value in the prefix [0,2] for j=2: 
                                 states: 
                                     index0: BIG? (if we didn't extend the state from index0 to j=2? 
                                 Actually, at j=2: 
                                     index0: we didn't form? Because we started min_so_far as BIG? Then at index0: skip candidate; then update min_so_far: if dp_prev[0] (for j=1) is 1 -> then min_so_far=1.
                                     index1: candidate = 1*2+1=3 -> set; update min_so_far=min(1,1)=1.
                                     index2: candidate = 1*2+0=2 -> set; update: skip? because dp_prev[2] for j=1 is 0? -> we skip? Then min_so_far remains 1? 
                                     index3: candidate = 1*2+0=2 -> set; update: skip? 
                                 But wait, we are building j=2: 
                                     dp_curr[0]=BIG (because we skipped at i0: candidate skipped? Then we didn't set? Actually, we set at i0: we skipped candidate? Then we set to BIG? 
                                     Then update min_so_far: at i0: we update min_so_far = 1 (from dp_prev[0]=1) -> then at i1: candidate = 1*2+1=3 -> set dp_curr[1]=3; then update min_so_far = min(1,1)=1.
                                     Then at i2: candidate = 1*2+0=2 -> set dp_curr[2]=2; then update: skip because dp_prev[2]=0? 
                                     Then at i3: candidate = 1*2+0=2 -> set dp_curr[3]=2; then update: skip because dp_prev[3]=0? 

                         So for j=2: 
                             dp_curr = [BIG, 3, 2, 2]

                    Then j=3: 
                         min_so_far = BIG
                         i0: skip; update: min_so_far = BIG (because dp_prev[0]=BIG -> skip) 
                         i1: skip; update: min_so_far = min(BIG,3)=3? 
                         i2: skip; update: min_so_far = min(3,2)=2? 
                         i3: skip; update: min_so_far = min(2,2)=2? 
                         Then we have no candidate for j=3? 

                 But wait, we didn't build the state for j=3 at index3? 
                     We require: 
                         candidate = min_so_far * 2 + (S[3]=='0'?0) 
                         at i3: min_so_far=2? then candidate=4+0=4? -> set dp_curr[3]=4? 

                 Then j=4: 
                     at index6: 
                         min_so_far: minimal value in the prefix [0,5] for j=3: 
                             states: 
                                 i0: BIG
                                 i1: BIG? 
                                 i2: BIG? 
                                 i3: 4? 
                                 i4: ? (we didn't compute for i4 in j=3? 
                         Actually, we only built at j=3: 
                             i0: BIG
                             i1: BIG? 
                             i2: BIG? 
                             i3: 4? 
                         Then min_so_far for the prefix [0,5] at j=3: minimal is 4? 
                         Then at index6: candidate = 4*2+1=9? 

                 How do we get 13? 

                 We need to extend from the state at index3 (which is 6? from j=3) -> but we didn't build 6? 

                 Why? 

                 In j=3: 
                     We built at index3: 4? 
                 But the state we want: 
                     The subsequence: indices0,1,3: 
                         j=1: index0: 1
                         j=2: index1: 3
                         j=3: index3: 3*2+0=6? 

                 How do we get that state? 
                     In j=3: 
                         at index3: 
                             min_so_far: minimal value in the prefix [0,2] for j=2: 
                                 states: 
                                     index0: BIG? 
                                     index1: 3
                                     index2: 2
                                 min_so_far = 2? (if we update min_so_far by the time we get to index3? 
                                 But we update min_so_far as we iterate i? 
                                 At i0: min_so_far = BIG -> then update: skip because dp_prev[0]=BIG? 
                                 Then at i1: 
                                     candidate: skip? -> no, because min_so_far is BIG? 
                                     then update: min_so_far = min(BIG, 3)=3? 
                                 Then at i2: 
                                     candidate: min_so_far=3 -> 3*2+0=6? -> set dp_curr[2]=6? 
                                     update: min_so_far = min(3,2)=2? 
                                 Then at i3: 
                                     candidate = 2*2+0=4? -> set dp_curr[3]=4? 

                         So we have two states: at index2:6 and index3:4.

                 Then for j=4: 
                     at index6: 
                         min_so_far = min( states in prefix [0,5] for j=3: which are 6 and 4? ) = 4? 
                         candidate = 4*2+1=9? 

                 But we also have state at index2:6? Then min_so_far at index6 should be 4? Then we get 9? 

                 How do we get 13? 
                     We need to extend the state at index3 (which is 6) to index6: 6*2+1=13? 

                 How do we use the state 6 at index2 in j=4? 
                     We are at index6: 
                         min_so_far = min( states in the prefix [0,5] for j=3: including the state at index2:6, and index3:4) -> min_so_far=4? 
                     Then we form candidate=4*2+1=9, and we also could form candidate=6*2+1=13? 

                 But our algorithm only stores the minimal value for the entire prefix? Then we only form the minimal candidate? 

                 However, we don't care as long as one candidate is <=K? 

                 But we are storing the minimal candidate? Then we set dp_curr[6]=9? 

                 Then we miss 13? 

                 But 13 is also <=13? 

                 The problem: we are storing the minimal candidate? But we want to know if there is any candidate that is <=K? 

                 However, we only store the minimal candidate? Then if 9 is <=K, we know there is one? But if there is a candidate that is 13, which is also <=K, we don't need it? 

                 But we don't need it? We only care if there is at least one? 

                 However, we break as soon as we have at least one state at j=L that is <=K? 

                 But in this case, we have 9 at index6? Then we break? 

                 But we also have 13? But we didn't store it? 

                 This is a problem.

  What went wrong? 

  We assumed that by storing the minimal value for the state at i we can form the minimal candidate? And then we can use that for extending? 

  But for existence, we don't need the minimal candidate? We need to know if there is any candidate that is <=K? 

  But we are storing only the minimal candidate? Then if the minimal candidate is <=K, we know we have one. But if the minimal candidate is >K, but there is a larger candidate that is <=K, we miss it? 

  Example: 
      K=13, we have two candidates: 9 and 13. 
      We store 9? Then we break? 

  But then we break and output 3 removals? which is correct.

  However, what if the minimal candidate is >K, but there is a candidate that is <=K? 
      Example: 
          We have two candidates: 14 and 13. 
          We store 14 (the minimal candidate) and 13 (which we don't store). Then we see 14>K? Then we fail? 

  This is a flaw.

  We must store: for each i, the minimal value that is <=K? But we are already storing the minimal value? 

  But if we have two candidates: 14 and 13, and we store 14? Then we see 14>K? Then we fail? 

  How can we avoid? 

  We should not restrict to the minimal candidate? We want to know: is there a candidate that is <=K? 

  We can store for each i the existence of a candidate that is <=K? But then we lose the value for extending? 

  Alternatively, we can store for each i the minimal value that is <=K? But then if we have a candidate that is 13, we store 13? 

  But then we would have stored 13? 

  In the above example: 
      j=4: at index6: 
          candidate1: from state at index2 (value=6): 6*2+1=13
          candidate2: from state at index3 (value=4): 4*2+1=9
          Then the minimal candidate is 9? 

      Then we store 9? 

      Then we know we have a candidate that is <=K (because 9<=13) and we break? 

  So we break? 

  But what if we have only candidate 13? 
      Then we store 13? 
      Then we break? 

  But what if we have two candidates: 14 and 13? 
      The minimal candidate is 13? which is <=13? Then we store 13? 

  But what if we have two candidates: 15 and 13? 
      The minimal candidate is 13? Then we store 13? 

  Therefore, storing the minimal candidate that is achievable (which might be above K, then we store BIG) is sufficient for existence: because if the minimal candidate is <=K, then we have one; if not, we don't.

  But note: we might have a candidate that is not minimal but is <=K? 
      Example: 
          candidates: 14, 13 -> the minimal candidate is 13? which is <=13? Then we store 13? 
          candidates: 13, 14 -> we store 13? 
          candidates: 12, 15 -> we store 12? 

  So we are safe.

  But in the example above with the subsequence "1101"=13 and "1111"=15: 
      We also had a candidate 9? Then we store 9? which is <=13, so we break? 

  And we break and output 3 removals? which is correct.

  Therefore, the algorithm is correct.

  Final code:

      K = int(input().strip())
      S = input().strip()
      n = len(S)
      BIG = K + 1   # any number > K

      # Iterate L from n down to 1:
      for L in range(n, 0, -1):
          # base for j=1
          dp_prev = [0] * n
          for i in range(n):
              if S[i] == '1':
                  dp_prev[i] = 1
              else:
                  dp_prev[i] = 0

          if L == 1:
              print(n-1)
              return

          for j in range(2, L+1):
              dp_curr = [BIG] * n
              min_so_far = BIG   # minimal value in dp_prev for indices < i, that is non-zero and <=K

              for i in range(n):
                  # Try to form candidate for (i,j)
                  if min_so_far <= K:
                      bit = 1 if S[i]=='1' else 0
                      candidate = min_so_far * 2 + bit
                      if candidate <= K:
                          dp_curr[i] = candidate
                      # else: leave as BIG
                  # If we have a valid state at i for the previous j, update min_so_far.
                  if dp_prev[i] > 0 and dp_prev[i] <= K:
                      if min_so_far == BIG:
                          min_so_far = dp_prev[i]
                      else:
                          if dp_prev[i] < min_so_far:
                              min_so_far = dp_prev[i]

              # end for i
              dp_prev = dp_curr   # move to next j

          # After building j = L, check existence
          for i in range(n):
              if dp_prev[i] <= K:
                  print(n - L)
                  return

      # We should not reach here.
      print(n-1)

  We submit.

  But note: the condition for updating min_so_far: 
      if dp_prev[i] > 0 and dp_prev[i] <= K: 
          update

  We do this after we have used min_so_far for the current i? 

  This is because for the next i (i+1), we want to include the state at i.

  This is correct.

  Let's hope it passes.
