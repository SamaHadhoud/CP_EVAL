 We are given K (which can be up to 2^60) and a binary string S (length up to 60)
 We are to remove the minimum number of bits such that the remaining subsequence (without changing order) forms a binary number without leading zeros and <= K.

 Approach:
 We try to find the longest subsequence (starting from the longest possible, which is n, then n-1, ...) that forms a binary number <= K and without leading zeros.

 However note: the entire string might be too long? But note |S| <= 60, but 2^60 is about 1e18 which is around the maximum of K (which is 2^60). So we have to be cautious.

 Steps:
 1. We try L = n, n-1, ... until we find a subsequence of length L that is <= K and without leading zeros.

 How to check for a fixed L?
  We can use dynamic programming: 
    Let dp[j][i] = the minimal decimal value (or if the value exceeds K we don't care, so we can set to a big number) 
    for a subsequence of length j ending at index i (in the original string).

  However, note: we want to avoid leading zeros. So the subsequence must start with '1'. 

  But note: what if L=1? then we can have '0'? 
      The problem: the resulting binary string must not contain any leading zeros. 
      But a single '0' is allowed? Actually the problem says "non-empty sequence", and without leading zeros: so a single zero is acceptable? 
      However note: the problem states: "A binary string is a non-empty sequence of 0’s and 1’s", and "contains no leading zeroes" meaning that the string "0" is not allowed? 
      But wait: the input S has no leading zeros, but the subsequence must also not have leading zeros.

  Interpretation: 
      The problem says: "The resulting binary string also must not contain any leading zeroes." 
      This means that if the resulting string is "0", that would be invalid? Actually, the string "0" has no leading zero? It is just one zero. 
      However, the problem states that the input S has no leading zeros and is non-empty. 

  Clarification: 
      In the context of binary numbers, a single zero is acceptable? But note: the problem says "no leading zeros", and a single zero does not have a leading zero? 
      Actually, the problem says "contains no leading zeroes": so a string that is "0" is acceptable? 

  However, note the sample: if K=1, and S="0", then we cannot have "0" because 0<=1? But the input S has no leading zeros and is non-empty, so S won't be "0"?
      Actually, the input condition: S contains no leading zeros -> so S cannot be "0" because that would be a single zero? 
      But wait: the problem says "Ayu has a favorite binary string S which contains no leading zeroes." -> so if the string is "0", that has no leading zero? 
      However, typically "0" is considered without leading zeros. But note: the problem says "non-empty" and "no leading zeros", so "0" is allowed? 

  But the input condition: the binary string S is given without leading zeros. So if the string is "0", that is acceptable? 

  However, the problem states: "You may safely assume S contains no leading zeroes." -> meaning that the first character is either '1' or if the string is of length 1 then it can be '0'? 
      Actually, no: because if the string is "0", that is the only representation. But the problem says "no leading zeros" and "0" is not considered to have a leading zero? 

  But note: the problem says the resulting binary string must not contain any leading zeros. So if we leave a subsequence that starts with '0', then that is invalid? 
      Unless the entire subsequence is "0", because then it is a single zero. But if we leave a subsequence that is "01", that is invalid because of the leading zero.

  Therefore, the subsequence we form must either be:
      - A single '0', or 
      - A string that starts with '1' and then any bits.

  However, note: if we have a subsequence that starts with '0' and has more than one character, that is invalid.

  But observe: if we have a subsequence of length L>=2 and the first character is '0', then it has a leading zero -> invalid.

  Therefore, we must ensure:
      - If the subsequence has length 1 and the bit is '0', that is valid.
      - If the subsequence has length>=2, then the first character must be '1'.

  How do we enforce that?
      We can do:
          For L=1: we can take any bit? Actually, we can take a '0' or '1'. But note: if we take a '0', then the value is 0, which is <=K (since K>=1) -> valid.
          For L>=2: we must start with a '1'. So when building the subsequence, the first character must be '1'.

  However, in our DP we are building from left to right. We can do:

  We'll iterate from the beginning to the end. For a fixed length j (the subsequence length we are building):

      For j=1:
          dp[i] = 0 if S[i]=='0', 1 if S[i]=='1'. But note: we are going to use this to build j=2, and for j=2 we must have started with a '1'. So if we have a subsequence of length 2, we can only extend from a j=1 that started with a non-zero? Actually, we cannot extend from a zero? because then we would have a leading zero? 

      Actually, the DP state does not record the entire string, so we have to avoid building an invalid sequence.

      We can design:
          For j=1: 
             if S[i]=='0', then we have the value 0.
             if S[i]=='1', then we have the value 1.

          For j>=2:
             We extend from a subsequence of length j-1 that ended at an index k (k < i). But note: if the subsequence of length j-1 has a value of 0, then if we append a bit, we get 0*2 + bit = bit -> but that would be a subsequence that effectively starts at the new bit? However, that is not the case: we are building the entire subsequence.

      Actually, the issue is: the entire subsequence must not have leading zeros. So the first character must be '1' for j>=2. Therefore, we can only start with a '1'. 

      How to enforce? 
          We can do: 
            For j=1: we allow any single bit (including '0').
            For j>=2: we only consider subsequences that start with a '1'. Therefore, when we extend a subsequence of length j-1, that subsequence must have started with a '1'. But note: if we have a subsequence of length j-1 that has value 0, then we cannot extend it? Actually, that subsequence of length j-1 must be entirely zeros? But that is impossible because it would have to start with a zero? and then we are going to add a new bit? but then the new sequence would start with a zero? -> invalid.

      Therefore, for j>=2, we only extend from a state that has a non-zero value? Actually, not exactly: we require the entire sequence to not have leading zeros. The entire sequence we are building must have the first character as '1'. 

      How do we know the first character? 
          We don't store the entire sequence. But note: the value of the subsequence of length j-1 must be at least 1? Because if the first character is '1', then the value is at least 1.

      Therefore, we can do:
          For j=1: we store the value at each position.
          For j>=2: 
             We traverse i from 0 to n-1, and we consider that we are going to append S[i] to a subsequence of length j-1 that ended at an index k < i. But note: the value of the subsequence of length j-1 must be at least 1? Actually, if the subsequence of length j-1 is "10", that is valid and its value is 2, then we can append a '1' to get "101" = 5. 

      However, what if we have a subsequence of length j-1 that started with a '0'? That is impossible because we enforce that for j>=2 we don't form a subsequence that has a leading zero? Actually, we never form such because our j=1 state for a '0' is 0, and then when we extend from a 0 we get a new value: 0*2 + (bit) -> which is 0 or 1. But then that new sequence would be of the form: [some zeros and then the new bit]. However, the entire sequence we are building must start with a '1'. So we must avoid sequences that start with a zero? 

      How to avoid? 
          We can note: the first character of the entire subsequence must be '1'. Therefore, we require that the first character we pick must be at an index i0 such that S[i0]=='1'. 

      Therefore, in our DP for j>=2, we only consider states that have non-zero value? Actually, if we have a sequence of zeros then the value is zero, and then we are building a sequence that starts with zeros? -> invalid.

      However, note: we are building the entire sequence from left to right. We can enforce: 
          For j>=2, we only extend from a state (j-1) that has a positive value? Because if the state has a positive value, then the sequence must have started with a '1'. 

      Why? 
          Because a binary number that is positive and without leading zeros must start with '1'. 

      But note: what if we have a state of j-1 that is 0? Then we cannot extend? Actually, we should not extend because that would form a sequence that starts with a '0' (the first character of the j-1 part is '0') and then we append? Then the entire sequence would start with '0'. So we do not want to extend from a zero state for j>=2.

      Therefore, we can do:
          For j>=2, we only consider extending from states that are non-zero (and then we know they started with '1'). 

      However, note: what if we have a state that is non-zero but actually started with a '1'? That is the only possibility for non-zero? Actually, yes: a non-zero value for a binary string without leading zeros must start with '1'. 

      But wait: what about a state that is non-zero but we built it from a subsequence that started with a '1'? Then we are safe.

      Therefore, in the DP for j>=2, we only extend from states that have a value in the range [1, K] (so non-zero and <=K).

      However, note: we also have the possibility of having a subsequence that is entirely zeros? Then we would have a state of 0. But we skip those for j>=2? That is correct: because we don't want to form a sequence that has a leading zero (unless it is a single zero).

  Algorithm for fixed L (from n down to 1):
      dp_prev[i] = value of the subsequence of length (j-1) ending at i, for the current j we are building. We start with j=1.

      Steps:
        Let dp0 = [values for j=1]

        For j from 2 to L:
          dp_curr = [BIG] * n   # we initialize with a big number (like K+1) meaning invalid or too big.
          We also want to maintain the minimal value for the previous state (j-1) for indices less than i? 

          How to update? 
            For each position i (from 0 to n-1), we want to consider all k in [0, i-1] such that the subsequence of length j-1 ending at k is valid (non-zero and <=K) and then we append S[i].

            The new value = dp_prev[k] * 2 + (1 if S[i]=='1' else 0)

          But note: we have to avoid building numbers that exceed K. So if the new value is > K, we skip.

          However, we don't have to store every possible value? We want to know: for a fixed j and ending at i, what is the minimal value? Why minimal? Because we want to know if there's at least one valid value? Actually, we want to check if there's any valid value? But note: if we have multiple ways to form a subsequence of length j ending at i, we want to keep the minimal value to have more chances to extend? 

          Actually, we want to keep the minimal value for each state (j, i) so that we can extend it to j+1 without exceeding K. 

          How to compute without iterating over every k? 
            We can do: 
              Let min_so_far = a very big number (like K+1) 
              Traverse i from 0 to n-1, and for each i:
                  We consider all k from 0 to i-1: but we can maintain min_so_far as the minimal value of dp_prev for k in [0, i-1] that are valid (non-zero and <=K). Then:
                    candidate = min_so_far * 2 + (1 if S[i]=='1' else 0)
                    if candidate <= K, then we set dp_curr[i] = candidate.

                  Then update min_so_far for the current index i? Actually, we are at j-1 state for the current i? But note: we are building j from j-1, and we are iterating i. We can update min_so_far with dp_prev[i] at the current i? But note: for the next positions (i+1, ...) we can use the value at i? 

          However, note: we require k < i. So when we are at i, we have processed all indices < i? Then we can update min_so_far with dp_prev[i] at the end of the inner loop? But no: because we are processing dp_curr[i] using min_so_far that includes indices from 0 to i-1. Then after processing i, we update min_so_far with dp_prev[i] so that for the next i+1 we have the updated min_so_far.

          But note: we are building j (current) and we are iterating i. For the state j, we are going to use the previous state j-1 (dp_prev) for indices < i. Therefore, we update min_so_far after we use it for the current i? 

          Actually, we do:
            for i in range(0, n):
                if min_so_far is not BIG (meaning we have seen at least one valid state for j-1 from indices < i) then:
                    candidate = min_so_far * 2 + (1 if S[i]=='1' else 0)
                    if candidate <= K: then we set dp_curr[i] = candidate

                Then, we update min_so_far with dp_prev[i] (if dp_prev[i] is valid and non-zero? Actually, we are building j>=2, so we require non-zero? But note: our dp_prev for j-1 might include zeros? We skip zeros for j>=2? Actually, in our dp_prev for j-1, we have stored values for j-1. But for j>=2, the state j-1 must have started with a '1'? How do we enforce that? 

          How we built j=1? 
             j=1: we stored 0 for '0' and 1 for '1'. Then for j=2, we only want to extend from the state that has value>=1? So we should not extend from a state that has value 0? 

          Therefore, in the update for min_so_far, we skip dp_prev[i] if it is 0? Actually, no: because we have stored 0 for a '0' in j=1. Then for j=2, we don't want to use that 0? 

          How about: for j>=2, we only consider states that have value in the range [1, K]? 

          So in the min_so_far update: we update min_so_far only if dp_prev[i] is in the range [1, K]? 

          But note: what if we have multiple states? We want the minimal value? Actually, we want the minimal value that is valid? 

          However, note: the minimal value in the previous state is best for extending? Because then candidate = min_so_far * 2 + bit is minimized.

          Therefore, we do:
            min_so_far = BIG
            for i in range(0, n):
                # Check if we can form a state for j ending at i
                if min_so_far != BIG:   # meaning we have at least one valid state from the previous state for indices < i
                    candidate = min_so_far * 2 + (1 if S[i]=='1' else 0)
                    if candidate <= K:
                        dp_curr[i] = candidate

                # Now update min_so_far for the next i: with the state at i of the previous dp (dp_prev[i])
                if dp_prev[i] != BIG and dp_prev[i] <= K and dp_prev[i] != 0:   # we skip zeros for j>=2? But note: j-1 might be 1? Actually, j>=2 so j-1>=1. And for j-1=1, we have stored 0 for a '0'. But we don't want to extend from 0. So we skip if dp_prev[i]==0? 
                    # Actually, we can skip any state that is 0? But note: j-1 might be 1 and we have a state 0, then we don't want to extend that for j=2? -> correct.
                    if min_so_far == BIG:
                        min_so_far = dp_prev[i]
                    else:
                        if dp_prev[i] < min_so_far:
                            min_so_far = dp_prev[i]

          However, note: what if we have multiple states at the same index? We are storing per index the minimal value? Actually, per index we store one value: the minimal value for a subsequence of length j-1 ending at i.

          But note: we are building the minimal value at each index? That is the goal: we want the minimal value for each state so we can extend.

          But wait: is minimal always best? Yes, because we are going to multiply by 2 and add a bit, so a smaller value leads to a smaller next value.

      After building dp_curr for j, we set dp_prev = dp_curr and then move to j+1.

      Then, after building for j=L, we check if there exists any i such that dp_prev[i] <= K? Then we can form a subsequence of length L -> then the answer is n - L.

  We iterate L from n down to 1, and we break as soon as we find an L for which there exists a valid subsequence.

  Special note: 
      What if we cannot form a subsequence of length 1? 
          Actually, we can always form a subsequence of length 1: because we can take any single bit? 
          But note: if we take a '0', that is valid? The problem says the resulting binary string must not contain leading zeros -> a single zero is acceptable? 
          And K>=1, so 0<=K -> valid.

      Therefore, the worst-case minimal removal is n-1.

  Steps in the main loop:

      for L in range(n, 0, -1):
          # We try to build a subsequence of length L

          # Step 1: j=1
          dp_prev = array of length n: 
             for each i: 
                 if S[i]=='0': value=0
                 else: value=1

          # If L==1, then we check: any value in dp_prev is <=K? 
             Actually, 0<=K and 1<=K? yes, because K>=1. So we can always have L=1? 
             Then we would output n-1? 

          But note: we are iterating from L=n down to 1. We break at the first L that works.

          However, we want the longest subsequence? because we want the minimal removals = n - L, and we want the maximal L such that there exists a subsequence of length L that is valid.

          Therefore, we iterate L from n down to 1 and the first L we find that has a valid subsequence we output n-L.

          But note: we must consider that for L=1 we are always valid? So the worst-case we output n-1.

      How about the entire string? 
          If the entire string is valid? Then we break at L=n and output n-n=0.

      However, what if the entire string is "0"? 
          But the input condition: S has no leading zeros -> so if the entire string is "0", then the string is "0". 
          Then for L=1: we can take the entire string? Actually, we have the entire string is of length 1? 
          But note: we are building subsequences: we can take the entire string? 
          Actually, we are building subsequences of length L. For L=1, we can take the entire string? 
          But the entire string is "0" -> valid.

          But what if we try L=n? 
            n=1: then we do j=1: we get value 0 -> valid -> then we output n-1 = 0? 

          Actually, if the entire string is "0", then n=1. Then we try L=1: valid -> output 0.

      Therefore, the algorithm:

          for L in [n, n-1, ..., 1]:
             if we can form a subsequence of length L that is valid (without leading zeros and <=K) then 
                 answer = n - L, break

          If we break, output the answer.

      How to form for L=1? 
          We do: 
             dp_prev[i] = 0 or 1 as above.

          Then we check: for any i, dp_prev[i] <= K? -> yes, because 0<=K and 1<=K. So we break and output n-1.

      But wait: what if we have a subsequence of length 1 that is '0' and K=0? 
          But the problem states: K>=1. So we are safe.

  Implementation details:

      We set a constant BIG = K+1 (or something > K) to represent invalid states.

      Steps:

        Read K and S.

        n = len(S)

        BIG = K+1   (or we can use a large number? but K can be up to 2^60, so we use K+1)

        For L from n down to 1:

          # Build for j=1 to j=L (if L>=1)

          # For j=1: 
             dp_prev = [0]*n
             for i in range(n):
                 if S[i]=='0': 
                     dp_prev[i] = 0
                 else:
                     dp_prev[i] = 1

          # If L==1: check if there is at least one value in dp_prev <= K -> always true? then we break.

          # But note: we are going to check L=1 separately? Actually, we can break when L=1? 
          # However, we are iterating L from n to 1. We can break as soon as we find a valid L.

          # How to check for L=1: we can break and output n-1? 

          # But note: what if L>=2? Then we do:

          if L==1:
              # Then we know we can form a subsequence of length 1? 
              # Actually, we don't need to build for j>=2. We break and output n-1.
              break

          Else (L>=2):
             for j in range(2, L+1):   # we are building from j=2 to j=L
                 dp_curr = [BIG] * n   # initialize current dp for j
                 min_so_far = BIG      # we will traverse i from 0 to n-1, and we want the minimal value in dp_prev for indices < i (that are valid: non-zero and <=K? actually, we require non-zero for extending? but note: the state j-1 must be non-zero? because we are building a sequence of length j-1 that must be non-zero? Actually, we skip zeros for j>=2? 

                 for i in range(0, n):
                     # Consider forming a subsequence of length j ending at i: we extend a subsequence of length j-1 that ends at some k < i.

                     if min_so_far != BIG: 
                         bit_val = 1 if S[i]=='1' else 0
                         candidate = min_so_far * 2 + bit_val
                         if candidate <= K:
                             dp_curr[i] = candidate

                     # Now update min_so_far with dp_prev[i] for the next positions? 
                     # But note: we only consider states that are non-zero? Actually, we skip zeros? 
                     if dp_prev[i] != BIG and dp_prev[i] <= K and dp_prev[i] != 0: 
                         # Why skip zero? because we are building j>=2 and we cannot extend a sequence that starts with zero? Actually, we cannot extend a zero state? 
                         # But note: the state dp_prev[i] is for a subsequence of length j-1. If it is zero, then it must be that j-1==1 and the bit is zero? Then we skip because we cannot extend a zero state to form a sequence of length j (which would be two characters: the first is zero, then the current bit -> invalid).
                         if min_so_far == BIG:
                             min_so_far = dp_prev[i]
                         else:
                             if dp_prev[i] < min_so_far:
                                 min_so_far = dp_prev[i]

                 # After processing all i for this j, set dp_prev = dp_curr for the next j (if any)

             # After building for j=L, we have dp_prev for states of length L? 
             # Then we check: is there any i such that dp_prev[i] <= K? 
             for val in dp_prev:
                 if val <= K:
                     # We found a valid subsequence of length L -> answer = n - L
                     print(n - L)
                     return   # or break out and then output

          End if

        # If we finish the loop without breaking, then we break at L=1? Actually, we haven't broken? Then we output n-1? 
        # But note: we break at L=1? Actually, we didn't break at L>=2? Then we break at L=1? 

        How to handle L=1? 
          We can do: 
             if L==1: 
                 print(n-1)
                 return

        But note: we are iterating L from n down to 1. We break when we find a valid L.

        We have to do: 
            For L in [n, n-1, ..., 1]:
                if L==1: 
                    # then we break and output n-1
                    break
                else:
                    # build for j=2 to L
                    # if we found a valid state: output n-L and return.

            Then after the loop, we output n-1.

        Alternatively, we can do:

            for L in range(n, 0, -1):
                if L==1:
                    print(n-1)
                    return
                else:
                    # build for j=2 to L
                    # if we found any valid state: then output n-L and return.

            But note: we must break the loop when we find one? 

        Actually, we can restructure:

            for L in range(n, 0, -1):
                if L==1:
                    # We know we can form a subsequence of length 1? 
                    print(n-1)
                    return
                else:
                    # build for j from 2 to L
                    # then check: if any state in the final dp_prev is <=K -> then output n-L and return.

            But what if for L>=2 we did not break? Then we go to L=1 and break.

        However, we must build for each L? 

        But note: we are iterating from large L to small. We break as soon as we find a valid L.

        But worst-case we try all L until L=1.

        Since n<=60, it's acceptable.

      However, worst-case we do O(n) iterations, and each iteration j from 2 to L (which is O(n)) and then inside we do O(n) per j. So total O(n^3) = 60^3 = 216000, which is acceptable.

  But note: what if L=1? We don't build anything? We break and output n-1? 

      Actually, we don't need to build for L=1: we know it's always valid? 

      Therefore, we can do:

        for L in range(n, 1, -1):   # from n down to 2
            # Build for j=2 to L
            dp_prev_j = ...   # for j=1: base state for j=1

            # Actually, we have to build the base state for j=1 every time? 

            But note: we are iterating L from n down to 2. For each L we build from j=1 to j=L? 

            How to build for j=1? That base state is independent of L? 

            We can do:

                dp_prev = base_state_j1   # which is: for each i: 0 or 1.

                for j in range(2, L+1):
                    ... as above ...

                then check if any value in the final dp_prev <=K -> then output n-L and return.

        If we didn't break in L from n to 2, then we output n-1.

      But note: we might have L=1 always valid? 

      However, what if the entire string is "0"? 
          Then n=1. Then we don't enter the loop? Then we output n-1 = 0.

      What if n>=2? Then we try L from n to 2. If none found, then we output n-1.

  Alternatively, we can do:

        for L in range(n, 0, -1):
            if L == 1:
                # we know we can form a subsequence of length 1? 
                print(n-1)
                return
            else:
                # Build the dp for length L starting from j=1 and building up to j=L.
                # But note: we have to build the base state for j=1 every time? 
                dp_prev = [0]*n
                for i in range(n):
                    if S[i]=='0':
                        dp_prev[i] = 0
                    else:
                        dp_prev[i] = 1

                # Now we want to build for j=2 to j=L.
                found = False
                for j in range(2, L+1):
                    dp_curr = [BIG] * n
                    min_so_far = BIG
                    for i in range(0, n):
                        if min_so_far != BIG:
                            bit_val = 1 if S[i]=='1' else 0
                            candidate = min_so_far * 2 + bit_val
                            if candidate <= K:
                                dp_curr[i] = candidate
                        # Update min_so_far: we require that the state at i (from dp_prev) is non-zero? 
                        if dp_prev[i] != BIG and dp_prev[i] <= K and dp_prev[i] != 0:
                            if min_so_far == BIG:
                                min_so_far = dp_prev[i]
                            else:
                                if dp_prev[i] < min_so_far:
                                    min_so_far = dp_prev[i]
                    dp_prev = dp_curr

                # Check if there is any valid state in dp_prev for j=L?
                for val in dp_prev:
                    if val <= K:
                        print(n - L)
                        return

        # If we get here, then we break the loop? Actually, we break at L=1? 
        # But note: we return in the L=1 case? 
        # Actually, we are iterating L from n to 1? and we are handling L=1 separately? 

        How do we handle L=1? 
          We have an if L==1 inside the loop? 

        Actually, we are iterating L from n to 1. When L==1, we break and output n-1? 

        But note: if n==1, then we do L=1 -> then we break and output 0.

        However, what if n>=2? Then we iterate L from n down to 2, and then L=1? 

        But we are returning in the middle? 

        Alternatively, we can do:

            if we break in the inner loop for any L>=2, we return.

            Otherwise, we output n-1.

        But we are iterating L from n down to 1, and if we get to L=1 we output n-1.

        We can restructure without a loop for L? 

        Actually, we can break the problem:

            We know that the worst-case answer is n-1.

            We want to know: what is the maximal L (from 1 to n) such that there exists a subsequence of length L that is valid? 

            Then answer = n - L.

            We can iterate L from n down to 1, and the first L that we find that has a valid subsequence, we output n-L.

            So:

                for L in [n, n-1, ..., 1]:
                    if L==1: 
                        # then we know it's valid -> break and output n-1
                        break
                    else:
                        build the entire dp for length L? 
                        if we find a valid subsequence: output n-L and return.

                # Then we output n-1.

        Code:

            for L in range(n, 0, -1):
                if L == 1:
                    break
                # Build base state for j=1
                dp_prev = [0]*n
                for i in range(n):
                    if S[i]=='0':
                        dp_prev[i] = 0
                    else:
                        dp_prev[i] = 1

                # For j from 2 to L:
                for j in range(2, L+1):
                    dp_curr = [BIG] * n
                    min_so_far = BIG
                    for i in range(n):
                        if min_so_far != BIG:
                            bit_val = 1 if S[i]=='1' else 0
                            candidate = min_so_far * 2 + bit_val
                            if candidate <= K:
                                dp_curr[i] = candidate
                        # Update min_so_far from dp_prev[i] if valid and non-zero? 
                        if dp_prev[i] != BIG and dp_prev[i] != 0 and dp_prev[i] <= K:
                            if min_so_far == BIG:
                                min_so_far = dp_prev[i]
                            else:
                                min_so_far = min(min_so_far, dp_prev[i])
                    dp_prev = dp_curr

                # Check for any valid state in the last dp_prev (which is for j=L)
                for val in dp_prev:
                    if val <= K:
                        print(n - L)
                        return

            # If we get here, then we break from the loop meaning we didn't find any L>=2? 
            print(n-1)
            return

  However, note: what if we have a subsequence of length L that is valid and we break and output n-L? 

  But what if the entire string is valid? 
      Then we break at L = n -> output 0.

  But note: what if we have a subsequence of length L that is valid, but we skip a larger L? 
      We are iterating from n down to 1, so the first valid L we find is the largest possible? 

  Therefore, we break at the largest L that is valid? 

  But note: we are building for each L independently? 

  However, building the dp for a fixed L: 
      We start from j=1 and build up to j=L. 

  But note: the state for j=1 is the same for every L? 

  And the state for j=2 is built the same for every L that is at least 2? 

  But we are building for each L independently? 

  This is acceptable because n is only 60. The worst-case we do about (n-1) iterations for L (from n to 2) and each L we do (L-1) iterations for j (from 2 to L) and each j we do O(n). The total operations:

      Sum_{L=2}^{n} (L-1)*n 
      = n * Sum_{L=2}^{n} (L-1)
      = n * ( (n-1)*n/2 - ... )? Actually, the inner sum is the sum of integers from 1 to n-1: which is n*(n-1)/2.

      So total operations: n * (n*(n-1)/2) = O(n^3) = 60^3/2 = 108000, which is acceptable.

  But note: what if we have multiple states? We are storing an array of size n per j? 

  Therefore, we can code accordingly.

  However, note: what if the base state j=1: we have to build it for each L? 

  But we can precompute the base state? It is independent of L? 

      Actually, we can precompute base_state = [0 or 1 for each i] and then for each L we start with that base_state? 

  Let me write the code accordingly.

  One more issue: we skip zeros in the update of min_so_far? 

      For j>=2, we only extend from states that are non-zero? 

      Why? because the state of the previous step (j-1) must form a valid binary number without leading zeros? and if it is zero then the entire sequence we are building would be of the form "0" + ...? but wait: we are building the entire sequence of length j-1, and if it is zero then it must be a single zero? Actually, no: we are building a sequence of length j-1, so if it is zero then j-1 must be 1? 

      Then we are extending a sequence of length 1 that is zero? Then the new sequence would be of the form "0" + (next bit). That has a leading zero? -> invalid. 

      Therefore, we skip states that are zero? 

  But note: what if we have a state that is zero for j-1? That only happens when j-1==1 and the bit is zero? 

      Then we skip that state for j>=2? 

  Therefore, in the update for min_so_far (for j>=2) we skip if dp_prev[i] is zero? 

  However, note: we also skip if dp_prev[i] is BIG? and if dp_prev[i] > K? 

  We do: 
        if dp_prev[i] != BIG and dp_prev[i] != 0 and dp_prev[i] <= K:

  But note: if dp_prev[i] is 0, then we skip? 

  But what if the state is non-zero? Then we update min_so_far? 

  However, what if we have a state that is non-zero? Then it must be at least 1? 

  Example: 
      S = "10", K=1, L=2: 
          j=1: 
             dp_prev[0] = 1 (for S[0]=='1')
             dp_prev[1] = 0 (for S[1]=='0')
          Then j=2: 
             We traverse i=0: 
                 min_so_far = BIG -> skip candidate.
                 Then update: at i=0: dp_prev[0]=1 -> non-zero and <=K? then min_so_far=1.
             Then i=1:
                 min_so_far=1 -> candidate = 1*2 + 0 = 2 -> which is > K=1 -> so we skip.
                 Then update: at i=1: dp_prev[1]=0 -> we skip? 
             Then no valid state for j=2? 

          Therefore, we do not find a subsequence of length 2? 
          Then we go to L=1 -> output n-1 = 1.

          But the entire string "10" is 2 in decimal? which is >K=1? -> so we cannot leave the entire string. 
          What about leaving "1" (at index0) -> 1<=1? valid -> so we remove the last bit -> removal=1? -> output 1? 
          But we output n-1 = 2-1 = 1? 

          So the answer is 1? 

      But the problem: we are allowed to leave a subsequence? We can leave the first '1'? 

      So the algorithm is correct.

  Let me test with the sample: 
      Sample 1: K=13, S="1100101"

      We know the answer is 3.

      We try L=7: the entire string? 
          The entire string is 101 in decimal? which is 5? but wait: the entire string is 1100101 -> 
          1100101 in binary is 101? Actually, 101 is 5 in decimal? 
          Then 5<=13 -> so we don't need to remove any? 
          But the problem says we remove 3 bits? 

      Why? 
          The problem says: 
            We can remove the 3rd, 5th, and 6th most significant bits: 1100101 -> 1101 (which is 13).

          But note: we can also leave the entire string? 1100101 = 1*64 + 1*32 + 0*16 + 0*8 + 1*4 + 0*2 + 1*1 = 64+32+4+1 = 101? 
          Then 101>13? 

          Actually, I think I miscalculated: 
            The string is "1100101" -> 
               1: 2^6 = 64
               1: 2^5 = 32
               0: 0
               0: 0
               1: 2^2 = 4
               0: 0
               1: 2^0 = 1
            total: 64+32+4+1 = 101.

          So the entire string is 101, which is greater than 13? 

          Therefore, we cannot leave the entire string.

      Then we try L=6: 
          We have to form a subsequence of length 6. 

          How many ways? 

          We want the minimal value? 

          The minimal value for a subsequence of length 6: we want to start with 1 and then as many zeros as possible? 
          But note: we must preserve order.

          Possibilities: 
            "100001" -> 100001 = 33? 
            "100101" -> 37? 
            "110001" -> 49? 
            etc.

          But we want <=13? 

          The minimal value we can form for a subsequence of length 6: 
            The first bit must be the first '1' (at index0) -> then we can take the next zeros? 
            Then we get: 100000? but we don't have five zeros after the first one? 
            Actually: 
                S: 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
                We can form: 100000? -> but we don't have 5 zeros? 

          Actually, we have to form a subsequence of length 6: we must take the first '1'? 
          Then we need 5 more bits? 

          The smallest value we can form: 
            Take the first '1', then the next four zeros? but we only have two zeros? 
            Then we have to take ones? 

          The minimal value: 100000 = 32? which is >13.

          So no subsequence of length 6 is <=13.

      Then we try L=5: 
          The minimal value we can form: 10000? = 16 -> which is >13? 
          or 10001? = 17? 
          or 10010? = 18? 
          or 10011? = 19? 
          or 10100? = 20? 
          ... 
          All are at least 16? 

          So we skip.

      Then we try L=4: 
          Minimal value: 1000? = 8 -> which is <=13? 
          But can we form 1000? 
          S: 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
          We can take:
             first '1' (at index0), then the next two zeros (index2 and index3), then we need a zero at the end? but we have a zero at index5? 
          So: 1 (index0), 0 (index2), 0 (index3), 0 (index5) -> 1000? 
          But wait: that is 1000? -> 8, which is <=13.

          Why then the answer is 3? 

          The problem states: 
             We removed 3 bits to get 1101 -> which is 13.

          But we can also remove 3 bits to get 1000? which is 8? 

          Then why is the answer 3? 

          Actually, we want the minimum removals. 
          We can remove 3 bits to get 1000? -> removal=3, which is the same as the sample output.

          But note: the problem says: 
              "the minimum number of bits to be removed"

          And 3 is the minimum? 

          However, the problem states: 
              "If we remove only 2 bits, then we will have a binary string of length 5 bits; notice that any binary string of length 5 bits has a value of at least 16 in decimal representation"

          So 16>13 -> so we need at least 3 removals.

          Therefore, we break at L=4? 

          Then we output n-L = 7-4 = 3.

      So the algorithm for L=4 must find a valid subsequence? 

      How does the DP for L=4 work?

          j=1: 
             dp_prev = [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]

          j=2:
             dp_curr = [BIG]*7

             i=0: 
                 min_so_far is BIG -> skip candidate.
                 then update: dp_prev[0]=1 -> non-zero -> min_so_far=1

             i=1:
                 candidate = 1*2 + 1 = 3 -> set dp_curr[1]=3
                 then update: dp_prev[1]=1 -> update min_so_far = min(1,1)=1 -> remains 1.

             i=2:

                 update: dp_prev[2]=0 -> skip -> min_so_far remains 1.

             i=3:
                 candidate = 1*2+0=2 -> set dp_curr[3]=2
                 update: skip (0) -> min_so_far=1.

             i=4:
                 candidate = 1*2+1=3 -> set dp_curr[4]=3
                 update: dp_prev[4]=1 -> min_so_far=min(1,1)=1.

             i=5:
                 candidate = 1*2+0=2 -> set dp_curr[5]=2
                 update: skip (0) -> min_so_far=1.

             i=6:
                 candidate = 1*2+1=3 -> set dp_curr[6]=3
                 update: dp_prev[6]=1 -> min_so_far=1.

             Then dp_curr = [BIG, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]

          j=3:
             dp_prev = [BIG, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]
             dp_curr = [BIG]*7
             min_so_far = BIG

             i=0: skip (min_so_far BIG) -> then update: dp_prev[0]=BIG -> skip -> min_so_far remains BIG.

             i=1: 
                 min_so_far BIG -> skip candidate.
                 update: dp_prev[1]=3 -> non-zero -> min_so_far=3

             i=2:
                 candidate = 3*2+0=6 -> set dp_curr[2]=6
                 update: dp_prev[2]=2 -> non-zero -> min_so_far=min(3,2)=2

             i=3:
                 candidate = 2*2+0=4 -> set dp_curr[3]=4
                 update: dp_prev[3]=2 -> min_so_far=2

             i=4:
                 candidate = 2*2+1=5 -> set dp_curr[4]=5
                 update: dp_prev[4]=3 -> min_so_far=min(2,3)=2

             i=5:
                 candidate = 2*2+0=4 -> set dp_curr[5]=4
                 update: dp_prev[5]=2 -> min_so_far=2

             i=6:
                 candidate = 2*2+1=5 -> set dp_curr[6]=5
                 update: dp_prev[6]=3 -> min_so_far=2

          j=4:
             dp_prev = [BIG, BIG, 6,4,5,4,5]   # actually, we had for j=3: [BIG, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3] -> then j=3: [BIG, BIG, 6,4,5,4,5]? 
                 Actually, at j=3, we set:
                    i0: BIG -> skip
                    i1: skip candidate? then update: min_so_far becomes 3 (from dp_prev[1]=3) -> then at i2: candidate = 3*2+0=6 -> then update min_so_far with dp_prev[2]=2 -> becomes 2? 
                 Then for i3: candidate=2*2+0=4 -> then update min_so_far=min(2,2)=2? 
                 Then i4: candidate=2*2+1=5 -> then update min_so_far=min(2,3)=2? 
                 Then i5: candidate=2*2+0=4 -> then update min_so_far=min(2,2)=2? 
                 Then i6: candidate=2*2+1=5 -> then update min_so_far=min(2,3)=2? 

                 Then for j=4: we start with dp_prev = [BIG, BIG, 6,4,5,4,5]  (from j=3)

                 Then for j=4:
                    min_so_far = BIG
                    i0: skip, update: skip (BIG) -> min_so_far remains BIG.
                    i1: skip, update: skip (BIG) -> min_so_far remains BIG.
                    i2: skip, update: dp_prev[2]=6 -> non-zero? yes -> min_so_far=6
                    i3: candidate = 6*2+0=12 -> set dp_curr[3]=12
                         update: dp_prev[3]=4 -> min_so_far=min(6,4)=4
                    i4: candidate = 4*2+1=9 -> set dp_curr[4]=9
                         update: dp_prev[4]=5 -> min_so_far=min(4,5)=4
                    i5: candidate = 4*2+0=8 -> set dp_curr[5]=8
                         update: dp_prev[5]=4 -> min_so_far=min(4,4)=4
                    i6: candidate = 4*2+1=9 -> set dp_curr[6]=9
                         update: dp_prev[6]=5 -> min_so_far=4

                 Then we have at j=4: 
                    dp_curr = [BIG, BIG, BIG, 12,9,8,9]

                 Then we check: are any of 12,9,8,9 <=13? 
                    12<=13 -> valid? 
                    So we break and output n-4 = 3.

          Therefore, we output 3.

  Another sample: K=13, S="1111111" -> expected output=4.

      We try L=7: the entire string: 1111111 = 127 -> too big.
      L=6: 111111 = 63 -> too big.
      L=5: 11111 = 31 -> too big.
      L=4: 1111 = 15 -> too big? 
      L=3: 111 = 7 -> valid? 

      Then we output n-3 = 7-3 = 4.

      So the answer is 4.

      How does the DP work for L=3? 
        j=1: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

        j=2: 
           i0: skip candidate, then update min_so_far=1 (from dp_prev[0]=1)
           i1: candidate=1*2+1=3 -> set dp_curr[1]=3 -> then update min_so_far=min(1,1)=1.
           i2: candidate=1*2+1=3 -> set dp_curr[2]=3 -> min_so_far=1.
           ... all positions get 3? 

        j=3:
           dp_prev = [1,3,3,3,3,3,3]  (but we stored the minimal value per index? and we update min_so_far with the minimal non-zero value? so we start with min_so_far=BIG.
           i0: skip candidate, update: dp_prev[0]=1 -> min_so_far=1.
           i1: candidate=1*2+1=3 -> set dp_curr[1]=3 -> then update: min_so_far = min(1,3)=1.
           i2: candidate=1*2+1=3 -> set dp_curr[2]=3 -> min_so_far=1.
           ... all positions get 3.

        Then we check: 3<=13 -> valid? 

        Then we output 7-3=4.

  Therefore, the code:

      Precomputation: 
          BIG = K+1   (if K is the maximum, then we cannot have a number >K)

      Steps:

          n = len(S)

          if n==0: output 0? but n>=1.

          for L in range(n, 0, -1):
              if L == 1:
                  # We break and output n-1? 
                  print(n-1)
                  return

              # Build base state for j=1
              dp_prev = [0] * n
              for i in range(n):
                  if S[i]=='0':
                      dp_prev[i] = 0
                  else:
                      dp_prev[i] = 1

              # Now build for j from 2 to L
              for j in range(2, L+1):
                  dp_curr = [BIG] * n
                  min_so_far = BIG   # we will keep the minimal valid value (non-zero and <=K) from dp_prev for indices < i

                  for i in range(n):
                      # If we have at least one valid state in the previous state (for indices < i) then we can form a candidate ending at i
                      if min_so_far != BIG:
                          bit_val = 1 if S[i]=='1' else 0
                          candidate = min_so_far * 2 + bit_val
                          if candidate <= K:
                              dp_curr[i] = candidate
                          # else: leave as BIG
                      # Now update min_so_far with dp_prev[i] if valid and non-zero? 
                      if dp_prev[i] != BIG and dp_prev[i] != 0 and dp_prev[i] <= K:
                          if min_so_far == BIG:
                              min_so_far = dp_prev[i]
                          else:
                              if dp_prev[i] < min_so_far:
                                  min_so_far = dp_prev[i]

                  # After building j, set dp_prev to dp_curr for the next j
                  dp_prev = dp_curr

              # After building j=L, check if there is any valid state in dp_prev (for j=L)
              found = False
              for val in dp_prev:
                  if val <= K:
                      print(n - L)
                      return

          # We should not get here because L=1 is always valid? 
          print(n-1)

  However, note: we break at L=1? So we never get to the end? 

  But what if we don't break in the inner loops? Then we break at L=1? 

  But note: we have a return in the L=1 branch? 

  Actually, we have:

      for L in range(n,0,-1):
          if L==1:
              print(n-1)
              return   # or break the loop? but we return.

          else:
              ... 
              if we find a valid state: we output and return.

  So we return in one of the branches.

  Let me test with a small example: n=1, S="1", K=1.

      L from 1 down to 1: 
          L==1: then we output n-1 = 0 -> and return.

  Another: n=1, S="0", K=1 -> output 0.

  But what if n=1, S="1", K=0? 
      Then K=0: 
          We try L=1: 
            then we output n-1=0? 
          But 1>0 -> invalid? 

      But the problem: K>=1.

  So we are safe.

  Therefore, we write the code accordingly.

  However, note: we are using an array of size n for each j. And j goes from 2 to L. The worst-case L can be n, then we do n-1 iterations of j? and each j we do O(n). So worst-case O(n^2) per L? and then we iterate L from n to 2: so total O(n^3). 

  Since n<=60, worst-case 60^3 = 216000, which is acceptable.

  But note: we are iterating L from n down to 2? and then we break as soon as we find one? 

  So worst-case we try all L? 

  However, worst-case the entire string is invalid until L=1? Then we try all L from n to 2? 

  But worst-case n=60, then the total operations is about:

      Sum_{L=2}^{60} (L-1)*n 
        = n * (1+2+...+(n-1))
        = n * (n-1)*n/2 
        = 60 * 59 * 60 / 2 = 60*59*30 = 106200, which is acceptable.

  Let me code accordingly.

  Note: We must be cautious with big integers? 
        K can be up to 2^60 -> about 1e18, so we use unsigned long long? or long long? 

        But the problem: the candidate = min_so_far * 2 + bit_val

        min_so_far might be up to 2^(j-1)-1? which for j up to 60: 2^60-1 -> that is within the range of unsigned long long (which is 0 to 2^64-1) but for j=60, 2^60 is about 1e18, so multiplying by 2 might be 2e18? which is within unsigned long long? 

        But note: if min_so_far is BIG (which is K+1) then we skip candidate? 

        Actually, we only compute candidate if min_so_far != BIG, and then we check if candidate <= K? 

        But if min_so_far is already > K? we skip? 

        Actually, we update min_so_far only from states that are <=K and non-zero. So min_so_far is always <=K? 

        Then candidate = min_so_far * 2 + bit_val <= K*2 + 1. 

        But K can be 2^60, then candidate might be 2^61+1, which is beyond 2^60? 

        But we check candidate <= K? 

        However, if K is 2^60, then candidate might be 2^61+1 which is > K? so we skip.

        But we are using unsigned long long? 

        In C++: we can use unsigned long long? 

        But note: K can be 2^60, so we can represent K as unsigned long long.

        Steps:

          BIG = K+1   -> but if K is 2^60, then K+1 is 2^60+1 which is representable in unsigned long long? 

          However, if K is 2^60, then K+1 is 2^60+1, which is within the range of unsigned long long (which is 0 to 2^64-1).

        But note: what if candidate becomes very big? We only compute candidate if min_so_far != BIG and then check candidate <= K? 

        But if min_so_far is <=K, then candidate = min_so_far*2+1 <= 2*K+1. 
          But K can be up to 2^60, so 2*K+1 can be 2^61+1, which is about 2.3e18? which is within unsigned long long? 

        So we can use unsigned long long for all numbers.

  Therefore, we code in C++ with unsigned long long.

  However, note: the problem says K is an integer in [1, 2^60] and |S|<=60.

  Code:

      #include <iostream>
      #include <vector>
      #include <string>
      #include <climits>
      #include <cctype>
      #include <algorithm>
      using namespace std;

      int main() {
          unsigned long long K;
          string S;
          cin >> K;
          cin >> S;
          int n = S.size();

          // BIG is a number that is greater than K, we use K+1. But if K is the maximum unsigned long long? 
          // Since K <= 2^60, then K+1 is at most 2^60+1, which is < 2^64 -> representable.

          unsigned long long BIG = K+1;

          // We iterate L from n down to 1
          for (int L = n; L>=1; L--) {
              if (L == 1) {
                  // We know we can form a subsequence of length 1? 
                  cout << n-1 << endl;
                  return 0;
              }

              // Build base state for j=1: 
              vector<unsigned long long> dp_prev(n, BIG);
              for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
                  if (S[i]=='0') {
                      dp_prev[i] = 0;
                  } else {
                      dp_prev[i] = 1;
                  }
              }

              // Now we build for j from 2 to L
              for (int j=2; j<=L; j++) {

                      // Try to form a candidate at i if we have any valid state in the previous states (for indices < i)
                      if (min_so_far != BIG) {
                          int bit_val = (S[i]=='1')? 1 : 0;
                          unsigned long long candidate = min_so_far * 2 + bit_val;
                          // If candidate is too big? 
                          if (candidate <= K) {
                              dp_curr[i] = candidate;
                          }

                      //   dp_prev[i] <= K? 
                      //   and for j>=2, we skip zero? 
                      if (dp_prev[i] != BIG && dp_prev[i] <= K) {
                          // But note: for j>=2, we are building a sequence that must not have a leading zero? 
                          // However, the state dp_prev[i] is for a sequence of length j-1. 
                          // If j-1>=1, then if the sequence is non-zero, then it must be at least 1? 
                          // Actually, we skip zero? 
                          if (dp_prev[i] == 0) 
                              continue;

                          if (min_so_far == BIG) 
                              min_so_far = dp_prev[i];
                          else 
                              min_so_far = min(min_so_far, dp_prev[i]);
                      }
                  }

                  dp_prev = dp_curr;
              }

              // Check for any valid state in dp_prev (for j=L) 
              bool found = false;
              for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
                  if (dp_prev[i] <= K) {
                      found = true;
                      break;
                  }
              }
              if (found) {
                  cout << n - L << endl;
                  return 0;
              }
          }

          // We should not get here because we break at L=1
          cout << n-1 << endl;
          return 0;
      }

  But note: in the update for min_so_far, we skip if dp_prev[i] is zero? 

  And we break at L=1? 

  Let me test with the sample: "1100101", K=13.

      We expect to break at L=4 and output 3.

  However, note: in the j=4 loop, we update min_so_far? 
      We start with min_so_far = BIG.

      Then for i0: 
          candidate: skip (min_so_far is BIG)
          then update: dp_prev[0] is 1 -> non-zero -> min_so_far=1.

      i1: 
          candidate: 1*2+1=3 -> set dp_curr[1]=3
          update: dp_prev[1]=1 -> min_so_far=min(1,1)=1.

      i2: 
          candidate: 1*2+0=2 -> set dp_curr[2]=2
          update: skip if dp_prev[2] is zero? 
                dp_prev[2]=0 -> skip -> min_so_far remains 1.

      i3: 
          candidate: 1*2+0=2 -> set dp_curr[3]=2
          update: skip (0) -> min_so_far=1.

      i4: 
          candidate: 1*2+1=3 -> set dp_curr[4]=3
          update: dp_prev[4]=1 -> min_so_far=min(1,1)=1.

      i5: 
          candidate: 1*2+0=2 -> set dp_curr[5]=2
          update: skip (0) -> min_so_far=1.

      i6: 
          candidate: 1*2+1=3 -> set dp_curr[6]=3
          update: dp_prev[6]=1 -> min_so_far=1.

      Then j=2: dp_prev becomes [1,3,2,2,3,2,3]? 

      Then j=3: 
          min_so_far = BIG
          i0: candidate: skip -> update: dp_prev[0]=1 -> min_so_far=1.
          i1: candidate: 1*2+1=3 -> set dp_curr[1]=3 -> update: dp_prev[1]=3 -> min_so_far=min(1,3)=1.
          i2: candidate: 1*2+0=2 -> set dp_curr[2]=2 -> update: dp_prev[2]=2 -> min_so_far=min(1,2)=1.
          i3: candidate: 1*2+0=2 -> set dp_curr[3]=2 -> update: dp_prev[3]=2 -> min_so_far=min(1,2)=1.
          i4: candidate: 1*2+1=3 -> set dp_curr[4]=3 -> update: dp_prev[4]=3 -> min_so_far=1.
          i5: candidate: 1*2+0=2 -> set dp_curr[5]=2 -> update: dp_prev[5]=2 -> min_so_far=1.
          i6: candidate: 1*2+1=3 -> set dp_curr[6]=3 -> update: dp_prev[6]=3 -> min_so_far=1.

          Then j=3: dp_prev becomes [BIG,3,2,2,3,2,3]? 

          Actually, at i0: we set min_so_far=1 (from dp_prev[0]=1) and then for i0: we don't set any candidate? because we don't form a candidate at i0? 
          But note: the state at i0: we update min_so_far with dp_prev[0]=1? then for i1: we use min_so_far=1 to form candidate=1*2+1=3? 
          Then we update min_so_far at i1: min_so_far = min(1, dp_prev[1]=3) -> 1.

      Then j=4: 
          min_so_far = BIG
          i0: skip candidate -> then update: dp_prev[0]=BIG? -> skip -> min_so_far remains BIG.
          i1: skip candidate -> then update: dp_prev[1]=3 -> non-zero -> min_so_far=3.
          i2: candidate: 3*2+0=6 -> set dp_curr[2]=6 -> then update: dp_prev[2]=2 -> min_so_far=min(3,2)=2.
          i3: candidate: 2*2+0=4 -> set dp_curr[3]=4 -> update: min_so_far=min(2,2)=2.
          i4: candidate: 2*2+1=5 -> set dp_curr[4]=5 -> update: min_so_far=min(2,3)=2.
          i5: candidate: 2*2+0=4 -> set dp_curr[5]=4 -> update: min_so_far=min(2,2)=2.
          i6: candidate: 2*2+1=5 -> set dp_curr[6]=5 -> update: min_so_far=min(2,3)=2.

          Then we have for j=4: 
             dp_curr = [BIG, BIG, 6,4,5,4,5]

          Then we check: 6,4,5,4,5: 4<=13? yes -> so we break and output 3.

  Therefore, the code is correct.

  But note: in the update for min_so_far, we skip if dp_prev[i] is zero? 
      In the j=2 loop for the sample, at i2: we had a state 0? then we skip? 

  But note: the state 0 is for a subsequence of length 1 that is '0'. We are building j=2, so we cannot extend a zero state? 

  Therefore, the code.

  Let me run the second sample: S="1111111", K=13, n=7.

      We try L=7, then 6, then 5, then 4, then 3.

      For L=3:
          j=1: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

          j=2: 
             i0: skip candidate -> update min_so_far = 1 (from i0)
             i1: candidate = 1*2+1=3 -> set dp_curr[1]=3 -> update min_so_far=min(1,1)=1.
             i2: candidate=1*2+1=3 -> set dp_curr[2]=3 -> update min_so_far=1.
             ... all indices: 3.

          j=3: 
             dp_prev = [1,3,3,3,3,3,3]
             i0: skip candidate -> update min_so_far=1 (from i0)
             i1: candidate=1*2+1=3 -> set dp_curr[1]=3 -> update min_so_far=min(1,3)=1.
             i2: candidate=1*2+1=3 -> set dp_curr[2]=3 -> update min_so_far=1.
             ... all indices: 3.

          Then we check: 3<=13 -> valid -> output 7-3=4.

  Therefore, we output 4.

  We'll submit this.

  But note: what if there is a state that is BIG? then we skip? 

  We are updating min_so_far only for states that are not BIG and <=K and non-zero? 

  Correct.

  We'll run the sample: K=13, S="0"? 
      But the input condition: S has no leading zeros -> so S cannot be "0"? 
      Actually, the problem says: "S contains no leading zeroes", and "non-empty". 
      So if the string is "0", then it has no leading zeros? 
      But the problem says: "You may safely assume S contains no leading zeroes." -> so we assume the string might be "0"? 

      How do we handle "0"? 
          n=1, then L=1: we break and output 0.

      But what if the entire string is "0" and K=0? 
          But K>=1 -> so we are safe.

  Therefore, we are done.

  Let me write the C++ code accordingly.

  However, note: we are using unsigned long long for everything? 
      But what if K is 0? -> but K>=1.

  Code:

      #include <iostream>
      #include <vector>
      #include <string>
      #include <climits>
      #include <cctype>
      #include <algorithm>
      using namespace std;

      typedef unsigned long long ull;

      int main() {
          ull K;
          string S;
          cin >> K;
          cin >> S;
          int n = S.size();

          ull BIG = K+1;

          // Iterate L from n down to 1
          for (int L = n; L>=1; L--) {
              if (L == 1) {
                  cout << n-1 << endl;
                  return 0;
              }

              vector<ull> dp_prev(n, BIG);
              // j=1
              for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
                  if (S[i]=='0') 
                      dp_prev[i] = 0;
                  else 
                      dp_prev[i] = 1;
              }

              bool valid_j = true;
              for (int j=2; j<=L; j++) {
                  vector<ull> dp_curr(n, BIG);
                  ull min_so_far = BIG;

                  for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
                      // If we have a valid min_so_far (from indices < i) then form candidate
                      if (min_so_far != BIG) {
                          ull bit_val = (S[i]=='1')? 1 : 0;
                          ull candidate = min_so_far * 2 + bit_val;
                          if (candidate <= K) {
                              dp_curr[i] = candidate;
                          }
                      }

                      // Update min_so_far: we require that the state at i (from the previous j-1) is non-zero? 
                      if (dp_prev[i] != BIG && dp_prev[i] <= K) {
                          // Skip zero? 
                          if (dp_prev[i] == 0) 
                              continue;

                          if (min_so_far == BIG) 
                              min_so_far = dp_prev[i];
                          else 
                              min_so_far = min(min_so_far, dp_prev[i]);
                      }
                  }
                  dp_prev = dp_curr;
              }

              // Check if for L we have at least one valid state?
              bool found = false;
              for (ull val : dp_prev) {
                  if (val <= K) {
                      found = true;
                      break;
                  }
              }
              if (found) {
                  cout << n - L << endl;
                  return 0;
              }
          }

          // We should not get here because L=1 always breaks.
          cout << n-1 << endl;
          return 0;
      }

  But note: what if the entire string is "0" (n=1)? 
        Then we go to L=1: output 0.

  What if the entire string is "1" and n=1, K=1? 
        Then we go to L=1: output 0.

  What if the entire string is "1" and n=1, K=0? 
        But K>=1 -> so we don't worry.

  However, the problem says K>=1.

  Let me test with the provided samples.

  Sample 1: K=13, S="1100101" -> output 3? 
  Sample 2: K=13, S="1111111" -> output 4.

  We'll run the code on the samples.

  But note: we have to be cautious: the problem says the entire string has no leading zeros? so the first character is '1'? 
        But what if the string has a zero at the beginning? 
        Actually, the problem says "contains no leading zeroes", so the first character is not '0'? 

        But note: what if the string is "0"? then the first character is '0'. 
        And the problem says: "contains no leading zeroes" -> but "0" is acceptable? 

        However, the problem says: "Ayu has a favorite binary string S which contains no leading zeroes." -> so if the string is "0", that has no leading zeros? 

        Therefore, we allow the base state for j=1: if the character is '0', we set 0.

        And when we build j=2: we skip the state 0? so we do not extend a state that is 0? 

        That matches: we cannot form a sequence of length>=2 that starts with zero? 

        So if the string is "0", then we break at L=1: output 0.

  Therefore, the code is ready.

  However, note: what if the string is "01"? 
        The problem states: "contains no leading zeroes" -> so the input string will not be "01". 

        We assume the input S is given without leading zeros.

  Therefore, we don't have to worry about strings that start with zero? 

  But note: what if we remove the first character? Then we might get a subsequence that starts with a zero? 
        The problem: we must not leave a subsequence that has leading zeros? 
        So if we form a subsequence that starts with a zero and has length>=2, that is invalid.

        Our DP for j>=2 does not extend from a zero state? so we avoid that.

        Also, when we form a subsequence that starts with a zero? that can only be a subsequence of length 1? 

        Therefore, our base state for j=1 includes zeros? and then for j>=2 we skip zeros? 

  So we are safe.

  We'll run the sample: S="01" (if the input allows it? but the problem says no leading zeros) so we don't have to test.

  But the problem says: "You may safely assume S contains no leading zeroes." -> so the first character is not '0'? 

  Therefore, the base state for j=1: 
        For the first character: it must be '1'? 

        Then dp_prev[0] = 1.

        Then for the next character: if it's '0', then we set 0.

        Then for j=2: 
            i0: skip candidate -> update min_so_far=1 (from dp_prev[0]=1)
            i1: candidate=1*2+0=2 -> set dp_curr[1]=2 -> then update min_so_far: dp_prev[1]=0 -> skip -> min_so_far remains 1.

        Then we have a valid state at i1: 2? 

        Then for L=2: we break and output 0? 

        But the entire string "01" is "01" -> which has a leading zero? -> invalid? 

        However, we are forming a subsequence that is the entire string? 
          But we are forming a subsequence that starts with the first character? then the second? 
          So the subsequence is "01", which has a leading zero? -> invalid.

        But our DP for j=2: we set the state at i1 to 2? 
          How did we form it? 
            We started with the state at i0 (which is the first character '1') and then appended the second character '0'? 
            That forms "10" (binary) = 2? 

          But wait: the subsequence is formed by taking the first character and then the second? so the string is "10", not "01". 

        How do we form the subsequence? 
          We maintain the order of the bits? 

          The subsequence we form is: we take the first character (index0) and then the second character (index1) -> that is "10", not "01". 

        Therefore, we do not form "01", we form "10". 

        Why? because we are traversing the string from left to right? 

        Actually, the subsequence must maintain the order? so we take the bits in increasing index order.

        Therefore, the subsequence we form by taking the first character and then the second is the string "10", which is valid.

        So the entire string "01" is not used? we use "10" which is a subsequence of "01" (if we are allowed to rearrange? but we are not: we must preserve the order).

        Actually, the problem: 
            "remove zero or more bits from S while maintaining the order of the remaining bits"

        So we cannot change the order? 

        Therefore, the subsequence we form from "01" by taking the first character and then the second is "01"? 
            No: the first character is '0', the second is '1'. 
            Then the subsequence is "01", which is 1 in decimal? 
            But it has a leading zero? -> invalid.

        How do we form "10"? 
            We cannot form "10" from "01" because we must preserve the order? 

        Therefore, the only valid subsequences of length 2 from "01" are "00", "01", "11"? 
            But we can't form "00" because the string has only one '0'. 
            We can form "01" -> invalid (leading zero) and "11" -> we don't have two ones? 

        Therefore, we cannot form a subsequence of length 2 from "01". 

        Then we break at L=1: output 1-1=0? 

        But the entire string is "01", we must remove at least one bit? 

        However, we can form a subsequence of length 1: 
            "0" -> invalid? because a single zero is valid? 
            Or "1" -> valid? 

        So we can remove the first character and leave the second? -> then we have "1" -> valid? 

        Therefore, we remove one bit? -> removals=1.

        But our algorithm: 
            We try L=2: not found? 
            Then L=1: we output n-1=1? -> 2-1=1.

        So output 1? 

        But note: we break at L=1 and output n-1=1? 

        Therefore, the answer is 1.

        But wait: what if we leave the first character? 
            We get "0" -> which is valid? 
            Then we remove the second character? -> removals=1? 
            But then we have "0", which is valid? 

        So we can remove one bit and leave the first character? 

        Therefore, we have two possibilities: leave "0" or "1". 

        The minimal removals is 1? 

        Our algorithm: 
            For L=1: we break and output 1? 

        Then we output 1.

        However, the problem: we break at the largest L that is valid? 
            But we found L=1? 

        And we output n-1=1? 

        Therefore, the answer is 1.

        But note: we have two subsequences of length 1: 
            "0" -> valid? 
            "1" -> valid? 

        So we break at L=1? 

        Therefore, the code is correct.

  But note: the input condition: the string has no leading zeros? so the first character is not '0'? 
        Therefore, the string "01" is not a valid input? 

        The problem: "S contains no leading zeroes" -> so the first character is not '0'? 

        Therefore, we don't have to worry about "01". 

  We'll submit.

  However, note: what if the string is "10"? 
        Then the entire string is valid? so we break at L=2? and output 0.

  But the entire string "10" is 2? which is > K=1? 
        Then we try L=2: 
            j=1: [1,0] -> 
            j=2: 
                i0: skip candidate -> update min_so_far=1 (from i0)
                i1: candidate = 1*2+0=2 -> which is >K=1? so we skip.
                then update min_so_far at i1: skip because 0? 
            Then no valid state for j=2? 
        Then we break at L=1: output 2-1=1.

        Correct.

  Therefore, the code is as below.

  One more: the entire string is "10", K=2? 
        Then L=2: 
            candidate at i1: 2 -> <=2 -> set dp_curr[1]=2 -> then we break and output 0.

  Correct.

  We'll run the provided samples.

  Sample1: 
      K=13, S="1100101"
          We break at L=4 and output 3.

  Sample2:
      K=13, S="1111111"
          We break at L=3 and output 4.

  We run the code:

      Sample1: 
          L=7,6,5: skip (we don't find valid state)
          L=4: 
              j=1: [1,1,0,0,1,0,1]
              j=2: 
                 dp_curr[0]=BIG -> skip candidate? 
                 i0: min_so_far becomes 1 (from dp_prev[0]=1)
                 i1: candidate=1*2+1=3 -> set to 3 -> then min_so_far = min(1,1)=1 -> remains 1.
                 i2: candidate=1*2+0=2 -> set to 2 -> skip update (because 0) -> min_so_far=1.
                 i3: candidate=1*2+0=2 -> set to 2 -> skip update -> min_so_far=1.
                 i4: candidate=1*2+1=3 -> set to 3 -> update min_so_far=min(1,1)=1.
                 i5: candidate=1*2+0=2 -> set to 2 -> skip update -> min_so_far=1.
                 i6: candidate=1*2+1=3 -> set to 3 -> update min_so_far=1.

              j=3: 
                 dp_prev = [1,3,2,2,3,2,3]
                 i0: candidate: skip -> update min_so_far=1 (from dp_prev[0]=1)
                 i1: candidate=1*2+1=3 -> set to 3 -> update min_so_far=min(1,3)=1.
                 i2: candidate=1*2+0=2 -> set to 2 -> update min_so_far=min(1,2)=1.
                 i3: candidate=1*2+0=2 -> set to 2 -> update min_so_far=min(1,2)=1.
                 i4: candidate=1*2+1=3 -> set to 3 -> update min_so_far=min(1,3)=1.
                 i5: candidate=1*2+0=2 -> set to 2 -> update min_so_far=min(1,2)=1.
                 i6: candidate=1*2+1=3 -> set to 3 -> update min_so_far=1.

              j=4: 
                 dp_prev = [1,3,2,2,3,2,3] -> but wait, for j=3 we built: 
                    at i0: we set min_so_far=1? then for i0: we set candidate? no, we skip candidate? 
                    Actually, we don't set a candidate at i0? because we extend from a state at an index <0? 
                    Then we update min_so_far at i0: dp_prev[0]=1 -> min_so_far=1.

                    i1: candidate = 1*2+1=3 -> set to 3 -> update min_so_far=min(1,3)=1.
                    i2: candidate=1*2+0=2 -> set to 2 -> update: skip dp_prev[2]=2? because we skip zeros? no, 2 is non-zero -> min_so_far=min(1,2)=1.
                    i3: candidate=1*2+0=2 -> set to 2 -> update: min_so_far=min(1,2)=1.
                    i4: candidate=1*2+1=3 -> set to 3 -> update: min_so_far=min(1,3)=1.
                    i5: candidate=1*2+0=2 -> set to 2 -> update: min_so_far=min(1,2)=1.
                    i6: candidate=1*2+1=3 -> set to 3 -> update: min_so_far=min(1,3)=1.

                 Then we have for j=4: 
                    dp_curr = [BIG, 3,2,2,3,2,3]

                 Then we check: 3,2,2,3,2,3: any <=13? yes -> output 3.

          Therefore, we output 3.

  But wait: the sample expected output is 3? 

  However, note: the problem says we removed 3 bits to get "1101", which is 13. 
        But we also found a subsequence of length 4 that is 2? which is 2? 
        Actually, we have multiple possibilities? 

        But we break at the largest L? which is 4? 

        So we output 3.

  Therefore, the code is correct.

  We'll submit.

  Note: we are using unsigned long long for the entire state values.

  Let me run the sample with a very large K? 
      K = (1ULL<<60) - 1, and S is a string of 60 ones? 
        Then the entire string is 2^60-1? which is K? so we break at L=60 and output 0.

      How long does it take? 
          We do L from 60 down to 60: 
              j from 1 to 60: 
                  j=1: base state: 60 ones -> 1's.
                  j=2: we compute 60 states: each state is 1*2+1=3? 
                  j=3: 1*2+1=3 -> then 3*2+1=7? 
                  ... 
                  j=60: we compute the entire string? 

          But the state values: 
              j: the value is 2^j - 1.

          For j=60: the value is 2^60-1? which is <=K? 

          Therefore, we break and output 0.

      The computation: 
          We do about 60*60 = 3600 iterations? which is acceptable.

  But note: what if the entire string is 60 ones and K = 2^60? 
          Then the entire string is 2^60-1? <=K? -> break at L=60.

  What if K = 2^60? 
          Then the entire string is 2^60-1? <=K? -> break at L=60.

  What if K = 2^60-1? -> same.

  What if K = 2^60-2? 
          Then the entire string is 2^60-1? which is >K? so we skip.

          Then we try L=59: 
             The minimal value for a subsequence of length 59: we want to remove one one? 
                then the value is 2^59-1? 
                which is 5.76e17? and K=2^60-2 = about 1.15e18? -> 5.76e17 <= 1.15e18? yes.

          Then we break and output 1.

          But wait: we can also form a subsequence that is not the entire string? 
             We can form any subsequence of 59 ones? 

          Then we break at L=59? output 1.

  Therefore, the code.

  We'll run the provided samples and hope.

  Note: the constraints: n<=60, and K up to 2^60, so we use unsigned long long.

  However, note: the multiplication by 2 might cause overflow? 
        But we have: 
          candidate = min_so_far * 2 + bit_val

        min_so_far is at most K (which is <= 2^60) -> then candidate <= 2*K+1, which is at most 2^(61)+1, which is less than 2^64? so it fits.

  Therefore, we are safe.

  Final code:
