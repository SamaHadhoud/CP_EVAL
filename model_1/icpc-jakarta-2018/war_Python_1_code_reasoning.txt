 We are given: N, M, Q
 Then N lines: artillery positions (x_i, y_i) with y_i > 0
 Then M lines: walls (x1, x2, y) with y > 0 and x1 < x2, and no two walls share a common point.
 Then Q lines: query watchtower positions (x_k, y_k) with y_k < 0.

 We note that M is at most 5, so we can precompute for each artillery the walls that are below it (y_wall < y_artillery).

 However, the naive approach of iterating for each query over each artillery and then over the walls below that artillery would be O(N*M*Q) = 40000 * 5 * 40000 = 8e9, which is too slow in Python.

 We need a more efficient solution.

 Alternate approach:

 We can use the idea of "shadows" cast by the walls from the watchtower. For a fixed watchtower T = (x_t, y_t) and a wall j at height y_j, the wall will block the view to any artillery that lies in the cone defined by the two lines from T to the endpoints (x1, y_j) and (x2, y_j). However, note that the artillery must be above the wall (y_a > y_j) to be blocked by that wall.

 Instead, we can precompute for each artillery and for each wall below it a key that represents the "blocking condition" for that wall. However, we cannot avoid iterating over artilleries for each query if we do a naive check.

 Alternatively, we can use the following:

 For a given watchtower T = (x_t, y_t) and a wall j at (x1, x2, y_j), the wall j will block an artillery A = (x_a, y_a) if and only if:
   The line segment TA intersects the wall. But note: we are only concerned with the wall at height y_j. Since the wall is a horizontal segment, we can compute the x-coordinate where the line from T to A crosses the wall's height.

 Specifically, the line from T = (x_t, y_t) to A = (x_a, y_a) crosses the horizontal line y = y_j at a point (x, y_j) where:

   x = (x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a * (y_j - y_t)) / (y_a - y_t)

 However, to avoid floating point, we can use cross-multiplication.

 But note: we have multiple walls per artillery, and we want to know if any wall in the artillery's below-walls list blocks it.

 However, the problem with the naive O(N*M*Q) is the large constant factor (40000 * 5 * 40000 = 8e9 operations) which is too heavy in Python.

 We must optimize per query.

 Idea:

 Instead of iterating over artilleries for each query, we can precompute the angular information for each artillery relative to the walls and then for the query, we can check the angular position relative to the walls? But the walls are fixed and the watchtower moves.

 Alternatively, we can use the following:

 For a fixed watchtower and a fixed wall, we can compute two lines: from T to the two endpoints of the wall. Then, an artillery A is blocked by this wall (if the wall is below A) if and only if A lies between these two lines? But note: we are only concerned with the wall at its y-coordinate. Actually, the condition is: the crossing point of the line TA with the wall's y must lie between the endpoints of the wall.

 However, we can precompute for each artillery the set of walls that are below it. Then, for each query, we want to quickly count the artilleries that are not blocked by any wall in their respective set.

 How to avoid iterating over all artilleries per query?

 We note that the blocking condition for an artillery A by a wall j (which is below A) for a watchtower T is:

   Let base = y_a - y_t (which is positive because y_a > 0 and y_t < 0 -> base = positive)
   The x-coordinate of the intersection of the line TA with the wall at height y_j is:

        x_int = (x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a * (y_j - y_t)) / (y_a - y_t)

   But we can avoid division by multiplying through by base? Actually, we can compare without division:

        w.x1 * (y_a - y_t) <= x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a * (y_j - y_t) <= w.x2 * (y_a - y_t)

   However, note: base = (y_a - y_t) is positive, so the inequalities are preserved.

 Therefore, we can define for each artillery A and for each wall j below it, the condition for being blocked by wall j from T is:

        L_j(A, T) = (x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a * (y_j - y_t))   must lie in the interval [ w.x1 * (y_a - y_t), w.x2 * (y_a - y_t) ]

 But note: the same condition must be checked for each wall j in the set for A.

 However, we cannot avoid iterating over artilleries per query? Actually, we can try to precompute for each artillery the set of walls that block it for a given query? But the query is arbitrary.

 Alternatively, we can invert the problem: For each wall j, we can define a condition on the watchtower T and artillery A such that T and A are separated by wall j. Then, an artillery A is visible from T if and only if for every wall j below A, the condition fails.

 But then we have to combine conditions for multiple walls per artillery.

 Since M is at most 5, we can think of using state-space of walls: There are at most 2^(M) states? But note: each artillery has a set of walls below it, which is a subset of the M walls. Then we can group artilleries by the set of walls below them. There are at most 2^M = 32 groups.

 Then, for each group (by the set S of walls below), we store the artilleries in that group.

 Now, for a fixed watchtower T and a fixed wall j, we can define a halfplane condition: 

   For an artillery A in a group that contains wall j, we require that the x_int is either to the left of w.x1 or to the right of w.x2 to avoid blocking.

   Actually, the condition for not being blocked by wall j is:

        x_int < w.x1 * (y_a - y_t)   OR   x_int > w.x2 * (y_a - y_t)

   But note: we are using integer arithmetic and the entire expression is an integer? We can rearrange:

        (x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a * (y_j - y_t)) < w.x1 * (y_a - y_t)   OR   ... > w.x2 * (y_a - y_t)

   This can be rewritten as:

        (x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a * (y_j - y_t) - w.x1 * (y_a - y_t)) < 0   OR
        (x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a * (y_j - y_t) - w.x2 * (y_a - y_t)) > 0

   Let me define for a fixed artillery A and wall j:

        F_j(A, T) = (x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a * (y_j - y_t) - w.x1 * (y_a - y_t))
        G_j(A, T) = (x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a * (y_j - y_t) - w.x2 * (y_a - y_t))

   Then the condition for not being blocked by wall j is: F_j(A, T) < 0 OR G_j(A, T) > 0.

 However, note: we can rearrange the expression for F_j:

        = x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a * (y_j - y_t) - w.x1 * (y_a - y_t)
        = x_t * (y_a - y_j) - w.x1 * (y_a - y_t) + x_a * (y_j - y_t)

        = x_t * (y_a - y_j) - w.x1 * (y_a - y_t) + x_a * (y_j - y_t)

   Alternatively, we can factor by x_t and x_a:

        = x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a * (y_j - y_t) - w.x1 * (y_a - y_t)
        = x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a * (y_j - y_t) - w.x1 * (y_a - y_t)

   This is linear in (x_t, x_a) and also involves y_t, y_a, and the wall parameters.

 But note: we are going to fix the artillery A and the wall j, and then the query T (x_t, y_t) is the variable. So we can write:

        F_j(A, T) = (y_a - y_j) * x_t + (y_j - y_t) * x_a - w.x1 * (y_a - y_t)

        But note: (y_j - y_t) * x_a is a constant for fixed A? Actually, no: because y_t is the variable.

   Actually, we can rearrange:

        F_j(A, T) = (y_a - y_j) * x_t + (y_j - y_t) * x_a - w.x1 * (y_a - y_t)
                  = (y_a - y_j) * x_t + x_a * y_j - x_a * y_t - w.x1 * y_a + w.x1 * y_t
                  = (y_a - y_j) * x_t - (x_a) * y_t + w.x1 * y_t + [x_a * y_j - w.x1 * y_a]
                  = (y_a - y_j) * x_t + (w.x1 - x_a) * y_t + (x_a * y_j - w.x1 * y_a)

   Similarly, for G_j:

        G_j(A, T) = (y_a - y_j) * x_t + (y_j - y_t) * x_a - w.x2 * (y_a - y_t)
                  = (y_a - y_j) * x_t + (w.x2 - x_a) * y_t + (x_a * y_j - w.x2 * y_a)

   So we have:

        F_j(A, T) = (y_a - y_j) * x_t + (w.x1 - x_a) * y_t + (x_a * y_j - w.x1 * y_a)
        G_j(A, T) = (y_a - y_j) * x_t + (w.x2 - x_a) * y_t + (x_a * y_j - w.x2 * y_a)

   Then the condition for not being blocked by wall j is: F_j(A, T) < 0 OR G_j(A, T) > 0.

   And the artillery A is visible from T if for every wall j in the set S (the walls below A) this condition holds.

   But note: the condition is an OR of two linear inequalities in T. Therefore, for a fixed artillery A, the condition is a logical AND over j in S of (a condition that is the OR of two halfplanes).

   This is a conjunction of disjunctions. The entire condition for A is the intersection of regions that are the union of two halfplanes per wall.

   How can we count the artilleries that satisfy the condition for a fixed T without iterating over all artilleries?

   Since M is at most 5 and the set S for an artillery is a subset of at most 5 walls, and the entire group of artilleries is defined by the set S (which has at most 32 groups), we can try to do the following:

        Precompute for each group (by set S) the list of artilleries in that group.

        For each group, we have a condition: for each wall j in S, we require (F_j < 0 OR G_j > 0).

        Then, for a fixed query T, we can iterate over the groups (at most 32). For each group, we want to count the artilleries A in that group that satisfy: for all j in S: (F_j(A,T) < 0 OR G_j(A,T) > 0).

        But then we would still iterate over all artilleries? Actually, we can precompute for each group and for each wall j in the group, we can index the artilleries by the values of the linear functions? However, the query T is arbitrary and the linear functions are in (x_t, y_t).

        Alternatively, we can precompute for each group and for each wall j, two conditions: one for F_j and one for G_j. But the condition for an artillery A in the group is a disjunction for each wall, so we cannot simply break it down.

   However, note: the condition for a fixed wall j is independent of the other walls? Actually, no: we require the condition for every wall in S.

   We could use a transformation: an artillery A in group S is blocked by one of the walls j in S if there exists j in S such that the blocking condition holds (the opposite of the condition we want). Then, by inclusion-exclusion we could count the artilleries that are blocked? But then we would have to do inclusion-exclusion over the subsets of S, and there are 2^|S| per group, which is 2^(5) = 32 per group? Then we have groups of sets S and then over subsets of S? The total groups are 32, and for each group we have 2^|S| subsets? So total 32*32 = 1024? Then for each query, we do 1024 set operations? But then we have to do inclusion-exclusion for each group.

   Alternatively, we can use the following:

        For a fixed group S and a fixed query T, we can precompute a segment tree or a Fenwick tree for the artilleries in the group? But the conditions are linear in the parameters of A? And we have two conditions per wall per artillery? And the query T is arbitrary.

   This seems complicated.

 Given the complexity of the problem and the constraints (N, Q up to 40000, M up to 5), the intended solution in C++ is O(N*M*Q) and that is acceptable in C++ (8e9 operations in C++ might be borderline in 1s on a fast machine, but in Python it is too slow).

 Therefore, we must optimize the inner loop.

 How about:

   Precompute for each artillery A the list of walls below it (as before).

   Then for each query T, we iterate over artilleries A, and for each wall j in the precomputed list for A, we check:

        L = (x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a * (y_j - y_t))
        base = y_a - y_t   (positive)

        Then check if L is in the interval [ w.x1 * base, w.x2 * base ]

   We can avoid division by comparing:

        w.x1 * base <= L <= w.x2 * base

   But note: we must be cautious about the sign of base? base is positive because y_a>0 and y_t<0 -> base = y_a - y_t > 0.

   So the condition for blocking by wall j is:

        L >= w.x1 * base and L <= w.x2 * base

   We can compute L and base as 64-bit integers? The values: x_t, x_a, y_j, y_t, y_a, w.x1, w.x2 are up to 10^6.

        base = (y_a - y_t) -> up to 10^6 - (-10^6) = 2e6.

        L = x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a * (y_j - y_t)

        The terms: x_t * (y_a - y_j) -> |x_t| up to 1e6, |y_a - y_j| up to 1e6, so absolute value up to 1e12.
        Similarly, x_a * (y_j - y_t) -> |x_a| up to 1e6, |y_j - y_t| up to 1e6 (since y_j>0 and y_t<0, so y_j - y_t can be up to 2e6) -> absolute value up to 2e12.

        Therefore, L can be as large as 3e12 in absolute value? Actually, worst-case: 
            x_t = 10^6, (y_a - y_j) = 10^6 -> 10^12
            x_a = 10^6, (y_j - y_t) = 10^6 - (-10^6) = 2e6 -> 2e12
            Then L = 10^12 + 2e12 = 3e12 -> which is within 64-bit integer (since 3e12 is about 3*10^12, and 2^63 is about 9e18).

        Similarly, base = 2e6, then w.x1 * base and w.x2 * base: w.x1 and w.x2 are in [-10^6, 10^6], so |w.x1 * base| <= 10^6 * 2e6 = 2e12.

        So we can use 64-bit integers.

   However, the naive O(N*M*Q) is 40000 * 5 * 40000 = 8e9 operations, which in Python might be too slow (each operation is a few integer operations, but 8e9 is about 10 seconds in PyPy and much worse in CPython).

 Therefore, we need to optimize further.

 Alternate approach for the entire problem:

   We can note that the condition for an artillery A to be visible is independent of other artilleries. But we cannot avoid iterating over artilleries? 

   However, we can try to precompute for each artillery the entire set of watchtowers that see it? That would be O(N*Q) which is 40000*40000 = 1.6e9, which is too heavy.

   We can also consider: for each wall j, we can compute the set of artilleries that are blocked by wall j from a given watchtower T? But then we have to combine over walls.

   How about: 
        We want to count the artilleries that are visible: total N minus the ones blocked by at least one wall.

        Then by inclusion-exclusion: 

            |blocked| = sum_{nonempty J subset of the M walls} (-1)^(|J|+1) * |blocked by every wall in J|

        But note: an artillery A can only be blocked by walls that are below it. So for a fixed artillery A, the set J must be a subset of S_A (the set of walls below A).

        Then for a fixed watchtower T, we can iterate over the nonempty subsets J of the M walls? But M is 5, so there are 31 subsets.

        For a fixed subset J, we want to count the artilleries A such that:
            (1) J is a subset of S_A (so A must be in a group S that contains J).
            (2) For every wall j in J, the line of sight from T to A is blocked by wall j.

        Condition (2) for a fixed artillery A and a fixed wall j: we have the condition:

            L_j = x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a * (y_j - y_t)   is in [ w_j.x1 * base, w_j.x2 * base ]

        But for multiple walls? We require that for every j in J, the above condition holds.

        However, note: the condition for different walls j are independent? Actually, they are, but they are defined on the same artillery A and the same watchtower T.

        Then, for a fixed subset J, we want to count the artilleries A that are in groups that contain J (so that S_A contains J) and for every j in J, 

            w_j.x1 * (y_a - y_t) <= x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a * (y_j - y_t) <= w_j.x2 * (y_a - y_t)

        This is a system of |J| linear inequalities in the parameters of A (x_a, y_a) and also the query T (x_t, y_t). 

        We can precompute for each subset J the list of artilleries that have S_A containing J. Then for a query T, we iterate over the 31 subsets and for each subset, we iterate over the artilleries in the list for J that satisfy the system of |J| inequalities? That would be O(31 * (number of artilleries in the list for J)) per query, which is worse than the naive.

        But note: we can precompute for each subset J a data structure (like a KD-tree?) for the artilleries? But |J| is at most 5, and we have 32 groups, but the artilleries are fixed and the query T is arbitrary. The condition is linear in (x_a, y_a) but nonlinear in T? Actually, we can rearrange the condition for a fixed wall j:

            (x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a * (y_j - y_t)) - w_j.x1 * (y_a - y_t) >= 0   and
            w_j.x2 * (y_a - y_t) - (x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a * (y_j - y_t)) >= 0

        But these are linear in x_a and y_a? Actually, they are affine in x_a and y_a, but the coefficients depend on T and the wall.

        Specifically, condition for wall j:

            (x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a * (y_j - y_t)) >= w_j.x1 * (y_a - y_t)
            => (x_t * y_a - x_t * y_j + x_a * y_j - x_a * y_t) - w_j.x1 * y_a + w_j.x1 * y_t >= 0
            => (x_t * y_a - w_j.x1 * y_a) + (x_a * y_j) - x_a * y_t + ( - x_t * y_j + w_j.x1 * y_t) >= 0
            => y_a * (x_t - w_j.x1) + x_a * (y_j - y_t) - (x_t * y_j - w_j.x1 * y_t) >= 0

        Similarly, the other condition:

            w_j.x2 * (y_a - y_t) - (x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a * (y_j - y_t)) >= 0
            => (w_j.x2 * y_a - w_j.x2 * y_t) - (x_t * y_a - x_t * y_j + x_a * y_j - x_a * y_t) >= 0
            => y_a * (w_j.x2 - x_t) + x_a * (y_t - y_j) + (x_t * y_j - w_j.x2 * y_t) >= 0

        So we have two inequalities per wall j:

            A1_j * y_a + B1_j * x_a + C1_j >= 0
            A2_j * y_a + B2_j * x_a + C2_j >= 0

        where the coefficients A1_j, B1_j, C1_j, A2_j, B2_j, C2_j are functions of T and the wall j.

        Then for a fixed J, we have 2*|J| inequalities.

        How to count artilleries in a set that satisfy 2*|J| inequalities quickly? And we have to do it for each query and for each subset J? 

        This seems even more complex.

 Given the complexity of the inclusion-exclusion and the data structure needed, and the fact that M is only 5 and the worst-case groups are 32, we might consider the following:

        Precompute the groups: for each subset S (which is a bitmask of the walls that are below the artillery), we store a list of artilleries.

        Then for each query T, we iterate over the groups (at most 32). For each group with set S, we iterate over the artilleries in the group and check the condition for each wall j in S: that is, for each artillery in the group, we check for every wall j in S: 

            w_j.x1 * base <= L_j <= w_j.x2 * base

        Then if it passes for all walls in S, we count this artillery.

        The total work per query = sum_{groups} (|group| * |S_group|)

        Since |S_group| is the size of the set for that group (at most 5), the work per query is at most 5 * N.

        And then over Q queries: 5 * N * Q = 5 * 40000 * 40000 = 8e9, which is too slow in Python.

 Therefore, we must optimize the inner loop by not iterating over every artillery per group per query.

 How can we do that?

   For a fixed group (with fixed set S) and fixed query T, we want to count the artilleries A in the group such that for all j in S:

        w_j.x1 * (y_a - y_t) <= x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a * (y_j - y_t) <= w_j.x2 * (y_a - y_t)

   Rearranged for a fixed wall j:

        (x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a * (y_j - y_t)) - w_j.x1 * (y_a - y_t) >= 0
        w_j.x2 * (y_a - y_t) - (x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a * (y_j - y_t)) >= 0

   But as we saw, these are linear in x_a and y_a. Therefore, for a fixed group and fixed query T and fixed wall j, the condition defines a polygon in the (x_a, y_a) plane. The conjunction over j in S defines the intersection of |S| such polygons (each polygon is defined by two halfplanes). 

   We can compute the intersection polygon for the group for this query? But the query T is arbitrary, and we have to do it for each query and each group (32 groups) and then do point location for each artillery in the group? That is not efficient.

   Alternatively, we can precompute for each group a data structure over the artilleries in the group. But the conditions change with T.

   Given the time constraints, and the fact that M is very small (at most 5) and the groups are 32, the total artilleries in a group can be large (up to 40000) and we have 40000 queries, so 32 * 40000 * 40000 = 128e9, which is too slow.

 Therefore, we must abandon this and seek a different approach.

 Insight:

   We can note that the condition for an artillery A to be visible from T is that for every wall j below A, the point (x_a, y_a) does not lie in the "shadow" of the wall j from T. The shadow of wall j from T is the cone defined by the two rays from T to the endpoints of the wall. Then, the condition is that A must not lie in the convex cone of the wall j.

   But note: the cone is not convex in the usual sense, but it is a double wedge. Actually, the region blocked by the wall is the set of points that are on the far side of the wall and that are between the two rays.

   We can precompute for each wall j two rays: the ray from T to (x1, y_j) and the ray from T to (x2, y_j). Then an artillery A is blocked by wall j if and only if it is on the opposite side of the wall and the ray from T to A lies between the ray to (x1, y_j) and the ray to (x2, y_j).

   How to check that quickly? We can use cross products.

   For a fixed wall j and a fixed T, define:

        v1 = (x1 - x_t, y_j - y_t)   -> vector from T to (x1, y_j)
        v2 = (x2 - x_t, y_j - y_t)   -> vector from T to (x2, y_j)
        vA = (x_a - x_t, y_a - y_t)   -> vector from T to A

   Then, the artillery A is between the two rays if and only if the ray vA is between v1 and v2. We can check this with cross products:

        cross(v1, vA) >= 0 and cross(vA, v2) >= 0   if the rays are in counter-clockwise order? But we must be cautious: the wall might be in any orientation relative to T.

   Actually, we can define the two rays in sorted angular order. We can compute the angle of v1 and v2 relative to the positive x-axis? But that is expensive.

   Alternatively, we can check:

        cross(v1, vA) * cross(v1, v2) >= 0   and   cross(vA, v2) * cross(v1, v2) >= 0   and then the absolute condition that vA is between v1 and v2 in the same rotational order.

   But note: if we consider the rays in the direction away from T, then the cone is the set of points for which the vector vA is a convex combination of v1 and v2 with nonnegative coefficients? No, it's the set of points that are on the same side of the line T->(x1,y_j) as the wall's segment and on the same side of the line T->(x2,y_j) as the wall's segment? Actually, the condition is that vA is in the cone defined by v1 and v2.

   We can use:

        cross(v1, vA) >= 0   and   cross(vA, v2) >= 0   and   cross(v1, v2) > 0   [assuming v1 is to the left of v2]

   But if cross(v1, v2) < 0, then the cone wraps around, so we would require the opposite? 

   Instead, we can do: the point A is in the cone if the following two conditions hold:
        1. A is to the left of the ray from T through (x1, y_j) when going from v1 to v2 in the counter-clockwise direction? 

   Actually, a simpler method is to note that the cone is the set of points for which the ray vA is between v1 and v2 in the rotational order. We can achieve this by:

        cross(v1, v2) > 0: then we require cross(v1, vA) >= 0 and cross(vA, v2) >= 0.
        cross(v1, v2) < 0: then we require cross(v1, vA) <= 0 and cross(vA, v2) <= 0.

   But wait, if cross(v1, v2) = 0, then the two vectors are colinear, but the wall has x1 < x2, and y_j>0, and T has y_t<0, so the vectors v1 and v2 are not colinear with the origin? Actually, they might be if T is exactly below the wall's endpoints? But the wall is horizontal and T is below, so the two vectors will not be colinear.

   However, let's be safe: if cross(v1, v2)==0, then the wall is degenerate? But the wall has x1 < x2, and the vectors from T to the endpoints: 
        v1 = (x1 - x_t, y_j - y_t)
        v2 = (x2 - x_t, y_j - y_t)
        cross = (x1-x_t)*(y_j-y_t) - (x2-x_t)*(y_j-y_t) = (y_j-y_t) * (x1-x_t - (x2-x_t)) = (y_j-y_t)*(x1-x2) 
        which is negative because x1<x2 and (y_j-y_t) > 0.

   So cross(v1, v2) = (y_j-y_t)*(x1-x2) < 0.

   Therefore, we always have cross(v1, v2) < 0.

   Then the condition for A to be in the cone is: 
        cross(v1, vA) <= 0 and cross(vA, v2) <= 0.

   But note: the cone is the set of points that are on the clockwise side of v1 and on the counter-clockwise side of v2? Actually, because the cross(v1, v2) is negative, the cone from v1 to v2 is the clockwise arc. Therefore, the cone is the set of vectors vA such that the rotation from v1 to v2 passing through the shorter arc (which is clockwise) contains vA. This happens if vA is not in the counter-clockwise arc from v1 to v2, but in the clockwise arc. 

   However, we want the points that are between v1 and v2 in the clockwise order. This is equivalent to: the point A should be to the right of the directed line from T to (x1,y_j) and to the left of the directed line from T to (x2,y_j)? 

   Let me test with a sample: 
        T = (0,-5), wall: (5,20,5) -> endpoints (5,5) and (20,5).
        v1 = (5,10), v2 = (20,10) -> cross(v1, v2) = 5*10 - 20*10 = 50-200 = -150 <0.
        Consider artillery at (0,2): 
            vA = (0-0, 2-(-5)) = (0,7)
            cross(v1, vA) = 5*7 - 10*0 = 35 >0 -> fails the condition "cross(v1, vA)<=0".

        But (0,2) should be visible? Actually, in the sample, it is visible.

        Consider artillery at (5,7): 
            vA = (5-0, 7-(-5)) = (5,12)
            cross(v1, vA) = 5*12 - 10*5 = 60-50 = 10 >0 -> not in the cone.

        Consider artillery at (0,15): 
            vA = (0,20)
            cross(v1, vA) = 5*20 - 10*0 = 100 >0 -> not in the cone.

        Consider artillery at (45,10): 
            vA = (45,15)
            cross(v1, vA) = 5*15 - 10*45 = 75 - 450 = -375 <0 
            cross(vA, v2) = 45*10 - 15*20 = 450-300 = 150 >0 -> so we require both to be <=0? then it fails.

        But (45,10) is visible from (0,-5) in the sample.

        Now consider an artillery that should be blocked: the sample says (0,-5) can see (0,2), (0,15), (5,7), (45,10) -> so none of the artilleries in the sample are blocked by the first wall for this watchtower.

        How about an artillery at (10,6): 
            vA = (10,11)
            cross(v1, vA) = 5*11 - 10*10 = 55-100 = -45 <0
            cross(vA, v2) = 10*10 - 11*20 = 100-220 = -120 <0
            -> then it would be in the cone.

        So (10,6) should be blocked.

   Therefore, the condition using cross products for a given wall j and watchtower T is:
        Let v1 = (x1 - x_t, y_j - y_t)
        Let v2 = (x2 - x_t, y_j - y_t)
        Let vA = (x_a - x_t, y_a - y_t)
        Then the artillery A is blocked by wall j if and only if:
            cross(v1, vA) <= 0 and cross(vA, v2) <= 0   [because we know cross(v1, v2) <0]

   But note: this is only for the wall j and the watchtower T. However, we also require that the artillery is on the far side of the wall: but note that if the artillery is below the wall, then it wouldn't be in the group for this wall. Since we only consider walls that are below the artillery, we have y_a > y_j, so the artillery is on the far side.

   Therefore, for an artillery A in the group for wall j, it is blocked by wall j if and only if:
        cross(v1, vA) <= 0 and cross(vA, v2) <= 0.

   Then for a given artillery A and a given watchtower T, we can check for each wall j in the group S_A: 
        if cross(v1, vA) > 0 or cross(vA, v2) > 0, then it is not blocked by wall j.
        if for every wall j in S_A, it is not blocked by wall j, then the artillery is visible.

   The cross product conditions:
        cross(v1, vA) = (x1 - x_t)*(y_a - y_t) - (y_j - y_t)*(x_a - x_t)
        cross(vA, v2) = (x_a - x_t)*(y_j - y_t) - (y_a - y_t)*(x2 - x_t)

   And then we can check: 
        if (x1 - x_t)*(y_a - y_t) > (y_j - y_t)*(x_a - x_t)   OR   (x_a - x_t)*(y_j - y_t) > (y_a - y_t)*(x2 - x_t) 
        then the artillery is not blocked by wall j.

   But note: these are exactly the conditions we had before? 

   Let me compare with the condition using the intersection point:

        We had: 
            L = x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a * (y_j - y_t)
            base = y_a - y_t
            blocked if: w.x1 * base <= L <= w.x2 * base

        Let me rearrange the first part of the cross product condition:

            cross(v1, vA) = (x1 - x_t)*(y_a - y_t) - (y_j - y_t)*(x_a - x_t)
                           = x1*(y_a - y_t) - x_t*(y_a - y_t) - (y_j - y_t)*x_a + (y_j - y_t)*x_t
                           = [x1*(y_a - y_t) + x_t*(y_j - y_t)] - [x_t*(y_a - y_t) + x_a*(y_j - y_t)] 
                           = [x1*(y_a - y_t) + x_t*(y_j - y_t)] - L

        So the condition cross(v1, vA) > 0 is equivalent to:
            x1*(y_a - y_t) + x_t*(y_j - y_t) - L > 0 
            => L < x1*(y_a - y_t) + x_t*(y_j - y_t)   [but note: this is not obviously the same]

   Alternatively, we can use the cross product method to reimplement the condition, but we must be cautious that the cross product condition we derived is for the cone, and the sample condition using the intersection point is also valid.

   However, the cross product method is also valid and passed the sample test with (10,6) being blocked.

   But we already have an condition using integer arithmetic that does not use cross products? It is the same: we had the condition for blocking by a wall j is:

        L = x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a * (y_j - y_t)
        base = y_a - y_t
        and then check if L is in [ w.x1 * base, w.x2 * base ]

   This is algebraically equivalent to the cross product condition? Let me see:

        cross(v1, vA) = (x1 - x_t)*(y_a - y_t) - (y_j - y_t)*(x_a - x_t)
                      = x1*(y_a - y_t) - x_t*(y_a - y_t) - x_a*(y_j - y_t) + x_t*(y_j - y_t)
                      = x1*(y_a - y_t) + x_t*(y_j - y_t) - [x_t*(y_a - y_t) + x_a*(y_j - y_t)]
                      = x1*base + x_t*(y_j - y_t) - L

        So cross(v1, vA) = x1*base + x_t*(y_j - y_t) - L.

        Then cross(v1, vA) > 0  <==>  L < x1*base + x_t*(y_j - y_t)   [which is not the same as L < w.x1 * base].

   Therefore, the two conditions are different. Why?

   Actually, the cross product condition we derived is for the cone in the plane, and the condition using the intersection point is also for the cone. They must be equivalent. 

   Let me derive the condition using the intersection point again:

        The parametric representation of the line from T=(x_t, y_t) to A=(x_a, y_a) is:
            x = x_t + t * (x_a - x_t)
            y = y_t + t * (y_a - y_t)

        We want to know if this line passes through the wall (which is at y=y_j) at an x between x1 and x2.

        Solve for t: 
            y_t + t * (y_a - y_t) = y_j   => t = (y_j - y_t) / (y_a - y_t)

        Then x = x_t + (y_j - y_t)/(y_a - y_t) * (x_a - x_t)
              = [x_t * (y_a - y_t) + (x_a - x_t) * (y_j - y_t)] / (y_a - y_t)
              = [x_t * (y_a - y_t) + x_a*(y_j - y_t) - x_t*(y_j - y_t)] / (y_a - y_t)
              = [x_t * (y_a - y_t - (y_j - y_t)) + x_a*(y_j - y_t)] / (y_a - y_t)
              = [x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a*(y_j - y_t)] / (y_a - y_t)

        So x = L / base.

        And then we require: x1 <= x <= x2.

        Multiply by base (which is positive): x1 * base <= L <= x2 * base.

   So the condition using L is correct.

   Why then is the cross product condition different? 

   Because the cross product condition we used for the cone was intended to be a geometric condition for the point A being in the cone, but it is not obviously the same as the condition on the intersection point.

   However, they are equivalent. How to see it?

        The condition that the intersection point x falls in [x1, x2] is equivalent to the point A being in the cone defined by the two rays from T to (x1,y_j) and to (x2,y_j). 

   Therefore, we have two valid conditions. 

   Given that the condition with L and base is more straightforward (and we already have it implemented in C++ and it passed the sample), we will use that.

   Now, how to speed up the O(N*M*Q) in Python?

   We might try to use PyPy or hope that input/output is fast, but 8e9 operations in Python is not feasible.

   We need to optimize by orders of magnitude.

   Another idea: offline queries by wall? 

   Since M is only 5, we might for each wall j, precompute the set of artilleries that are above it (which is group by at least containing j) and then for each query, we want to know for each artillery in the group whether it is blocked by wall j.

   Then for a fixed wall j, the condition for an artillery A to be blocked by wall j from watchtower T is:

        L = x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a * (y_j - y_t)
        base = y_a - y_t
        and then check: w_j.x1 * base <= L <= w_j.x2 * base.

   This is a linear condition in x_t and y_t, but also involves x_a and y_a.

   For a fixed artillery A and fixed wall j, the condition is linear in (x_t, y_t). Specifically:

        L = x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a * (y_j - y_t)
           = x_t * c1 + y_t * c2 + c3

   where c1 = (y_a - y_j), c2 = -x_a, c3 = x_a * y_j

   and then the condition is:

        w_j.x1 * (y_a - y_t) <= L <= w_j.x2 * (y_a - y_t)

        => w_j.x1 * (y_a - y_t) <= x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a * (y_j - y_t) <= w_j.x2 * (y_a - y_t)

   This is two linear inequalities in (x_t, y_t).

   Then for a fixed wall j and fixed artillery A, the condition is a axis-aligned rectangle in the (x_t, y_t) space? No, it's two halfplanes.

   For a fixed wall j, we want to know for a given query T, the artilleries A in the group for wall j that are blocked by wall j. 

   If we treat each artillery A for wall j as a point in a space indexed by (x_t, y_t), then the condition for A to be blocked by wall j defines a polygon in (x_t, y_t) space. We want to count, for a given T, the artilleries A for which T is in that polygon.

   But note: the polygon is defined by two lines, so it is a region between two lines.

   Then, for a fixed wall j, we can gather all artilleries in the group for wall j and for each such artillery, we have a region in (x_t, y_t) space (a slab defined by two lines) where if the query T falls in that region, then artillery A is blocked by wall j from T.

   Then, for a fixed wall j, we want to answer: for a given query T, how many artilleries A in the group for wall j have T in their region? 

   This is a range counting query in a arrangement of lines? We can offline the queries and use a sweep-line and a Fenwick tree? But the region is not a axis-aligned rectangle.

   Specifically, the condition for a fixed artillery A and wall j is: 

        w_j.x1 * (y_a - y_t) <= x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a * (y_j - y_t) <= w_j.x2 * (y_a - y_t)

   Rearranged for the first inequality:

        x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a * (y_j - y_t) - w_j.x1 * (y_a - y_t) >= 0

   and for the second:

        w_j.x2 * (y_a - y_t) - [x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a * (y_j - y_t)] >= 0

   These are two lines in the (x_t, y_t) space.

   The first inequality: 
        (y_a - y_j) * x_t - (x_a) * y_t + ( x_a * y_j - w_j.x1 * y_a ) + w_j.x1 * y_t >= 0
        -> (y_a - y_j) * x_t + (w_j.x1 - x_a) * y_t + (x_a * y_j - w_j.x1 * y_a) >= 0

   The second inequality:

        - (y_a - y_j) * x_t - (y_j - y_t) * x_a + w_j.x2 * (y_a - y_t) >= 0
        -> - (y_a - y_j) * x_t + (x_a) * y_t - x_a * y_j + w_j.x2 * y_a - w_j.x2 * y_t >= 0
        -> - (y_a - y_j) * x_t + (x_a - w_j.x2) * y_t + (w_j.x2 * y_a - x_a * y_j) >= 0

   This is two lines: 
        line1: a1*x_t + b1*y_t + c1 >= 0
        line2: a2*x_t + b2*y_t + c2 >= 0

   The region for (x_t, y_t) is the intersection of two halfplanes.

   Given a set of artilleries (each defining such a region) and a query point T, we want to count the artilleries for which T falls in their region.

   This is a linear constraint per artillery, and we have to do it for each wall j. 

   How to do that? We can use point location in an arrangement of lines, but the total number of lines is 2 * (number of artilleries in the group for wall j), and the group might have up to 40000 artilleries, so the arrangement would have 80000 lines, which is too many for building the arrangement.

   Given the complexity, and the fact that we have 5 walls, and for each wall we would have to build a data structure for 40000 artilleries (which means 40000*2 = 80000 lines) and then do a point location for 40000 queries, the total preprocessing would be heavy and the constants are high.

 Therefore, after trying several methods, it appears that the intended solution in C++ is the naive double loop over artilleries and walls for each query, and we hope that in C++ it is fast enough. In Python, we must try to optimize as much as possible and hope that the constant factors are low or that the test cases are not the worst-case.

 But 8e9 iterations in Python is about 8e9 * (say) 100 ns per iteration = 800 seconds, which is too slow.

 However, note that the worst-case might not be achived because groups are not necessarily containing all artilleries. In the worst-case, every artillery might have all 5 walls below it, then the work is 5 * N * Q = 8e9.

 We must try to reduce the constant factor and use faster I/O.

 Steps to optimize in Python:

   1. Use sys.stdin for input.
   2. Precompute and store everything in lists.
   3. For each query, iterate over artilleries and for each artillery, iterate over the list of walls below it.
   4. For each wall in the list, do the integer arithmetic.

   But 8e9 iterations is 8e9 iterations, which in C++ is borderline in 1 second (if each iteration is a few operations, then in C++ it might be 8 seconds), in Python it is minutes.

 Given the complexity, we must try to find a better algorithm or hope that the test cases are not worst-case.

 But the sample input only has 6 artilleries and 3 queries, and 2 walls.

 Another idea: can we for each query and for each wall, 

 We return to the group idea: groups are defined by the set of walls below the artillery. There are at most 32 groups. 
   Let group[tuple(S)] = list of artilleries in this group.

   Then for a query T, we do:

        count = 0
        for each group in groups:
            for each artillery A in the group:
                for each wall j in the set S of the group:
                    base = y_a - y_t
                    L = x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a * (y_j - y_t)
                    if w_j.x1 * base <= L <= w_j.x2 * base:
                        then the artillery is blocked by wall j -> break inner loop
                else:
                    count += 1

        output count

   The total work = sum_{groups} (|group| * |S_group|) per query.

   worst-case, if one group has all artilleries and |S_group| = 5, then work = 5 * N * Q = 8e9.

   This is the same as the naive approach.

   However, if the artilleries are distributed among groups, then the work might be lower. But worst-case is still 8e9.

 Given the constraints, we must try to optimize the inner loop in PyPy or with Pyrex, but in pure Python we need a better method.

 After reading the sample input, we note that not every artillery has all walls below it. In the sample, the artilleries are not all in the group with both walls. In fact, the artillery at (0,2) has no wall below it (because the walls are at y=5 and y=10, and 2<5 and 2<10 -> so no wall below? Actually, the condition for a wall to be below the artillery is: y_j < y_a. For (0,2): y_a=2, and the walls have y_j=5 and 10, which are not <2, so the group for (0,2) is empty.

   Therefore, the group for (0,2) has S = empty set, so the inner loop over walls is skipped.

   Similarly, the artilleries at (0,15) and (5,7) have both walls below them? 
        (0,15): y_a=15, walls at y=5 and y=10 are below -> group with both walls.
        (5,7): y_a=7, wall at y=5 is below, wall at y=10 is not (because 10>7) -> group with one wall.

   So the groups have sizes: 
        group_empty: [ (0,2) ]
        group_wall0: [ (5,7) ]   (assuming wall0: (5,20,5) -> y0=5, wall1: (25,40,10) -> y0=10)
        group_wall1: [ ]  (because no artillery has only wall1 below it: because if an artillery has only wall1 below it, then y_a>10 and y_a<=5? no, because wall1 is at 10, so artillery must be above 10 and not have wall0 below it? then it would have wall0 below if it's above 10 then it's also above wall0 (which is at 5), so it would have both walls below) -> then group with both walls: [ (0,15), (15,15), (35,12), (45,10) ]? 
        But (45,10): y_a=10, so wall0 is at 5 (y0=5) is below, wall1 is at 10 -> y0=10, but the artillery is at y=10, and the condition is: we only consider walls with y_j < y_a? 
            The problem: "For each artillery, we precompute a list of walls that are below it (i.e., walls with y-coordinate less than the artillery's y-coordinate)"

        So (45,10): y_a=10, wall0: y0=5 <10 -> included, wall1: y0=10 -> not included.

        Therefore, (45,10) is in group with only wall0.

   So groups:
        group_empty: [ (0,2) ]
        group0: [ (5,7), (45,10) ]
        group1: [ ] 
        group0+1: [ (0,15), (15,15), (35,12) ]

   Then for the first query T=(0,-5), the work per group:
        group_empty: 1 artillery * 0 walls = 0
        group0: 2 artilleries * 1 wall = 2
        group1: 0
        group0+1: 3 artilleries * 2 walls = 6
        total = 0+2+0+6 = 8

   For the next query: similarly.

   In the worst-case, if we have 40000 artilleries in a group with 5 walls, then per query we do 40000 * 5 = 200000, and over 40000 queries: 200000 * 40000 = 8e9.

   This is the same as before.

   Therefore, we must hope that in practice the artilleries are distributed or that the groups with many walls are small.

   But the problem does not guarantee that.

 Given the time, we must implement the group method and hope that the worst-case does not happen or use faster language.

 However, we are to provide a Python solution.

 Let's try to optimize the inner loop in Python as much as possible.

   For a given artillery A and a wall j in its group, we do:

        base = y_a - y_t   (positive)
        L = x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a * (y_j - y_t)
        if L < w_j.x1 * base or L > w_j.x2 * base:
            then not blocked by wall j
        else:
            blocked by wall j -> break

   We can compute these with integers.

   We can try to cache the parameters of the artilleries and walls.

   Also, we can try to not iterate over artilleries that are in groups with empty set.

   But the worst-case group might be the one with 5 walls and 40000 artilleries, and 40000 queries -> 40000 * 40000 * 5 = 8e9.

   This is 8e9 iterations, which in C++ is about 8 seconds, in Python it is minutes.

   We must seek to reduce the constant factor.

   How about: precompute for each artillery in a group the list of walls in that group, and also precompute the parameters of the wall for that group: (y_j, x1, x2) and also for the artillery: (x_a, y_a) and then also we can precompute some values that are constant per artillery and wall? 

   In the inner loop, we need: 
        base = y_a - y_t   (y_t is query-dependent)
        L = x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a * (y_j - y_t)

   We can also precompute for each artillery-wall pair in the group the value (y_a - y_j) and then use:

        L = x_t * (y_a - y_j) + x_a * (y_j - y_t)
           = x_t * c1 + x_a * (y_j - y_t)

   But x_a * (y_j - y_t) = x_a * y_j - x_a * y_t.

   We can precompute for each artillery-wall pair: 
        c1 = y_a - y_j
        c2 = x_a * y_j
        c3 = - x_a   [for the term with y_t]

   Then L = x_t * c1 + c2 + c3 * y_t

   and the condition is:

        w_j.x1 * (y_a - y_t) <= L <= w_j.x2 * (y_a - y_t)

        => w_j.x1 * (y_a - y_t) <= x_t * c1 + c2 + c3 * y_t <= w_j.x2 * (y_a - y_t)

   But then we have to compute (y_a - y_t) which is base = y_a - y_t.

   Alternatively, we can precompute for each artillery-wall pair the following values: 
        A = c1 = y_a - y_j
        B = - x_a   [so that the term with y_t is B * y_t]
        C = c2 = x_a * y_j
        then L = A * x_t + B * y_t + C

   and the condition is:

        w_j.x1 * (y_a - y_t) = w_j.x1 * y_a - w_j.x1 * y_t
        w_j.x2 * (y_a - y_t) = w_j.x2 * y_a - w_j.x2 * y_t

   So the condition becomes:

        w_j.x1 * y_a - w_j.x1 * y_t <= A * x_t + B * y_t + C <= w_j.x2 * y_a - w_j.x2 * y_t

        => 
            (A * x_t + B * y_t + C) - (w_j.x1 * y_a - w_j.x1 * y_t) >= 0
            (w_j.x2 * y_a - w_j.x2 * y_t) - (A * x_t + B * y_t + C) >= 0

   This is two affine functions in (x_t, y_t) for each artillery-wall pair.

   But then we still have to evaluate this for each pair.

   The number of artillery-wall pairs in the entire input is: sum_{artilleries} |group_i| <= N * M = 40000 * 5 = 200000.

   But then per query, for a given group, we have to iterate over the artilleries in the group and for each wall in the group, we do one check.

   The total work per query is the sum over groups of (number of artilleries in the group) * (size of the group's set).

   This is the same as before: it is exactly the number of artillery-wall pairs that exist. And the total over all artilleries is <= 200000, but note: it's per query! And there are 40000 queries.

   Therefore, the work would be 40000 * (number of artillery-wall pairs) = 40000 * 200000 = 8e9, which is the same as before.

   Wait, no: because the artillery-wall pairs are fixed (200000) and for each query we only iterate over the artilleries and for each artillery over its list of walls (which is at most 5), so the total work per query is the total number of artillery-wall pairs in the entire dataset, which is <= 200000.

   Then over 40000 queries, the work is 40000 * 200000 = 8e9.

   Therefore, we cannot avoid the 8e9 in the worst-case.

   But note: the total number of artillery-wall pairs is not 200000, because an artillery can have up to 5 walls, so the total number of artillery-wall pairs is at most 5 * N = 200000.

   And then per query, we are doing for each artillery-wall pair one condition check.

   Therefore, we can reorganized the data by artillery-wall pair and then for each query iterate over all artillery-wall pairs? That would be 200000 per query, and 40000 queries -> 8e9.

   So we are back to 8e9.

 Given the above, and that the intended solution in C++ is O(N*M*Q) and they have 8e9 operations, which in C++ is borderline, in Python we must hope for the best or find a more efficient algorithm.

 One more idea: for each wall j, and for each query T, we want to know the set of artilleries in the group for wall j that are blocked by wall j. This is a necessary condition for the artillery to be not visible. Then, an artillery is not visible if for at least one wall j in its group, it is blocked by wall j.

   Then, the number of visible artilleries = total N - (number of artilleries that are blocked by at least one wall in their group).

   And then by the inclusion-exclusion over walls? 

   But the events are not independent, and the sets for different walls overlap.

   However, we can use a boolean array per query of size N, and for each artillery-wall pair, if the condition for blocking by wall j is true, then mark the artillery as blocked. Then count the unmarked.

   But then we iterate over artillery-wall pairs for each query: 200000 pairs per query, and 40000 queries: 8e9.

   This is the same.

 Therefore, we must implement the double loop and hope that the test data is not worst-case or that the constants are small.

 Given the sample is not worst-case, and perhaps in practice the artilleries in groups with many walls are few, we implement the group method.

 Steps for the group method:

   groups: a dictionary or a list of lists. We will create an array for the group of each artillery, and then also create a list of artilleries for each group (where a group is represented by a bitmask or a tuple of the walls indices).

   But there are up to 32 groups.

   Precomputation:

        groups_by_key = { bitmask: [] for all bitmasks that appear }

        for i in range(N):
            bitmask = 0
            for j in range(M):
                if artilleries[i].y > walls[j].y0:
                    bitmask |= (1 << j)
            groups_by_key[bitmask].append(i)

   Then for each query T = (x_t, y_t):

        visible_count = 0
        for bitmask, art_list in groups_by_key.items():
            # get the list of walls for this group: if bitmask has a bit set at j, then wall j is below the artilleries in this group.
            walls_in_group = []
            for j in range(M):
                if bitmask & (1 << j):
                    walls_in_group.append(j)

            for i in art_list:
                x_a = artilleries[i].x
                y_a = artilleries[i].y
                is_blocked = False
                for j in walls_in_group:
                    wall = walls[j]
                    base = y_a - y_t   # positive
                    # Compute L = x_t * (y_a - wall.y0) + x_a * (wall.y0 - y_t)
                    L = x_t * (y_a - wall.y0) + x_a * (wall.y0 - y_t)
                    if L >= wall.x1 * base and L <= wall.x2 * base:
                        is_blocked = True
                        break
                if not is_blocked:
                    visible_count += 1

        output visible_count

   However, the worst-case group might have 40000 artilleries and 5 walls, and then this group alone would do 40000 * 5 = 200000 per query, and over 40000 queries: 8e9.

   We can try to optimize by precomputing for each group and for each wall in the group a sorted list of something? 

   Alternatively, for a fixed group and fixed wall j, the condition is linear in x_t and y_t, and also in x_a and y_a. We might try to solve with sweeping in the parameters of the query? offline the queries.

   Given the time, and since M is only 5, and the group has fixed artilleries, for a fixed group and fixed wall j, the condition for an artillery A to be blocked by wall j for query T is the condition we had: 

        w_j.x1 * (y_a - y_t) <= x_t * (y_a - wall.y0) + x_a * (wall.y0 - y_t) <= w_j.x2 * (y_a - y_t)

   This can be rearranged to two linear inequalities in (x_t, y_t) (as before) and then for the fixed group and fixed wall j, we have a set of artilleries and we want to know for a given T, which of these artilleries satisfy the condition. This is a range reporting in a dynamic set of points in (x_t, y_t) with half-plane conditions? 

   This is complex.

 Given the complexity, and the fact that the intended solution in C++ is the double loop, and that in C++ it might pass, in Python we might need to use PyPy or hope that the test cases are not worst-case.

 We implement the group method and hope that the groups with many artilleries and many walls are rare.

 Let's run the sample with the group method.

   Groups for the sample:

        artillery: 
          0: (0,2) -> y=2, walls: none -> bitmask=0 -> group0: list0 = [0]
          1: (0,15) -> both walls: 5<15, 10<15 -> bitmask= (1<<0 | 1<<1) = 3 -> group3: list3 = [1]
          2: (5,7) -> wall0: 5<7 -> bitmask=1 -> group1: list1 = [2]
          3: (15,15) -> both walls: bitmask=3 -> group3: list3 = [1,3]
          4: (35,12) -> wall0:5<12, wall1:10<12 -> bitmask=3 -> group3 = [1,3,4]
          5: (45,10) -> wall0:5<10 -> bitmask=1 -> group1 = [2,5]

        groups_by_key:
          0: [0]
          1: [2,5]
          3: [1,3,4]

        For query T0 = (0,-5)

           group0: no walls -> all artilleries in this group are visible: count +=1 (artillery0)
           group1: walls = [0] (wall0: (5,20,5))
                artillery2: (5,7): 
                   base = 7 - (-5) = 12
                   L = 0*(7-5) + 5*(5 - (-5)) = 0 + 5*10 = 50
                   wall0: x1=5, x2=20 -> 5*12=60, 20*12=240 -> 50 not in [60,240] -> not blocked -> count +=1
                artillery5: (45,10):
                   base = 10 - (-5) = 15
                   L = 0*(10-5) + 45*(5 - (-5)) = 0 + 45*10 = 450
                   wall0: 5*15=75, 20*15=300 -> 450 not in [75,300]? 450>300 -> not blocked -> count +=1
                so count from group1: 2

           group3: walls = [0,1] (wall0 and wall1)
                artillery1: (0,15)
                   base = 15-(-5)=20
                   wall0: 
                         L0 = 0*(15-5) + 0*(5 - (-5)) = 0
                         condition: 5*20=100 <= 0<=20*20=400? no -> not blocked by wall0.
                   wall1: wall1: (25,40,10)
                         L1 = 0*(15-10) + 0*(10 - (-5)) = 0
                         condition: 25*20=500<=0<=40*20=800 -> no.
                   -> not blocked -> count +=1

                artillery3: (15,15)
                   wall0: L0 = 0*(15-5)+15*(5-(-5)) = 15*10 = 150
                         condition: 100<=150<=400 -> true -> blocked.
                   so skip artillery3.

                artillery4: (35,12)
                   wall0: 
                         base = 12 - (-5)=17
                         L0 = 0*(12-5)+35*(5-(-5)) = 35*10 = 350
                         condition: 5*17=85<=350<=20*17=340 -> 350>340 -> not blocked by wall0.
                   wall1: 
                         L1 = 0*(12-10)+35*(10-(-5)) = 35*15 = 525
                         condition: 25*17=425<=525<=40*17=680 -> yes, blocked by wall1.
                   so skip artillery4.

                count from group3: 1

           total count = 1 (group0) + 2 (group1) + 1 (group3) = 4  -> matches.

   Therefore, the code is correct.

   Now, we hope that the worst-case does not happen.

   If we meet the worst-case, we might need to optimize further by using faster input and PyPy, but in Python we try to optimize the inner loop by using local variables and precomputation.

   We can also not use groups_by_key as a dictionary, but since there are only 32 groups, we can have an array of groups indexed by bitmask from 0 to 31.

   Also, for each group, the list of walls in the group (by their index) is fixed, we can precompute for the group the list of walls (their (x1, x2, y0)).

   And for each artillery in a group, we store (x_a, y_a) and also precomputed values if needed.

   But the condition in the inner loop is:

        base = y_a - y_t
        L = x_t * (y_a - wall.y0) + x_a * (wall.y0 - y_t)

   and then compare to wall.x1 * base and wall.x2 * base.

   This is a few integer multiplications.

   Let's hope.

   Given the constraints, we write the code and hope that the judge's Python is fast enough or that the test data is not worst-case.

   Or perhaps the worst-case is not 40000 artilleries in a group with 5 walls and 40000 queries? If in the worst-case the artilleries are distributed evenly among groups, then the work per query is (N * M) / 32, so 40000 * 5 / 32 = 6250, then over 40000 queries: 6250 * 40000 = 250e6, which is acceptable.

   But the worst-case is when one group has all artilleries and that group has the maximum number of walls (5) and there are 40000 artilleries and 40000 queries: work = 40000 * 5 * 40000 = 8e9.

   So we must hope that the test data is not adversarial.

   We also note that if an artillery has no walls below it, then we only do the group of size 0, so it's fast.

   In the worst-case, it will be slow.

   Given the problem constraints and the fact that M is only 5, the worst-case might be acceptable in C++ but not in Python.

   But the problem says: time limit 1.0s.

   Therefore, we must try to optimize the inner loop in C++ if we were to write in C++, but in Python we have to hope for the best or use a compiled language.

 Since we must output Python code, we output the group method and hope that the groups with many walls and many artilleries are not the worst-case.

 We also use sys.stdin for faster input.

 Let's code accordingly.
