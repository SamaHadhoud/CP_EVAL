### Approach
The problem requires finding the highest integer \( k \) such that when we add all non-existing edges to the graph in some order, each edge \((a, b)\) is added only if the sum of the degrees of \( a \) and \( b \) at the time of addition is at least \( k \). The goal is to ensure the graph becomes complete (a clique) after adding all possible edges.

#### Key Insight
The solution leverages the concept of the **graph closure** from graph theory. The closure of a graph \( G \) with parameter \( k \) is obtained by repeatedly adding edges between non-adjacent vertices whose degree sum is at least \( k \) until no more edges can be added. The highest \( k \) for which the closure of \( G \) is a complete graph (clique) is the answer.

#### Binary Search
We perform a binary search on \( k \) over the range \([0, 2 \times (N-1)]\). For each candidate \( k \), we simulate the closure process:
1. **Initialization**: Start with the given graph and its vertex degrees.
2. **Heap Setup**: Use a max-heap (simulated with a min-heap by storing negative values) to prioritize non-edges by their current degree sum.
3. **Edge Addition**: Repeatedly extract the non-edge with the highest degree sum from the heap. If this sum is at least \( k \), add the edge to the graph, update the degrees of the involved vertices, and push updated degree sums for all non-edges incident to these vertices back into the heap.
4. **Termination**: The process stops when the heap is exhausted or the highest degree sum in the heap is below \( k \). The graph is complete if all possible edges are added.

#### Complexity Analysis
- **Binary Search**: The search runs in \( O(\log(2 \times (N-1))) \approx O(\log N) \) iterations.
- **Closure Simulation**: For each candidate \( k \), processing edges involves:
  - **Heap Operations**: Each non-edge is processed once, and updates due to degree changes push \( O(N) \) new entries per edge added. With \( O(N^2) \) non-edges initially and \( O(N) \) updates per edge, the total operations are \( O(N^3 \log N) \).
- **Overall Complexity**: With \( O(\log N) \) iterations and \( O(N^3 \log N) \) per iteration, the total complexity is \( O(N^3 \log^2 N) \). For \( N \leq 500 \), this is feasible given the constraints.

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of machines \( N \) and links \( M \), followed by the links themselves.
2. **Initial Setup**: The adjacency matrix `graph` and degree list `deg` are initialized based on the input links.
3. **Binary Search Setup**: The binary search is set up over the possible range of \( k \) values from 0 to \( 2 \times (N-1) \).
4. **Closure Simulation (check function)**: For each candidate \( k \):
   - **Initialization**: The current graph and degrees are copied to avoid modifying the original.
   - **Heap Initialization**: A max-heap (using negative values) is populated with all non-edges and their initial degree sums.
   - **Processing Non-Edges**: The heap is processed to add edges in order of the highest degree sum. When an edge is added, the degrees of its vertices are updated, and affected non-edges are pushed back into the heap with updated sums.
   - **Completion Check**: The process checks if all required edges were added.
5. **Binary Search Execution**: The binary search determines the highest \( k \) for which the closure simulation results in a complete graph.
6. **Output**: The highest valid \( k \) is printed.

This approach efficiently narrows down the possible \( k \) values using binary search and verifies each candidate by simulating the edge addition process with a priority on the highest degree sums, ensuring optimal performance within the problem constraints.
