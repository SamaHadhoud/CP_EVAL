To solve this problem, we need to find the highest integer \( k \) such that by adding all non-existing edges in some order, each edge \((a, b)\) is added only if the sum of the degrees of \( a \) and \( b \) at the time of addition is at least \( k \). The goal is to ensure the graph becomes complete (a clique) after adding all possible edges.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires transforming the given graph into a complete graph by adding all non-existing edges. The key challenge is determining the highest \( k \) such that there exists an order of adding edges where each edge is added only if the sum of the degrees of its endpoints at that moment is at least \( k \).

2. **Binary Search on \( k \)**: We perform a binary search over possible values of \( k \) (from 0 to \( 2 \times (N-1) \)). For each candidate \( k \), we simulate the process of adding edges:
   - **Initialization**: Start with the given graph and vertex degrees.
   - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Use a queue to process non-edges. For each non-edge \((i, j)\), if the sum of their current degrees is at least \( k \), add it to the queue.
   - **Edge Addition**: Process each non-edge in the queue. If the current degree sum is still at least \( k \), add the edge, update the degrees, and enqueue any new non-edges incident to the endpoints that now meet the \( k \) threshold.

3. **Check Completion**: After processing all possible non-edges, if all required edges are added, the candidate \( k \) is feasible. The highest feasible \( k \) is our answer.

```python

from collections import deque

def main():
    data = sys.stdin.read().split()
    if not data:
        return
    n = int(data[0])
    m = int(data[1])
    graph = [[False] * (n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]
    deg = [0] * (n+1)
    idx = 2
    for _ in range(m):
        u = int(data[idx])
        v = int(data[idx+1])
        idx += 2
        graph[u][v] = True
        graph[v][u] = True
        deg[u] += 1
        deg[v] += 1

    total_edges = n * (n - 1) // 2
    target_edges_to_add = total_edges - m

                continue
            if deg_copy[i] + deg_copy[j] < k:

            for node in (i, j):
                for neighbor in range(1, n+1):
                    if neighbor == node:

                        a, b = min(node, neighbor), max(node, neighbor)
                        if (a, b) not in in_queue:
                            s = deg_copy[node] + deg_copy[neighbor]
                            if s >= k:
                                in_queue.add((a, b))

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of machines \( N \) and links \( M \), followed by the links themselves. The adjacency matrix `graph` and degree list `deg` are initialized based on the input links.
2. **Binary Search Setup**: The binary search is set up over possible values of \( k \) from 0 to \( 2 \times (N-1) \).
3. **Feasibility Check (check function)**:
   - **Initialization**: For each candidate \( k \), the current graph and degrees are copied to avoid modifying the original.
   - **Queue Initialization**: A queue is initialized with all non-edges \((i, j)\) where the initial degree sum is at least \( k \).
   - **Processing Non-Edges**: The queue processes each non-edge. If the current degree sum is still at least \( k \), the edge is added, degrees are updated, and new non-edges incident to the endpoints (if they meet the \( k \) threshold) are enqueued.
4. **Binary Search Execution**: The binary search determines the highest \( k \) for which the feasibility check results in a complete graph.
5. **Output**: The highest valid \( k \) is printed.

This approach efficiently narrows down possible \( k \) values using binary search and verifies each candidate by simulating edge additions via BFS, ensuring optimal performance within the problem constraints.
