To solve this problem, we need to find the highest integer \( k \) such that when we add all non-existing edges to the graph in some order, each edge \((a, b)\) is added only if the sum of the degrees of \( a \) and \( b \) at the time of addition is at least \( k \). The goal is to ensure the graph becomes complete (a clique) after adding all possible edges.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires transforming the given graph into a complete graph by adding all missing edges. The key challenge is determining the maximum \( k \) such that there exists an order of adding edges where each edge \((a, b)\) is added only if the sum of the current degrees of \( a \) and \( b \) is at least \( k \).

2. **Binary Search on \( k \)**: We perform a binary search over possible values of \( k \) (from 0 to \( 2 \times (N-1) \)). For each candidate \( k \), we check if the graph can be completed by adding edges in an order that satisfies the degree sum condition.

3. **Closure Simulation**: For each candidate \( k \), we simulate the process of adding edges:
   - **Initialization**: Start with the given graph and vertex degrees.
   - **Queue Setup**: Use a queue to process edges. Initially, enqueue all non-edges \((u, v)\) where the sum of their degrees is at least \( k \).
   - **Edge Addition**: Process each edge from the queue. If the edge hasn't been added and the current degree sum still meets the condition, add the edge, update the degrees, and enqueue any new eligible edges incident to the vertices involved.

4. **Completion Check**: After processing all possible edges, check if the graph is complete (i.e., all possible edges have been added).

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of machines \( N \) and links \( M \), followed by \( M \) edges. The degrees of each node are computed based on these edges.
2. **Special Cases Handling**: If the graph is already complete, the answer is 0 since no edges need to be added.
3. **Binary Search Setup**: The binary search is performed over possible values of \( k \) from 0 to \( 2 \times (N-1) \).
4. **Closure Simulation for \( k \)**:
   - **Initialization**: The adjacency matrix `added` marks existing edges, and `deg_local` tracks current degrees.
   - **Queue Initialization**: Non-edges meeting the degree sum condition \( \geq k \) are enqueued.
   - **Processing Queue**: For each edge dequeued, if it hasn't been added and meets the condition, it is added. The degrees of its nodes are updated, and incident non-edges are checked for eligibility to be enqueued.
5. **Completion Check**: After processing, if all possible edges are added, the candidate \( k \) is feasible.
6. **Binary Search Execution**: The highest feasible \( k \) is found via binary search and printed.

This approach efficiently checks each candidate \( k \) by leveraging a queue to manage edge additions dynamically, ensuring optimal performance within the problem constraints.
