### Approach
The problem involves determining the number of Norland's artilleries visible from each proposed Sauville watchtower position. The key challenge is efficiently checking for each artillery and watchtower pair whether the line of sight is obstructed by any of Norland's defensive walls. Given the constraints (up to 40,000 artilleries, 5 walls, and 40,000 queries), a direct approach of checking each artillery-watchtower pair against all walls for every query would be computationally expensive (O(N*M*Q)), which is infeasible.

However, leveraging the small number of walls (M â‰¤ 5), we can optimize the solution by preprocessing the artilleries based on the walls below them. For each artillery, we precompute a list of walls that lie below it (i.e., walls with y-coordinate less than the artillery's y-coordinate). For each query, we then iterate over all artilleries and check only the walls in their precomputed lists to determine visibility. If any wall in the list blocks the line of sight (by the artillery being within the wall's shadow from the watchtower), the artillery is marked as not visible.

### Solution Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdint>
using namespace std;

struct Point {
    int x, y;
};

struct Wall {
    int x1, x2, y0;
};

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);

    int N, M, Q;
    cin >> N >> M >> Q;

    vector<Point> artilleries(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        cin >> artilleries[i].x >> artilleries[i].y;
    }

    vector<Wall> walls(M);
    for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
        cin >> walls[j].x1 >> walls[j].x2 >> walls[j].y0;
    }

    vector<vector<int>> groups(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
            if (artilleries[i].y > walls[j].y0) {
                groups[i].push_back(j);
            }
        }
    }

    vector<Point> queries(Q);
    for (int k = 0; k < Q; k++) {
        cin >> queries[k].x >> queries[k].y;
    }

    for (int q = 0; q < Q; q++) {
        int x_t = queries[q].x;
        int y_t = queries[q].y;
        int count_visible = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            int x_a = artilleries[i].x;
            int y_a = artilleries[i].y;
            bool is_blocked = false;

            for (int wall_index : groups[i]) {
                Wall w = walls[wall_index];
                int64_t base = (int64_t)y_a - y_t;
                int64_t num = (int64_t)x_t * (y_a - w.y0) + (int64_t)x_a * (w.y0 - y_t);
                int64_t lower_bound = (int64_t)w.x1 * base;
                int64_t upper_bound = (int64_t)w.x2 * base;

                if (num >= lower_bound && num <= upper_bound) {
                    is_blocked = true;
                    break;
                }
            }

            if (!is_blocked) {
                count_visible++;
            }
        }

        cout << count_visible << '\n';
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Input Reading**: The code reads the number of artilleries (N), walls (M), and queries (Q). It then reads the coordinates of the artilleries, walls, and proposed watchtower positions.
2. **Preprocessing**: For each artillery, it precomputes a list of walls that lie below it (i.e., walls with a y-coordinate less than the artillery's y-coordinate). This helps in reducing the number of checks per query.
3. **Query Processing**: For each query (watchtower position), the code checks each artillery. For each artillery, it checks only the walls in its precomputed list to determine if the line of sight is blocked. The blocking condition is verified using integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point inaccuracies. The condition involves checking if the intersection point of the line of sight with the wall's y-coordinate lies within the wall's x-bounds.
4. **Visibility Count**: If no wall blocks the line of sight for an artillery, it is counted as visible. The total count of visible artilleries is then output for each query.

This approach efficiently handles the constraints by leveraging preprocessing and careful integer arithmetic, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes. The complexity is O(N*M) for preprocessing and O(N*M*Q) for query processing, which is feasible given the problem constraints.
