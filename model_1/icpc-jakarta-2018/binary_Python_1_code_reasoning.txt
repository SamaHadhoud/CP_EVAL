 We are going to iterate over the possible lengths L (from the original length down to 1) to check if there exists a subsequence of S of length L that forms a binary number without leading zeros and <= K.

 However, note: the problem says the resulting string must not have leading zeros. So the first character must be '1'.

 Steps:
 1. We know that if we are to form a subsequence of length L, the first character must be '1'. Therefore, we can only start at indices where the bit is '1'.

 2. We can use dynamic programming for each fixed length. But note: the constraints |S| <= 60 and K up to 2^60 (so we cannot store numbers above K? we have to avoid big numbers).

 3. We'll iterate L from n down to 1:
    - For L=1: we just need to check if there is at least one bit that is either '0' or '1'. But note: the number must be <= K. Since K>=1, then both 0 and 1 are allowed? Actually, the problem says the calculator cannot work on integers larger than K. But note: the string must not have leading zeros. For a single bit, if it is '0', then it's 0 which is <=K (because K>=1) but the problem says the resulting string must not contain leading zeros. However, a single '0' is acceptable? Actually, the problem says "non-empty" and "no leading zeros" meaning that if we have a single zero then that is acceptable? But note: the sample input says S has no leading zeros, but the subsequence we form must not have leading zeros. However, a single zero is not considered to have a leading zero? Actually, the problem says "non-empty sequence" and "must not contain any leading zeroes". For a string of length 1: if it is '0', that is acceptable? But the problem states that Ayu's favorite string S has no leading zeros, but the subsequence might be different.

 However, the problem states: "The resulting binary string also must not contain any leading zeroes." This implies that if we have a subsequence that starts with a '0', then it must be of length 1? Actually, no: because if it starts with '0' and has more than one character, then it has a leading zero. But a single zero is acceptable? 

 But note: the problem says "non-empty sequence", and the example doesn't include zero. However, the problem does not explicitly forbid the entire subsequence being zero. But let's read: "must not contain any leading zeroes" meaning that if the string has more than one digit, the first digit must be 1. For a one-digit string, it can be zero.

 However, consider: if we have a subsequence "0", that is 0 in decimal. Since K>=1, 0<=K. So that is acceptable.

 Therefore, for L=1, we can use any single digit: either '0' or '1'. Since K>=1, both are <=K? (because 0<=1 and 1<=1). So for L=1, we can always form a valid number.

 Then the minimal removal would be n-1? But wait, we are iterating from the largest L downward. We want the largest L for which there exists a valid subsequence.

 However, note: we must consider that the subsequence of length L must not have leading zeros. That means:
   - If L>1, then the first character must be '1'. 
   - If L==1, then we can have '0' or '1'.

 So algorithm:
   Let n = len(S)
   We'll iterate L from n down to 1:
        We want to know: is there a subsequence of S of length L that forms a binary number <= K and without leading zeros?
        For L=1: we just check if there is any digit? Actually, since the string S is non-empty, we have at least one. But we must note: if we choose a single '0', that is valid. Also, a single '1' is valid. So L=1 is always valid.

        Therefore, we start from L=n and go down until we find the first L for which there exists a valid subsequence.

   How to check for a fixed L?
        We can use DP: 
          Let dp[j][i] = the minimal decimal value (or any value that we can compare with K) of a binary subsequence of length j ending at index i. But note: we want to avoid values above K and we want to avoid big numbers? However, L is at most 60, and K is up to 2^60, so we can store numbers as integers? Because the maximum length is 60, the maximum value is 2^60-1, which is within Python integers.

        But note: we cannot have an array of size 60*60=3600, which is acceptable.

        However, we want to avoid storing huge arrays? Actually, we can do:

        We'll do for a fixed L, but we iterate from length=1 to L. We can do:

          dp_prev[i] = value for subsequence of length (j-1) ending at i.

        Then for the current j (from 2 to L), we do:
          dp_curr[i] = for each k from 0 to i-1: 
              we can form a subsequence of length j ending at i by taking a subsequence of length j-1 ending at k (with k < i) and then append S[i]. 
          But note: we must avoid leading zeros. For j>=2, the first character must be '1'. How do we enforce that? 
          Actually, we start the subsequence at a '1'. So when j=1, we only consider starting at a '1'? But wait: for j=1, we can have a '0' as well? But then when we extend to j=2, if the first character is '0', then we get a two-digit number starting with 0 -> invalid. Therefore, we must ensure that the entire subsequence is built from an initial '1'. 

        However, note: we can also have a subsequence that starts at a '1' and then we extend arbitrarily? 

        How to do:

          Step 1: for j=1:
             for each i:
                 if S[i]=='1', then value = 1.
                 if S[i]=='0', then value = 0.

          But for j>=2, we require that the subsequence must start with a '1'. Therefore, when building a subsequence of length j, we require that the first character was a '1'. How do we know the first character? Actually, when we build the subsequence by extending, we started at a '1' for the first character. Then we extend arbitrarily. But note: we can extend with zeros? yes, as long as the entire string doesn't have leading zeros? Actually, we started with 1 so the rest can be arbitrary.

        Therefore, for j>=2, we can only extend a sequence that already started (so that we have at least one bit) and then we can add any bit.

        However, we must avoid building numbers that exceed K.

        We can do:

          Let dp_prev be an array of length n: for each index i, it stores the minimal value of a subsequence of length (j-1) ending at i? Actually, we don't need minimal value? We need to know the values? But note: when we extend, we want to form a new number: old_value * 2 + (0 or 1). 

          However, if we store the actual value, we can compute the next. But we have to avoid storing huge numbers? Actually, we are storing numbers up to 2^60, which is acceptable.

        But note: we want to know if there exists any subsequence of length L that is <=K. However, we also want to avoid unnecessary computations. But note: we are iterating L from n down to 1, so as soon as we find one we break.

        Algorithm for fixed L:

          dp_prev = [None] * n   # for j=1
          For i in range(n):
              if S[i]=='1':
                 dp_prev[i] = 1
              else:
                 dp_prev[i] = 0

          If L==1: then we break and return n-1? Actually, we are iterating from n down to 1, so we start with L=n. We break when we find a valid L.

          But note: we have to consider that for L=1, we have at least one valid subsequence? So if we don't find any for L>=2, then we use L=1.

          Actually, we can break the loop for the first L (starting from the largest) for which we have at least one subsequence that is <=K.

          For j from 2 to L:
              dp_curr = [None] * n   # we will fill for each index i
              We'll traverse i from 0 to n-1, and for each i, we look at all k in [0, i-1] such that we have a subsequence of length j-1 ending at k. But that would be O(n^2). Since n<=60, worst-case L=60, so total O(60^3) which is 216000, which is acceptable.

          However, we can optimize: we want to form the new number: value = dp_prev[k] * 2 + (1 if S[i]=='1' else 0). And we want to avoid values that exceed K. Also, we want to know if there is any that is <=K.

          But note: we don't care about the minimal value per se? We only care if there is one that is <=K. However, if we store the minimal value we have so far for the previous length, we can avoid storing the entire array? Actually, no: because we have to consider different starting points.

          Alternatively, we can do:

            Let dp_prev_min = an array that for each index k we have the value. Then for the current i, we can take the minimal value from all k < i? Actually, no: because the minimal value might not be the best to extend? For example, we have two sequences: one ending at k1 with value v1, and k2 with v2, and v1 < v2. Then when we extend to i, we get v1*2 + b and v2*2 + b. Which one is better? We want to minimize the resulting number? But we don't need the minimal, we just need to know if there's at least one that is <=K. However, if we use the minimal value from the previous step for k in [0, i-1] and then compute candidate = min_value * 2 + b, and if candidate <=K, then we set dp_curr[i] = candidate? But wait: that candidate might not be the value we get from the minimal sequence? Actually, we can use the minimal value from the previous step to form a candidate? However, if the minimal value is too big then we might not get a candidate? 

          Actually, we want the minimal value for the next state? But we are building from the left. We can do:

            We traverse i from 0 to n-1, and we maintain the minimal value from dp_prev for indices k from 0 to i-1. Then for each i, we consider:

                candidate = min_prev * 2 + (1 if S[i]=='1' else 0)

            But note: we must consider that the minimal_prev might be from a sequence that we can actually extend? However, if we maintain min_prev as the minimal value we have seen so far (from the previous length) for indices k from 0 to i-1, then we can compute candidate.

          However, caution: if we have two sequences with the same value? Then we don't need to store duplicates? But we only need to know if there is a candidate that is <=K.

          But note: we want to know if there exists a sequence of length j ending at i that is <=K. We can do:

            candidate = min_prev * 2 + (1 if S[i]=='1' else 0)

            Then if candidate <= K, then we set dp_curr[i] = candidate. Otherwise, we set it to a big number? Or we leave it as infinity meaning invalid.

          However, is that correct? Consider: 
            We have two sequences: 
               sequence A: value = x
               sequence B: value = y, where x < y.
            Then when we extend to i, the candidate from A is x*2+b, and from B is y*2+b. 
            Since x<y, then x*2+b <= y*2+b. So the minimal candidate we can get at i is from the minimal x? 

          Therefore, for each i, we only need to know the minimal value from the previous length for all k in [0, i-1]. 

          Steps for j (>=2):

            Let min_prev = a big number (like K+1) initially.
            Then traverse i from 0 to n-1:

                If we have a candidate from the previous length at i? Actually, we traverse i in increasing order, and for each i we consider the min_prev (which is the minimal value for the previous length for all indices < i). Then:

                    candidate = min_prev * 2 + (1 if S[i]=='1' else 0)   if min_prev is not the big number? But if min_prev is the big number, then there is no valid sequence to extend.

                Then if candidate <= K, then we set dp_curr[i] = candidate. Otherwise, we set it to a big number (or leave it as big meaning invalid).

                Then we update min_prev for the current i (for the previous length) for the next indices? Actually, we are at j-1: we want to update min_prev for the current i? But note: min_prev is the minimal value of the previous length for all indices from 0 to i-1. Then after processing i, we update min_prev with the value at i of the previous length? 

            Why update with the previous length? Because for the next index (i+1) we want to include the value at i? 

          Therefore, we do:

            min_prev = BIG   (a number > K, like K+1)
            dp_curr = [BIG] * n

            for i in range(n):
                if min_prev != BIG:   # meaning we have a valid sequence to extend
                    bit = 1 if S[i]=='1' else 0
                    candidate = min_prev * 2 + bit
                    if candidate <= K:
                        dp_curr[i] = candidate
                # Now update min_prev for the previous length at i: if dp_prev[i] is valid (i.e., not BIG) and it is the minimal?
                if dp_prev[i] < min_prev:
                    min_prev = dp_prev[i]

          But wait: the above update of min_prev is for the previous length state. However, we are processing the current length. And we want min_prev to be the minimal value of the previous length state for indices from 0 to i (so that for the next i, we have the minimal including the current i). 

          However, note: we have to consider that the minimal value we have seen so far (from the previous length) for indices [0, i] is updated by including i.

          But in the above, we update min_prev after we have processed i? Then when we process i, min_prev does not include the value at i? 

          That is correct: because we are building a sequence of length j by taking a subsequence that ends at k (with k < i) and then we append S[i]. So k must be strictly less than i. Therefore, the value at i (for the previous length) is not available for extending to the same i? 

          Therefore, we do not use the current i in min_prev when processing i.

          Then when do we update? We update min_prev with the current i after we have processed i? Then for the next i (i+1) we include the value at i? That is correct.

          However, what if the previous state at i is BIG? Then we skip.

          But note: we must consider that the previous state might be BIG meaning we don't have a valid sequence at i? Then we skip.

          So:

            min_prev = BIG
            for i in range(n):
                # If we have a valid min_prev (from indices < i) then we can form a candidate at i.
                if min_prev != BIG:
                    bit = 1 if S[i]=='1' else 0
                    candidate = min_prev * 2 + bit
                    if candidate <= K:
                        dp_curr[i] = candidate
                # Now, we want to update min_prev for the next i by including the previous state at i (if valid) for the next indices (i+1, ...)
                if dp_prev[i] != BIG and dp_prev[i] < min_prev:
                    min_prev = dp_prev[i]

          However, note: we are iterating i from 0 to n-1. At i=0, min_prev is BIG (so we skip) and then we update min_prev to dp_prev[0] if it is not BIG. Then for i=1, we use min_prev which is the minimal from indices 0 (only) and then update with i=1.

          This is correct.

        But note: we require that the subsequence of the previous length must be non-empty and we are building the next. Also, the subsequence must be increasing in indices? Yes, because we are taking in order.

        However, we must note: the subsequence must be contiguous in the original string? No, it's a subsequence (not contiguous) but the order is preserved.

        The above DP does not require contiguous? It only requires that the indices are increasing.

        Therefore, we are good.

   Then after building dp_curr for length j, we set dp_prev = dp_curr and move to j+1? Actually, j is from 2 to L.

   Then at the end of the inner loop (for j from 2 to L), we have an array dp_prev for length L. Then we check: if any value in dp_prev is <=K? Then we break the outer loop and output n-L.

   If we go through all L from n down to 1, and we don't find any for L>=1? Actually, for L=1 we know we have at least one. So we can break for L=1? 

   However, our outer loop is from n down to 1. We break as soon as we find one.

   But note: for L=1, we don't do the inner loop. We handle it separately.

   We can do:

        if L==1:
            # we know there's at least one valid subsequence? 
            # Actually, we can break and return n-1? But note: we are iterating from n down to 1, and we haven't found any for L>1. Then we use L=1.
            # But we want to check: is there a valid subsequence of length 1? 
            # Since S is non-empty, and we have at least one digit. And the value is 0 or 1, both <=K (because K>=1). So we break and output n-1.
            # So we break.

        However, in our code structure:

          for L in range(n, 0, -1):
            if L==1:
                # we can break and output n-1? But we are going to do the inner loop for j from 2 to 1? which does nothing. Then we check the dp_prev (which we built for L=1) and then we break? 

          Actually, for L=1 we don't enter the inner loop. Then we check the dp_prev (which we built for L=1) and we know that any value in dp_prev is <=1 (because the values are 0 or 1) and K>=1, so we break.

   Therefore, we can write:

        for L in range(n,0,-1):
            # Initialize for j=1: 
            dp_prev = [BIG] * n
            for i in range(n):
                if S[i]=='1':
                    dp_prev[i] = 1
                else:
                    dp_prev[i] = 0

            if L==1:
                # Check: any value in dp_prev is <=K? Since they are 0 or 1 and K>=1, we break.
                # So we break and output n-1? Actually, we break the outer loop and output n-L = n-1.
                # But note: we might have found a valid subsequence for L=1? Then we break.
                # But we can break here and output n-1? Actually, we are going to break the outer loop? But we are in the loop for L, and we found one for L=1? Then we break the outer loop.

            But wait: what if L>1? Then we do the inner loop for j from 2 to L.

            Then after the inner loop, we check: if any value in dp_prev (which now is for sequences of length L) is <=K? Then we break the outer loop and output n-L.

        But note: we must do the inner loop only for L>=2.

        Alternatively, we can do:

          if L==1: 
             # we know there's a valid subsequence? Then we break and output n-1.
             print(n-1)
             return

          else:
             # for j from 2 to L: ... 

        But we are iterating from L=n down to 1, so we want to break as soon as we find one. 

        Actually, we can do:

          We break the outer loop (by returning) as soon as we find a valid L.

        Therefore, we can write:

          for L in range(n,0,-1):
            # Build dp_prev for j=1
            dp_prev = [0] * n
            for i in range(n):
                if S[i]=='1':
                    dp_prev[i] = 1
                else:
                    dp_prev[i] = 0

            if L==1:
                # Since we are at L=1, we check: we know there is at least one? 
                # Actually, we don't need to check because 0 and 1 are <=K? But what if K=0? The problem says K>=1. So safe.
                print(n-1)
                return

            # For L>=2:
            found = False
            for j in range(2, L+1):
                dp_curr = [BIG] * n
                min_prev = BIG   # minimal value from the previous state (j-1) for indices we've seen so far (for k from 0 to i-1)
                for i in range(n):
                    # If we have a valid min_prev (meaning we have seen at least one sequence of length j-1 ending at an index < i) then we can extend
                    if min_prev != BIG:
                        bit_val = 1 if S[i]=='1' else 0
                        candidate = min_prev * 2 + bit_val
                        if candidate <= K:
                            dp_curr[i] = candidate
                    # Now update min_prev with dp_prev[i] (if it is valid and less than min_prev) for the next indices
                    if dp_prev[i] != BIG and dp_prev[i] < min_prev:
                        min_prev = dp_prev[i]

                # After building j, set dp_prev = dp_curr for the next j
                dp_prev = dp_curr

            # After building for j = L, check if there is any valid value in dp_prev?
            for value in dp_prev:
                if value <= K:
                    print(n - L)
                    return

          # If we get here, then we didn't find any for L in [n,1]? But we know L=1 must be valid. So we should not get here.

        However, we know that L=1 is always valid. Therefore, we will always break in the outer loop for L=1.

        But note: in the above, we break the inner loop for j from 2 to L, and then check at the end of the inner loop. Then we break the outer loop by returning.

        But what if we don't break in the outer loop for L? Then we go to the next L. 

        However, we start from L=n down to 1. So we will eventually hit L=1.

        But we can break early: as soon as we find a valid L.

        Therefore, we break the outer loop by returning as soon as we find one.

   However, we must note: for L>=2, we build the dp for all j from 2 to L. Then we check at the end. This might be expensive if we do for all L? But we break as soon as we find one.

   But worst-case we might do L= n, n-1, ... until L=1. And for each L, we do an inner loop for j from 2 to L (which is O(L)) and for each j we do O(n). So total operations: 
        Sum_{L=1}^{n} (if we don't break) ... but we break at the first valid L. 

   We are iterating from L=n down to 1, so the first valid L we find we break. Therefore, worst-case we do L from n down to 1? Actually, worst-case is that we don't break until L=1? Then we do:

        L = n: inner loop from j=2 to n: which is O(n) * O(n) = O(n^2) per L? Actually, the inner j loop runs from 2 to L (which is about L-1) and for each j we do O(n). So for a fixed L, we do O(L * n). And we do for L from n down to 1: so total operations = O(n^3). Since n<=60, 60^3=216000, which is acceptable.

   But note: we break as soon as we find one. So worst-case we do the entire loop until L=1? Then we do:

        For L=n: O(n * n) = 60*60=3600? Then L=n-1: O((n-1)*n) = 59*60, ... until L=2: O(2*60) and L=1: O(1). Total: about O(n^3) which is 60^3/3? Actually, the total is about O(n^3). 

        The total number of operations is: 
            T = n^2 + (n-1)^2 + ... + 1^2? Actually, no: for each L, we do j from 2 to L (so L-1 iterations) and each j does O(n). So for fixed L, we do O(n*(L-1)). Then total T = n * (n-1) + n*(n-2) + ... + n*(1) for L from n down to 2? Actually, no: we do for each L separately.

        Specifically:

            L = n: inner loop j from 2 to n: n-1 steps, each step O(n) -> O(n*(n-1))
            L = n-1: inner loop j from 2 to n-1: n-2 steps, each O(n) -> O(n*(n-2))
            ...
            L = 2: inner loop j from 2 to 2: 1 step, O(n) -> O(n)

            Then total = n * ( (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1 ) = n * (n-1)*n/2? Actually, the inner sum is the sum of integers from 1 to n-1: (n-1)*n/2. Then total = n * (n*(n-1)/2) = O(n^3). 

        Since n<=60, n^3=216000, which is acceptable in Python? In worst-case, 216000 iterations, which is acceptable.

   But note: we also have the outer L loop from n down to 1: which is about n (60) iterations. So the total number of iterations in the inner loops is about 60 * (60*60) = 216000? Actually, no: the inner j loop for a fixed L does (L-1) iterations, and each iteration we do a loop of n. So for fixed L, it's n*(L-1). Then total = n * ( (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1 ) = n * (n*(n-1)/2) = n^3/2 - n^2/2, which for n=60: 60^3/2 = 108000.

   This is acceptable.

   However, we can optimize by breaking early in the inner j loop? Actually, if at some j we have no valid state at all (i.e., min_prev remains BIG and we don't set any dp_curr[i] to a non-BIG value), then we can break the inner j loop and skip to the next L? Because if we have no sequences of length j, then we cannot form sequences of length j+1.

        So we can add:

            if min_prev is BIG at the end of the j loop (but actually we update min_prev during the i loop) and we also set dp_curr? We can check after the inner i loop for j: if we have at least one valid in dp_curr? 

            Actually, we can check after the j loop: if for all i, dp_curr[i] is BIG, then we break the inner j loop and skip to the next L? Because we cannot build sequences of length j+1.

        But note: we are building for j, then we set dp_prev = dp_curr and then j increases. But if we break the inner j loop, we skip the rest of j and then we check the current state? Then we break the inner j loop and then we go to check the current L? Actually, we don't have a complete dp_prev for the entire L? Then we skip this L.

        Therefore, we can break the inner j loop as soon as we cannot form any sequence of length j? Then we break and skip to the next L.

        How: after we build j, we check: is there any valid in dp_curr? If not, then we break the j loop and move to the next L.

        We can do:

            for j in range(2, L+1):
                dp_curr = [BIG] * n
                min_prev = BIG
                for i in range(n):
                    ... as above ...

                # After processing j, check if there is any valid in dp_curr?
                found_j = False
                for x in dp_curr:
                    if x != BIG:
                        found_j = True
                        break
                if not found_j:
                    break   # break the inner j loop: we cannot form sequences of length j? Then we skip the rest of j and then we break to the next L.

                # else, set dp_prev = dp_curr and continue to j+1.

            Then after the j loop (either by breaking or by finishing), we check the last state: 
                if we broke the inner j loop, then we don't check for L? 
                But we break the inner j loop because we cannot form a sequence of length j? Then we cannot form a sequence of length L (which is >= j). So we skip to the next L.

            Therefore, we only check at the end of the inner j loop (without breaking) if we built up to j=L? Then we check if there's any valid.

            Alternatively, we can break the inner j loop and then skip the rest. Then we don't check for L? 

            But note: we break the inner j loop at j0 (which is < L). Then we skip the rest of the j loop and then we don't have a state for j=L? So we skip to the next L.

            That is acceptable.

        But we can also note: if we break at j0, then we skip to the next L. Then we don't need to check for L at the end? 

        So we can do:

            for j in range(2, L+1):
                ... build dp_curr ...
                # Check if we have at least one valid in dp_curr?
                if all(x == BIG for x in dp_curr):
                    break   # break the inner j loop: and we then skip to next L.

                else:
                    dp_prev = dp_curr   # for the next j

            else:   # note: we only enter this if we did not break the inner j loop (i.e., we built up to j=L)
                # Then check if there's any valid in dp_prev (which is now for j=L)
                for value in dp_prev:
                    if value <= K:
                        print(n-L)
                        return

        This avoids building for j from j0+1 to L if we already broke at j0.

        This is an optimization.

   However, worst-case we still do O(n^3) and n=60 is acceptable. But it might help in practice.

   But note: if we break early in the inner j loop, we avoid unnecessary computation.

   Therefore, we implement:

        for L in range(n,0,-1):
            # Build initial state for j=1
            dp_prev = [BIG] * n
            for i in range(n):
                if S[i]=='1':
                    dp_prev[i] = 1
                else:
                    dp_prev[i] = 0

            if L == 1:
                # We know there is at least one valid? (since K>=1, and 0 and 1 are <=K) -> but what if K=0? The problem says K>=1. So safe.
                # Actually, we can break and output n-1.
                print(n-1)
                return

            # For L>=2:
            # We will iterate j from 2 to L
            for j in range(2, L+1):
                dp_curr = [BIG] * n
                min_prev = BIG   # minimal value from dp_prev for indices < i
                for i in range(n):
                    if min_prev != BIG:
                        bit_val = 1 if S[i]=='1' else 0
                        candidate = min_prev * 2 + bit_val
                        if candidate <= K:
                            dp_curr[i] = candidate
                    # Update min_prev with dp_prev[i] (if valid) for the next indices
                    if dp_prev[i] < min_prev:
                        min_prev = dp_prev[i]

                # Check if we have any valid state in dp_curr?
                has_valid = False
                for x in dp_curr:
                    if x != BIG:
                        has_valid = True
                        break
                if not has_valid:
                    break   # break the inner j loop: cannot build sequences of length j, so skip to next L.

                dp_prev = dp_curr   # update for the next j

                # If we are at the last j (j==L), then we check after the inner j loop?
            else:
                # We only enter here if we did not break the inner j loop (so we built up to j=L)
                for value in dp_prev:
                    if value <= K:
                        print(n-L)
                        return

        # Then we continue to next L? 

   But note: we break the outer loop by returning when we find a valid L. If we don't break, we go to the next L.

   And we know L=1 will break.

   However, we must handle the case when we break the inner j loop? Then we go to the next L.

   This is acceptable.

   But note: the update for min_prev: we do "if dp_prev[i] < min_prev" without checking if dp_prev[i] is BIG? 

        Actually, we set min_prev = BIG initially. Then if we have a dp_prev[i] that is BIG, then we skip? But we can avoid updating with BIG? 

        We can change:

            if dp_prev[i] != BIG and dp_prev[i] < min_prev:
                min_prev = dp_prev[i]

   This is safer.

   Let's test on a small example: 
        S = "10", K=1, n=2.

        We iterate L from 2 down to 1.

        L=2:
            j=1: dp_prev = [1,0]   (for indices0 and 1)
            then j=2:
                min_prev = BIG
                i=0: 
                    min_prev is BIG -> skip.
                    update: dp_prev[0]=1 -> min_prev = min(BIG,1) -> min_prev=1
                i=1:
                    min_prev=1 -> candidate = 1*2 + 0 = 2 -> but 2>K (K=1)? so we set dp_curr[1]=BIG? 
                    then update min_prev: at i=1, dp_prev[1]=0 -> now min_prev = min(1,0)=0? 
                Then after j=2, dp_curr = [BIG, BIG]? Actually, at i=1 we computed candidate=2 which is >K -> so set to BIG. Then we check: no valid? so we break the inner j loop and skip to next L.

        Then L=1: we output n-1=1.

        But the expected answer: we can remove one bit to get "1" (which is 1) or "0" (which is 0). So removals=1 -> output=1.

        So the above is correct.

   Another example: S="10", K=2, then:
        L=2:
            j=1: [1,0]
            j=2:
                i=0: skip (min_prev=BIG initially), then update min_prev=1.
                i=1: candidate = 1*2+0=2 -> <=K? yes -> set dp_curr[1]=2.
                Then we set dp_prev = dp_curr = [BIG,2] for the next j? But j=2 is the last (L=2). Then we check: dp_prev has 2 which is <=2 -> valid. Then we output n-L=0? But wait: we don't need to remove any bit? because the entire string "10" is 2, which is <=2. So removals=0.

        So output=0.

   Therefore, the code:

        We set BIG = K+1.

        Steps:

          for L in range(n,0,-1):
            dp_prev = [BIG]*n
            for i in range(n):
                if S[i]=='1':
                    dp_prev[i] = 1
                else:
                    dp_prev[i] = 0

            if L==1:
                # We know it's valid? Then output n-1 and return.
                print(n-1)
                return

            # For L>=2, we iterate j from 2 to L
            for j in range(2, L+1):
                dp_curr = [BIG]*n
                min_prev = BIG
                for i in range(n):
                    if min_prev != BIG:
                        bit_val = 1 if S[i]=='1' else 0
                        candidate = min_prev * 2 + bit_val
                        if candidate <= K:
                            dp_curr[i] = candidate
                    # Update min_prev: we only consider non-BIG values
                    if dp_prev[i] != BIG and dp_prev[i] < min_prev:
                        min_prev = dp_prev[i]

                # Check if we have any valid in dp_curr?
                if all(x == BIG for x in dp_curr):
                    break   # break inner j loop: no valid sequence of length j, so we skip to next L.

                dp_prev = dp_curr   # update for next j

            else:
                # We did not break the inner j loop -> we built up to j=L and we have dp_prev for sequences of length L.
                for value in dp_prev:
                    if value <= K:
                        print(n-L)
                        return

          # Since we know L=1 must be valid, we should have returned by now.

   However, we have a return in L=1. So we are safe.

   Let's test with sample input 1: K=13, S="1100101"

        We expect output=3.

        How? We remove 3 bits -> the result has length 4? So L=4.

        We start L from 7 (n=7) and go down to 1. We will check L=7,6,5,4 -> and at L=4 we should find a valid subsequence? 

        For L=4: 
            j=1: dp_prev = [1,1,0,0,1,0,1]   (all valid: 1,1,0,0,1,0,1)
            j=2: 
                min_prev = BIG
                i=0: min_prev=BIG -> skip. Then update min_prev = min(BIG,1)=1.
                i=1: candidate = 1*2+1 = 3 -> set dp_curr[1]=3; update min_prev = min(1, dp_prev[1]=1) -> min_prev=1.
                i=2: candidate = 1*2+0=2 -> set dp_curr[2]=2; update min_prev = min(1, dp_prev[2]=0)=0.
                i=3: candidate = 0*2+0=0 -> set dp_curr[3]=0; update min_prev = min(0,0)=0.
                i=4: candidate = 0*2+1=1 -> set dp_curr[4]=1; update min_prev = min(0,1)=0.
                i=5: candidate = 0*2+0=0 -> set dp_curr[5]=0; update min_prev=0.
                i=6: candidate = 0*2+1=1 -> set dp_curr[6]=1; update min_prev=0.
                Then we have dp_curr = [BIG,3,2,0,1,0,1] -> valid? then we set dp_prev=dp_curr and j=3.

            j=3:
                min_prev = BIG
                i=0: skip -> then update min_prev = min(BIG, dp_prev[0]=BIG) -> remains BIG.
                i=1: min_prev is now updated to min_prev = min(BIG, dp_prev[1]=3) -> min_prev=3? 
                    But wait, we update min_prev after processing i? Actually, we update at the end of the i step? 
                    So for i=1: we look at min_prev (which is BIG) -> skip. Then update min_prev = min(BIG,3)=3.
                i=2: min_prev=3 -> candidate=3*2+0=6 -> set dp_curr[2]=6; then update min_prev=min(3, dp_prev[2]=2)=2.
                i=3: candidate=2*2+0=4 -> set dp_curr[3]=4; update min_prev=min(2, dp_prev[3]=0)=0.
                i=4: candidate=0*2+1=1 -> set dp_curr[4]=1; update min_prev=0.
                i=5: candidate=0*2+0=0 -> set dp_curr[5]=0; update min_prev=0.
                i=6: candidate=0*2+1=1 -> set dp_curr[6]=1; update min_prev=0.
                Then dp_curr = [BIG, BIG,6,4,1,0,1] -> valid? then set dp_prev=dp_curr and j=4.

            j=4:
                min_prev = BIG
                i=0: skip -> update min_prev = min(BIG, BIG)=BIG.
                i=1: skip (min_prev=BIG) -> then update min_prev=min(BIG,3)=3 -> but wait: we don't update until after processing i? 
                    So for i=1: min_prev is BIG -> skip. Then update min_prev = min(BIG,3)=3.
                i=2: min_prev=3 -> candidate=3*2+0=6 -> set dp_curr[2]=6; update min_prev=min(3,6)=3? 
                    Actually, we update min_prev with the previous state at i=2? which is 6? and 3<6 -> so min_prev remains 3.
                i=3: candidate=3*2+0=6 -> set dp_curr[3]=6; update min_prev=min(3,4)=3? 
                i=4: candidate=3*2+1=7 -> set dp_curr[4]=7; update min_prev=min(3,1)=1? 
                i=5: candidate=1*2+0=2 -> set dp_curr[5]=2; update min_prev=min(1,0)=0? 
                i=6: candidate=0*2+1=1 -> set dp_curr[6]=1; update min_prev=0.

                Then dp_curr = [BIG, BIG,6,6,7,2,1] -> and we check: 6,6,7,2,1 are all <=13? Then we have valid ones.

                Then we break and output n-L = 7-4 = 3.

        So it matches.

   Another sample: K=13, S="1111111" -> expected output=4.

        We remove 4 bits to get "111" -> 7, which is <=13. So the subsequence has length 3.

        We start from L=7 down to 1. We will break at L=3.

        For L=3:
            j=1: dp_prev = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1] (all 1)
            j=2: 
                min_prev = BIG
                i=0: skip -> min_prev=min(BIG,1)=1.
                i=1: candidate=1*2+1=3 -> set dp_curr[1]=3 -> min_prev=min(1,1)=1.
                i=2: candidate=1*2+1=3 -> set dp_curr[2]=3 -> min_prev=min(1,1)=1.
                ... all positions: dp_curr = [BIG,3,3,3,3,3,3]
            j=3:
                min_prev = BIG
                i=0: skip -> min_prev=min(BIG, BIG)=BIG? Actually, dp_prev[0]=BIG? 
                    But wait: for j=2 we built dp_prev = [BIG,3,3,3,3,3,3] (so the first element is BIG) -> 
                i=0: skip -> then update min_prev: min(BIG, BIG)=BIG -> remains BIG.
                i=1: skip (min_prev=BIG) -> then update min_prev=min(BIG,3)=3.
                i=2: min_prev=3 -> candidate=3*2+1=7 -> set dp_curr[2]=7 -> update min_prev=min(3,3)=3.
                i=3: min_prev=3 -> candidate=3*2+1=7 -> set dp_curr[3]=7 -> min_prev=min(3,3)=3.
                ... all positions from i=2 to 6: set to 7.

                Then at the end, we have a valid state? 7<=13 -> yes. Then we break and output n-L=7-3=4.

        Therefore, output=4.

   But note: the problem says we remove 4 bits to get 111 -> which is 3 bits. So we output 7-3=4. Correct.

   However, note: we also have the possibility of a subsequence of length 4? But we break at the first L (largest L) that is valid. We start from L=7 and go down to L=3. So we break at L=3.

   Therefore, we output 4.

   But what if there is a subsequence of length 4 that is valid? Then we would break at L=4? 

        For example: if we have a string that we can form a subsequence of length 4 that is <=13? Then we would break at L=4 and output n-4. But in the sample "1111111", what are the possible subsequences of length 4? 

        The smallest value we can form with 4 ones is 15 (1111 in binary) which is 15>13. So no valid subsequence of length 4? 

        Therefore, we skip L=4, then L=3 is the next.

   So the code is correct.

   Let's write the code accordingly.

   However, note: we set BIG = K+1. But what if K is 0? The problem states K>=1, so we are safe.

   Also, note: for L=1, we output n-1. But what if the entire string is already valid? Then we break at L=n and output 0. 

   Example: K=5, S="101" -> 5 in decimal. Then we can break at L=3? 
        We need to check if the entire string is <=5? 101 is 5, which is <=5 -> valid.

        Then we output n-3 = 0.

   Therefore, we have the solution.

   We'll code accordingly.

   One more note: the problem says the resulting string must not have leading zeros. Our DP for j>=2 uses the fact that the first character must be '1'? Actually, we start the subsequence only at a '1' for the first character? 

        In the base case j=1, we include both 0 and 1. Then for j>=2, we extend only sequences that started with a '1'? Because we update min_prev from the base case: if the base case has a 0, then we include it? But then when we extend, we form a two-digit number that starts with 0? which is invalid? 

        How do we avoid that? 

        Actually, in the base case we set for a '0' to 0. Then when we build j=2:

            For i, if we have min_prev that is 0 (from a previous 0), then we form 0*2 + bit = bit. But that would be a two-digit number starting with 0? which is invalid? 

        The problem requires: the resulting string must not contain any leading zeros. This means that the entire string must not have a '0' as the first character. But if we form a two-digit number that starts with 0? that is invalid.

        Therefore, we must not extend a sequence that starts with 0 for j>=2? 

        How to enforce? 

        We should only consider sequences that start with a '1'. Therefore, for j=1 we only consider the ones that are 1? But wait: for j=1 we can have a 0? Then we cannot extend it? 

        Actually, we can have a subsequence of length 1 that is 0? Then for j=2, we cannot extend it? So we can leave it as is? 

        But the problem: the subsequence we form for j>=2 must start with 1. Therefore, the first character must be 1. 

        Therefore, for j=1: we can have 0 and 1? Then for j>=2: we only extend sequences that are not the single 0? Actually, we can extend the 0? but then we form a two-digit number that starts with 0? which is invalid? 

        So we must not extend sequences that start with 0? 

        How to do? 

        We can in the base case for j=1: we set the state for a '0' to 0, but then when we build j>=2, we do not use the 0? 

        How? 

            We update min_prev only from states that are from a starting '1'? 

        Actually, no: we want to build a sequence that starts with a '1'. But the entire sequence of length j>=2 must start with a '1'. So the first character must be a '1'. Therefore, the state for the previous length (j-1) must represent a sequence that starts with a '1'. 

        But in our base case j=1, we have both 0 and 1. Then for j=2, we are building sequences of length 2: the first character must be a '1'. So we should only extend sequences that are 1? 

        Therefore, for j=2: we should only consider the state from j=1 that are 1? 

        How to enforce? 

            In the j=2 loop, when we update min_prev, we only update from the states that are 1? 

        But wait: what if we have a sequence of length 1 that is 0? Then we skip it? 

        Actually, we can set for j=1: we set 0 to 0, but then when building j=2, we do not use the 0? 

        How? 

            We can modify the base state for j=1: 
                for j=1: 
                    if S[i]=='1': state[i]=1
                    else: state[i]=BIG   # because we cannot use a 0 as the start of a sequence of length>=2? But wait: we are building for j=1, which can be a single 0. But when extending to j=2, we must not use the 0? 

        But note: we are building for j=1 and then j=2 separately. 

        Actually, we have two possibilities:
          - The subsequence of length 1: we can have 0 and 1.
          - For subsequences of length>=2: we require the first character to be 1.

        Therefore, for j=1 we leave 0 as 0. But when building j>=2, we should only use the states from j-1 that are from a sequence that starts with a 1? 

        How do we know? 

        Actually, we don't store the entire sequence. We only store the value. How do we know the first character? 

        We can note: if the state for j-1 is 0, then the sequence is "0", which we cannot extend? 

        But if the state for j-1 is 1, then the sequence is "1", which we can extend.

        However, what about a sequence of length 2 that is "10"? That is valid? But the value is 2. How do we know the first character? 

        Actually, we don't need to know the first character. The problem condition is satisfied if the entire string has no leading zeros. This requires that the first character must be 1. 

        But note: we are building by extending a sequence that might be any valid sequence? 

        Actually, the condition is automatically satisfied if we started with a 1 and then we add any bits? 

        However, if we extend a sequence that started with a 0? then the entire sequence would have a leading 0? 

        But we don't have such sequences of length>=2? because we never use a sequence that started with 0 to extend? 

        How? 

            We only extend sequences that are non-zero? Actually, no: if we have a sequence of length 1 that is 0, we set it to 0. Then when we extend, we form a number that starts with 0? which is invalid. Therefore, we should avoid using 0 as a starting point for sequences of length>=2.

        Therefore, we can do: for j>=2, when updating min_prev, we skip the states that are 0? 

        But note: the state for j-1 might be a sequence of length j-1 that is non-zero? For example, "10" is 2. Then we can extend? 

        Actually, we don't have to worry: the state for j-1 is the entire value. We don't care about the string. But if the state is non-zero, then the first character must be 1? 

        Actually, no: consider a sequence of length 2: "01" -> that is 1? But wait, we cannot form "01" because that would be a leading zero? 

        How do we form sequences? We take the bits in order. But we require no leading zeros. So the first bit must be 1. Then the entire sequence is a valid binary number without leading zeros. 

        Therefore, we must only use states from j-1 that are not the single 0? 

        Actually, for j-1>=2, the state must be at least 1? 

        But wait: we can have a sequence of length 2 that is "10" -> value=2, which is non-zero. But also "00" is invalid? 

        How did we form the sequence? We only form sequences that start with 1? 

        Actually, we built the state for j-1 by starting with j=1 (which we allowed 0 and 1) and then for j=2 we built by extending? But we extended the 0? 

        We must not extend the 0? 

        Therefore, we can change: for j>=2, when updating min_prev, we skip states that are 0? 

        But note: if we have a sequence of length j-1 that is 0, then it is represented as 0. Then we don't want to use it? 

        How? 

            In the j>=2 loop, when updating min_prev, we do:

                if dp_prev[i] != BIG and dp_prev[i] != 0 and dp_prev[i] < min_prev:   # ?

            But wait: what if we have a sequence of length 1 that is 1? Then we use it? 

            Actually, we want to skip any state that is 0? 

            Why? Because 0 in the state for j-1 might be a sequence of one zero? Then if we extend, we get a two-digit number that starts with 0? 

            But what if the state for j-1 is 0 but the sequence is actually of length 1? Then we cannot extend? 

            However, we can also have a sequence of length j-1 that has value 0? Actually, that is impossible for j-1>=2? Because a sequence of length>=2 that starts with 1 must be at least 2? 

            But wait: we can have a sequence of length 2: "00" -> invalid? So we never built it? 

            Actually, we built the state for j=1: we have 0 for a zero. Then for j=2: we extend? Then we form 0*2+bit? which is 0 or 1? Then we set the state to 0 or 1? 

            But that sequence "00" or "01" is invalid? 

            Therefore, we must not build sequences that start with 0? 

            How to enforce? 

            We can change the base case: for j=1, we set a state to 0 only if we are building L=1? But for building L>=2, we require the first character to be 1? 

            Actually, we can do:

                For j=1, we set:
                    if S[i]=='1': state=1
                    else: state=0   # for L=1 we need it? but for L>=2, we only use states that are 1? 

            Then for j>=2, when we update min_prev, we skip the states that are 0? 

            But note: we are building for a fixed L. We do:

                for L in ...:
                    if L==1: ... (and we allow 0 and 1)
                    else: 
                         for j=1: we set state for each i: if S[i]=='1' then 1, else BIG? (because we cannot use a 0 as the start for a sequence of length L>=2? and if we are building L>=2, then we require the entire sequence to be without leading zeros, so the first character must be 1) 

            Therefore, for L>=2, the base state j=1: we only consider the ones that are 1? 

            Why? Because the entire sequence must start with 1. Therefore, the first character must be 1. So we only start with a 1.

            Then for j>=2, we extend arbitrarily? 

            This is correct.

        So we modify:

            for L in range(n,0,-1):
                if L==1:
                    # Then we build dp_prev for j=1: include both 0 and 1.
                    dp_prev = [0] * n
                    for i in range(n):
                        if S[i]=='1':
                            dp_prev[i] = 1
                        else:
                            dp_prev[i] = 0
                else:
                    # L>=2: then for j=1, we only consider the '1's? because the sequence must start with 1.
                    dp_prev = [BIG] * n
                    for i in range(n):
                        if S[i]=='1':
                            dp_prev[i] = 1

            Then the rest remains.

        Then for L>=2, we never use a 0 as the start? 

        Let's test with S="0", but the problem states S has no leading zeros? So S cannot be "0" by itself? Actually, the problem says "non-empty" and "no leading zeros", so the only possibility for S="0" is that the string is "0". But the problem says "contains no leading zeroes", so "0" is acceptable? 

        Actually, the problem says: "Ayu has a favorite binary string S which contains no leading zeroes." -> meaning that if the string is "0", that is acceptable? 

        But the input: |S|>=1. So S could be "0". 

        Then for S="0", K=1:
            n=1
            Then we iterate L from 1 down to 1: 
                L=1: 
                    we set dp_prev[0]=0 (because S[0]=='0'? and L==1) 
                    then we output n-1=0.

            But we are allowed to remove 0 bits? then we have "0", which is 0<=1 -> valid.

        For S="0", K=1, we output 0.

        For S="0", L>=2? n=1, so we skip L>=2.

        But what if S="01", K=1? 
            n=2
            We start with L=2: 
                j=1: for L>=2, we set:
                    i=0: S[0]=='0' -> set to BIG
                    i=1: S[1]=='1' -> set to 1.
                Then j=2: 
                    min_prev = BIG
                    i=0: skip -> then update min_prev = min(BIG, BIG)=BIG.
                    i=1: min_prev=BIG -> skip. Then update min_prev = min(BIG,1)=1.
                Then we check: no valid state in j=2? -> break inner j loop -> skip to next L.
            Then L=1: 
                we set: 
                    i=0:0, i=1:1 -> both valid? Then we output n-1=1.

            But expected: we can remove one bit to get "0" or "1", both are <=1. So removals=1? 

            Alternatively, we can remove the first bit to get "1", which is 1<=1 -> valid, and removal=1.

            So output=1.

        But what if we want to form the entire string? The entire string "01" has a leading zero? So it is invalid? 

        Therefore, we cannot form a subsequence of the entire string? 

        But we can form a subsequence of length 1: either the first or the last.

        So the above is correct.

        However, note: we are allowed to remove bits arbitrarily? So we can form "1" by removing the first bit? 

        Therefore, the answer is 1 removal.

        The above code for S="01", K=1: 
            For L=2: we skip because we cannot form a valid sequence of length 2? 
            Then we do L=1: output 2-1=1.

        So it matches.

   Therefore, we update the base state for L>=2 to only include the '1's for j=1.

   This is the final code.

   We'll write accordingly.

   Note: we must be careful: for L>=2, the base state j=1: we set only the '1's to 1, and the '0's to BIG.

   Then the rest of the DP for j>=2 remains.

   We'll code accordingly.

   Let's test the sample: S="10", K=2 -> entire string is valid? 
        L=2: 
            j=1: 
                i0: '1' -> 1
                i1: '0' -> BIG
            Then j=2: 
                min_prev = BIG
                i0: skip -> then update min_prev = min(BIG,1)=1.
                i1: min_prev=1 -> candidate=1*2+0=2 -> set dp_curr[1]=2 -> then update min_prev=min(1, BIG)=1? (because at i1, dp_prev[1]=BIG) -> so min_prev remains 1? 
            Then we have dp_curr = [BIG,2] -> valid? Then we break and output 0.

        Correct.

   But what about the sequence "10" is the entire string? That is 2, which is <=2. So we output 0.

   Therefore, the code is:

        BIG = K+1
        n = len(S)

        for L in range(n,0,-1):
            if L==1:
                dp_prev = [0] * n
                for i in range(n):
                    if S[i]=='1':
                        dp_prev[i] = 1
                    else:
                        dp_prev[i] = 0
                # Since we know any value in dp_prev is <=K (because K>=1, and 0 and 1 are <=K), we can break and output n-1.
                print(n-1)
                return
            else:
                # L>=2: base state j=1: only set '1's to 1, others to BIG.
                dp_prev = [BIG] * n
                for i in range(n):
                    if S[i]=='1':
                        dp_prev[i] = 1

                # Now we iterate j from 2 to L
                for j in range(2, L+1):
                    dp_curr = [BIG] * n
                    min_prev = BIG
                    for i in range(n):
                        if min_prev != BIG:
                            bit_val = 1 if S[i]=='1' else 0
                            candidate = min_prev * 2 + bit_val
                            if candidate <= K:
                                dp_curr[i] = candidate
                        # Update min_prev: we only consider non-BIG and we want the minimal value from the previous state for indices from 0 to i (for the same j-1) 
                        if dp_prev[i] != BIG and dp_prev[i] < min_prev:
                            min_prev = dp_prev[i]

                    # Check if we have any valid state in dp_curr?
                    if all(x == BIG for x in dp_curr):
                        break   # break inner j loop: skip to next L.

                    dp_prev = dp_curr

                else:
                    # We built up to j=L: check if we have at least one valid?
                    for value in dp_prev:
                        if value <= K:
                            print(n - L)
                            return

        # Since we know L=1 is always valid, we should not get here.

   We'll run the sample inputs.

   But note: the problem constraints: n<=60, and K up to 2^60. We are using integers: 2^60 is about 1e18, which is within Python integers.

   We'll code accordingly.

   However, note: we might compute candidate = min_prev * 2 + bit_val. But min_prev might be as large as K? Then candidate might be 2*K+1? Then we compare candidate<=K? 

        But if min_prev > (K-1)//2, then candidate will be >K? 

        We set candidate only if candidate<=K? 

        But what if min_prev is large? Then we skip setting. 

        Also, we update min_prev only with the minimal value? 

        But if we have a min_prev that is already > K, then we skip? 

        Actually, we set min_prev only from dp_prev[i] that are <=K? But we have set all states that exceed K to BIG? And we skip BIG in the update. 

        So min_prev is always <=K? 

        Then candidate = min_prev*2 + bit_val <= 2*K+1? But we check candidate<=K? 

        Actually, if min_prev > (K-1)//2, then min_prev*2 might be >K? Then candidate>K? so we skip.

        Therefore, we don't set dp_curr[i] in that case.

   So we are safe.

   We'll write the code accordingly.

   Let's run the provided examples.

   Example 1: K=13, S="1100101" -> expected 3.
        We break at L=4: output 3.

   Example 2: K=13, S="1111111" -> expected 4.
        We break at L=3: output 4.

   We'll write the code accordingly.

   Note: we must be cautious about the update of min_prev: we update at each i after processing i? 

   We'll run the sample S="10", K=2 to see if it returns 0.

   We'll code accordingly.

   Let's write the code.
