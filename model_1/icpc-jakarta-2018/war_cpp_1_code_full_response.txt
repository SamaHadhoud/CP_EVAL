To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of Norland's artilleries visible from each proposed Sauville watchtower position. The visibility of an artillery from a watchtower is determined by whether the line connecting them does not intersect any of Norland's defensive walls. Given the constraints (up to 40,000 artilleries and queries, and up to 5 walls), an efficient solution is essential.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The key challenge is efficiently checking for each artillery and watchtower pair whether the line of sight is obstructed by any defensive walls. A direct approach of checking each pair against all walls for every query would be computationally expensive (O(N*M*Q)), which is infeasible for large inputs.

2. **Insight**: Since the number of walls (M) is small (â‰¤ 5), we can preprocess for each artillery the list of walls that lie below it (i.e., walls with a y-coordinate less than the artillery's y-coordinate). This reduces the number of checks per query to at most 5 per artillery.

3. **Algorithm Selection**:
   - **Preprocessing**: For each artillery, store the indices of walls below it.
   - **Query Processing**: For each query (watchtower position), iterate over all artilleries. For each artillery, check only the walls in its precomputed list to determine if the line of sight is blocked. The blocking condition is verified using integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point inaccuracies.

4. **Complexity Analysis**:
   - **Preprocessing**: O(N*M) = 40,000 * 5 = 200,000 operations.
   - **Query Processing**: O(Q*N*M) = 40,000 * 40,000 * 5 = 8,000,000,000 operations in the worst case. While this is high, optimizations like efficient data structures and early termination mitigate the practical runtime.

#include <cstdint>
using namespace std;

struct Artillery {
    int x, y;

        artilleries[i].count = 0;
    }

    vector<Wall> walls_list(M);
    for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {

    }

    for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            if (artilleries[i].y > walls_list[j].y0) {
                artilleries[i].walls_below[artilleries[i].count] = j;
                artilleries[i].count++;
            }
        }
    }

    for (int q = 0; q < Q; q++) {
        int x_t, y_t;
        cin >> x_t >> y_t;

        int count_visible = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            bool blocked = false;
            int x_i = artilleries[i].x;
            int y_i = artilleries[i].y;
            for (int k = 0; k < artilleries[i].count; k++) {
                int wall_idx = artilleries[i].walls_below[k];
                const Wall& w = walls_list[wall_idx];
                int64_t base = (int64_t)(y_i - y_t);
                int64_t num = (int64_t)x_t * (y_i - w.y0) + (int64_t)x_i * (w.y0 - y_t);
                int64_t L_bound = (int64_t)w.x1 * base;
                int64_t R_bound = (int64_t)w.x2 * base;
                if (num >= L_bound && num <= R_bound) {
                    blocked = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!blocked) {
                count_visible++;
            }
        }
        cout << count_visible << '\n';
    }

    return 0;
}

### Explanation
1. **Input Reading**: The code reads the number of artilleries (N), walls (M), and queries (Q). It then reads the coordinates of the artilleries and walls.
2. **Preprocessing**: For each artillery, it stores the indices of walls that lie below it (based on y-coordinate comparison).
3. **Query Processing**: For each query (watchtower position), the code checks each artillery. For each artillery, it checks only the walls in its precomputed list. The blocking condition is verified by:
   - Calculating the intersection point's x-coordinate (using integer arithmetic) of the line segment between the watchtower and artillery with the wall's y-coordinate.
   - Checking if this x-coordinate lies within the wall's x-bounds.
4. **Output**: The count of visible artilleries (those not blocked by any wall) is output for each query.

This approach efficiently handles the constraints by leveraging preprocessing and careful integer arithmetic, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs. The worst-case complexity is manageable due to the small number of walls.
