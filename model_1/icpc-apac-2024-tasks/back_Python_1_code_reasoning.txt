 We are going to solve the problem as described in the editorial.

 Steps:
 1. Use Dijkstra to compute the shortest path from node 1 (d1) and from node n (dn) to all nodes.
 2. Check if there is a path from 1 to n: if d1[n] is INF, output -1.
 3. Reconstruct the base path (the shortest path from 1 to n) to mark which nodes and edges are on that path.
 4. Compute the second shortest path from 1 to n (which may use non-simple paths) using a Dijkstra variant that tracks two distances per node.
 5. For each edge not on the base path:
    a. If both endpoints are on the base path: 
        candidate_B1 = 2 * base_time - (absolute difference in d1 between the two nodes) + edge_time
        Why? Because we can use the edge as a shortcut for one direction and then the base path for the rest, but note that in the other direction we have to use the entire base path. Actually, the idea is: 
        In the round trip, we are going to use the entire base path twice (2*T) but we can avoid a segment of the base path in one direction by taking the detour edge. The segment we avoid has a length that is the absolute difference of d1[u] and d1[v] (because they are consecutive in the base path? Not exactly consecutive, but the entire segment between them). However, note that the detour edge replaces the segment. But wait: in the base path the segment between u and v is |d1[u]-d1[v]|. Then if we use the edge in one direction, we save the segment and add the edge. However, we have to account for the fact that we are doing a round trip: 
        - One way: we use the base path (time = T).
        - The other way: we use the base path until u, then the detour edge (which replaces the segment from u to v) and then the rest of the base path? But note: the detour edge is not the entire segment. Actually, we are replacing the segment from u to v (which is |d1[u]-d1[v]|) by the edge t. Then the second journey becomes: T - |d1[u]-d1[v]| + t.
        - Total = T + (T - |d1[u]-d1[v]| + t) = 2*T - |d1[u]-d1[v]| + t.

        However, note: the requirement is that the sets of roads must be distinct. By replacing the segment with a different edge, we are indeed changing the set.

    b. If at least one endpoint is not on the base path:
        We consider two possibilities for the detour: 
          Option 1: from 1 to u (using d1[u]), then the edge (u,v) (time t), then from v to n (using dn[v]).
          Option 2: from 1 to v (d1[v]), then the edge (v,u) (time t), then from u to n (dn[u]).
        Then the total for the round trip would be: 
          base_time (for the forward journey) + (d1[u] + t + dn[v])   for one detour in the backward? 
        Actually, we can do:
          One journey: the base path (time T)
          The other journey: we go from 1 to u, then edge to v, then to n. That journey takes d1[u] + t + dn[v]. But then the total time is T + d1[u] + t + dn[v]. 
        However, note: the base journey uses the base path, and the other journey uses a different set? But the problem does not require one journey to be the base and the other to be the detour. Actually, we are free to assign the two journeys arbitrarily. But note: we must go from 1 to n and then back from n to 1. We can do:
          Forward: base path (T)
          Backward: from n to v (dn[v]), then edge to u (t), then from u to 1 (d1[u]) -> total for backward: dn[v] + t + d1[u] = d1[u] + t + dn[v] (same as above).
        Then the total is T + (d1[u] + t + dn[v]). 

        But wait: we could also do:
          Forward: go from 1 to u, then edge to v, then to n: (d1[u] + t + dn[v])
          Backward: the base path: T
        Same total.

        However, what if we use the detour in both directions? Actually, the problem requires two distinct routes for the two traversals. We are using two distinct routes: one is the base path, the other is the detour path.

        So candidate_B4 = min(candidate_B4, T + d1[u] + t + dn[v], T + d1[v] + t + dn[u])

 6. Candidate_A: the sum of the shortest path (T) and the second shortest path (which might be a path that is not simple? but we computed it with our Dijkstra that allows revisiting nodes? Actually, we are tracking two distances per node: the shortest and the second shortest. The second shortest might be a path that uses a different set of edges. Then we can do:
        Forward: the base path (T)
        Backward: the second shortest path (dist1[n]) 
        Total = T + dist1[n]

 7. Then we take the minimum of candidate_A, candidate_B1, candidate_B4.

 However, note: the requirement is that the two sets of distinct roads must be different. The second shortest path (if it exists) is a different set? Yes, because if it were the same set it would be the same path? But note: we might have two different paths that use the same set of edges? Actually, the set of distinct roads is the set of edges. The second shortest path must use at least one edge that is not in the base path? Not necessarily: it could use the same edges in a different order? But then the set of edges would be the same. However, note: the problem says "set of distinct" roads. So if the second shortest path uses a different set of edges, then it's distinct. But if the second shortest path uses the same set of edges (like a cycle) then the set is the same? 

 Actually, the problem says: "Two routes are considered different if the set of distinct roads traversed through one route is different from the set of distinct roads traversed through the other route."

 Therefore, if the second shortest path uses the same set of edges as the base path, then it is not distinct. However, note that our method for second shortest path does not guarantee a distinct set. We are just computing the second smallest total time. 

 But observe: the base path is the shortest. The second shortest might be:
   - A path that goes through a cycle? Then the set of edges would be the same as the base path plus the cycle? Then the set is different? So it would be acceptable.

 However, the problem does not require the paths to be simple. So the second shortest path might be acceptable even if it uses extra edges (which would make the set distinct).

 Therefore, candidate_A is valid as long as the second shortest path exists.

 8. But note: the problem requires the two traversals to be distinct. We can assign the base path for the forward and the second shortest for the backward? Then the sets of edges in the two traversals are the sets of edges in the base path and the sets of edges in the second shortest path. They might be different? 

 However, the problem does not require the entire journey to be two distinct simple paths. It allows passing through the same city or road multiple times.

 Important: we must account for the possibility that the second shortest path might be the same set? How? Actually, we cannot easily check the set of edges. But note: if the second shortest path is a different set, then we are good. However, if the second shortest path is the same set (like the same edges but in a different order? but that would be the same set) then it is not distinct. 

 But note: the problem says "set of distinct" roads. So if the two traversals use exactly the same roads (the same set) then they are not distinct. However, the second shortest path might be a different set. How do we know? 

 Actually, our candidate_A is computed as the sum of the base path and the second shortest path. We are not enforcing that the second shortest path must have a distinct set. Therefore, we might have a candidate that is invalid? 

 However, the problem says: "Two routes are considered different if the set of distinct roads traversed through one route is different from the set of distinct roads traversed through the other route." 

 The second shortest path we compute is a path that might use a different set. But if the second shortest path is the same set as the base path, then we cannot use candidate_A. How to avoid that?

 But note: if the second shortest path is the same set as the base path, then it must be the same path? Because if the set of edges is the same, then the path is the same? Not necessarily: we might traverse the same set of edges but in a different order? However, the set of distinct roads is the same. Therefore, the sets are the same. So we cannot use candidate_A in that case.

 However, how likely is it that the second shortest path has the same set? Actually, the second shortest path might be the same path with a detour (a cycle) then the set is different (it includes the cycle edges). So it is distinct.

 Therefore, the second shortest path we compute (if it is a different value from the base) must have a distinct set? Because it uses at least one edge that the base does not, or avoids an edge that the base uses? 

 Actually, if the second shortest path is exactly the base path, then we would have dist0[n] = dist1[n]? Then we would have stored the same value twice? But we skip when we get the same distance: 
        if nd < dist0[v]: ... 
        elif nd != dist0[v] and nd < dist1[v]: ...

 So if the base path is the only path with that total time, then the second shortest path must be a different total time? And therefore, it must use a different set of edges? 

 However, consider: two different sets of edges can have the same total time. Then we would have the same distance for the base and the second? But we skip when nd==dist0[v]. Therefore, we are not storing that. 

 So the second shortest path we store is strictly greater than the base. Therefore, it must use a different set? Actually, it might use the same set? For example, if there is a cycle that adds zero time? But note: edge times are positive. So the second shortest path must be strictly greater. And if it is strictly greater, then it must use at least one extra edge (which is not in the base) or avoid one edge of the base? Actually, avoiding an edge of the base would require a detour that uses different edges. Therefore, the set must be different.

 Therefore, candidate_A is valid.

 9. However, note: the problem does not require the two traversals to be simple. We can have the same node multiple times. And the second shortest path we compute is the minimal time for a path that is not the base? But it might be the base path with an extra cycle? Then the set of distinct edges would be the base set plus the cycle edges. So it is distinct. Therefore, candidate_A is valid.

 10. But note: the problem requires the two traversals to have distinct sets. We are using the base for one and the second shortest for the other. Since the second shortest path is different from the base (because it has a different total time and because it must use a different set of edges) then it is distinct.

 11. Therefore, we compute:
        candidate_A = base_time + second_shortest_time   (if second_shortest_time exists, i.e., dist1[n] < INF)

 12. Then we consider the other two candidates.

 13. However, note: the problem does not require the two traversals to be independent. We can use one of the traversals to be the base path and the other to be a detour that might use a different set.

 14. Implementation note: we must mark the base path nodes and edges.

 How to reconstruct the base path?
        We have parent_arr from the first Dijkstra (from 1). Then we start at n and backtrack until 1.

 15. For each edge (u, v, t) in the graph (we stored in edges), we check if it is on the base path by:
        Let a = min(u, v), b = max(u, v). Then we check if (a, b) is in base_edges.

 16. For candidate_B1: only for edges that are not on the base path and have both endpoints in base_nodes.

 17. For candidate_B4: edges that are not on the base path and at least one endpoint not in base_nodes? Actually, we can also consider edges with both endpoints in base_nodes? But we already handled those in candidate_B1. So we skip base_edges and then for the rest, we do candidate_B1 for the ones that are both in base_nodes, and candidate_B4 for the others.

 18. However, note: an edge with both endpoints in base_nodes might be a chord that is not the direct segment? Then we can use it as a detour. That's candidate_B1.

 19. Then we take the minimum of candidate_A, candidate_B1, candidate_B4. If none is less than INF, then output -1.

 20. But note: the problem says that the two traversals must be distinct. Our candidate_B1 and candidate_B4 also yield distinct sets? 
        For candidate_B1: 
            One traversal: the base path (set = base_edges)
            The other traversal: we break the base path at two points and use the chord. So the set of edges: 
                The base_edges without the segment between u and v, and then add the chord edge. Therefore, the set is different.

        For candidate_B4:
            One traversal: base_edges
            The other traversal: goes from 1 to u (which is on the base) then the chord to v (which is off the base) then from v to n (which is not the base path). Therefore, the set of edges is base_edges for the first and a set that includes the chord and the edges from 1 to u (which is part of the base) and from v to n (which might not be entirely base? Actually, the base path from v to n might not be used because v is off the base). But note: the set is different because it includes the chord and possibly edges not in the base (from v to n) and excludes the base path from u to the next base node? Actually, the entire base path from u to n is not used? 

        Actually, the backward journey (from n to 1) is defined as: n->...->v, then the chord to u, then u->...->1. The set of edges: 
            The chord (u,v) is not in the base? 
            The edges from n to v: these are not in the base? Because v is not on the base path? Actually, we defined base_nodes as the nodes on the base path. If v is not in base_nodes, then the path from n to v is not the base path? It is the shortest path from n to v (which we computed) and it might not use base_edges? 

        But note: the set of edges for the backward journey is the union of the chord and the edges in the path from 1 to u (which is a prefix of the base) and the edges in the path from v to n (which is a suffix of the base? no, because v is not on the base). Therefore, the set is distinct from the base set.

 21. Therefore, all candidates are valid.

 22. However, note: we must consider that the entire journey is a round trip: 
        Forward: 1 -> n
        Backward: n -> 1

        But we can assign the detour to either the forward or the backward? Actually, the problem does not specify which traversal uses which set. We can assign arbitrarily. Therefore, we are free to choose.

        For candidate_B1: we described the backward journey as the one with the detour? But actually, we computed the total time as 2*T - (segment) + t. This formula is symmetric: it doesn't matter which traversal uses the detour.

        Similarly, candidate_B4: we computed T + (d1[u] + t + dn[v]) which is symmetric in the assignment.

 23. Therefore, the code as described.

 Special note: the problem says that the same road can be traversed multiple times and the time is added for each traversal.

 24. Let's test with the sample: 
        Input: "3 2\n1 2 10\n1 3 5"

        Base path: 1->3 (time=5). Then T=5.
        Second shortest: we can go 1->2->3? But wait, we don't have an edge from 2 to 3. Actually, the sample input has two edges: (1,2) and (1,3). So the base path is 1->3 (5). The second shortest: we can go 1->2 and then ... we cannot go to 3? So the second shortest is INF? 

        But the sample output is 30.

        How do they get 30?
            Forward: 1->3 (5) -> set { (1,3) }
            Backward: 3->1 (using edge (1,3) again? but then the set is the same -> not allowed). 
            Instead, they do: 3->1 via edge (1,3) and then 1->2 via (1,2) and then 2->1 via (1,2) and then 1->3? That doesn't make sense.

        Actually, the sample explanation says:
            Travel from city 1 to city 3: time 5 (set {2} -> note: edge2 is (1,3))
            Travel from city 3 to city 1: 
                go from 3 to 1 via edge2 (5) -> then from 1 to 2 via edge1 (10) -> then from 2 to 1 via edge1 (10) -> total 25? 
            Then the set for the backward journey: {edge1, edge2} which is different from {edge2} of the forward.

        Total time: 5+25 = 30.

        How do we capture that?

        In our candidate_B4: 
            We have an edge (1,2) which is not on the base path. 
            One endpoint (1) is on the base path, the other (2) is not? Actually, the base path is [1,3]. So 2 is not on the base path.

            Then candidate_B4 = T + min( d1[1] + 10 + dn[2], d1[2] + 10 + dn[1] )
            d1[1]=0, dn[2]=? 
            We computed dn (from n=3): 
                dn[3]=0
                dn[1] = min( from 3: 5? ) -> so dn[1]=5
                dn[2]: we have no direct edge from 2 to 3? So we have to go 2->1->3: 10+5=15.

            Then:
                Option1: d1[1] + 10 + dn[2] = 0+10+15 = 25
                Option2: d1[2] + 10 + dn[1] = 10+10+5 = 25
            Then candidate_B4 = 5 + 25 = 30.

        Then our candidate_B4 would be 30.

        Also candidate_A: 
            We need the second shortest from 1 to n (which is 3). The base path is 5. 
            The next path: we can go 1->2->1->3: 10+10+5=25? But that would be a path of 25. Then candidate_A = 5+25=30.

        So we have candidate_A=30 and candidate_B4=30. Then we take 30.

        Why candidate_B1 is not considered? Because the edge (1,2) is not connecting two base nodes? Actually, base nodes are {1,3}. The edge (1,2) has one base node (1) and one non-base (2). So it goes to candidate_B4.

 25. Another sample: 
        "4 3\n1 2 10\n2 3 5\n3 4 2"

        Base path: 1->2->3->4: time = 10+5+2 = 17.
        Second shortest: we must have a path that uses the same set? Actually, we cannot avoid any edge? Then second_shortest might be INF? 

        candidate_B1: no edge that is not on the base path and both endpoints on the base? 
        candidate_B4: no edge that is not on the base path? because all edges are base? 

        Then we output -1.

 26. Sample Input #3: 
        "4 4\n1 2 3\n2 4 2\n1 3 3\n3 4 4"

        Base path: 
            From 1 to 4: 
                1->2->4: 3+2 = 5
                1->3->4: 3+4 = 7 -> so base path is 5 (using edges (1,2) and (2,4))

        Then base_edges = {(1,2), (2,4)}? But note: 2 and 4: the edge (2,4) is represented as (2,4) -> min=2, max=4.

        Then the other edges: 
            (1,3): 3 -> represented as (1,3)
            (3,4): 4 -> represented as (3,4)

        candidate_A: second_shortest path from 1 to 4: 
            base: 5
            next: 
                1->3->4: 3+4=7 -> candidate_A = 5+7=12.

        candidate_B1: we look for edges that are not base and both endpoints in base_nodes. 
            base_nodes: from 1->2->4: {1,2,4}
            edge (1,3): 1 is base, 3 is not -> candidate_B4
            edge (3,4): 3 is not, 4 is base -> candidate_B4

        candidate_B4: 
            For (1,3): 
                cand1 = T + (d1[1] + 3 + dn[3]) = 5 + (0+3+dn[3])
                dn[3]: from 4 to 3: the base path doesn't cover 3? We have to compute dn: 
                    dn[4]=0
                    dn[2]=2 (from 4 to 2 via edge (2,4))
                    dn[1]=min(2+3=5, ...) -> but we have no direct from 1 to 4? Actually, we have 1->2->4: 3+2=5, so dn[1]=min(5, ...) -> but wait, we computed dn from 4: 
                        4->2: 2, 2->1: 3 -> so dn[1]=5.
                    dn[3]: from 4: we can go 4->3? no, we have an edge (3,4) so 4->3: 4? Then dn[3]=4.
                Then cand1 = 5 + (0+3+4) = 12.
                cand2 = 5 + (d1[3] + 3 + dn[1]) -> d1[3]: from 1 to 3: 3 (via edge (1,3))? Actually, base path didn't go that way, but we computed d1 from 1: 
                    d1[1]=0, d1[2]=3, d1[4]=5, d1[3]=? 
                    We have an edge 1->3: 3, so d1[3]=3.
                Then cand2 = 5 + (3+3+5) = 5+11=16 -> so min(cand1, cand2)=12.

            For (3,4): 
                cand1 = T + (d1[3] + 4 + dn[4]) = 5 + (3+4+0)=12
                cand2 = T + (d1[4] + 4 + dn[3]) = 5 + (5+4+4)=18 -> so 12.

            Then candidate_B4 = 12.

        Then the answer is min(12, candidate_B1 (which is INF), 12) = 12.

 27. Therefore, we output 12.

 28. Sample Input #4: 
        "3 1\n1 2 1000"

        Then base path: from 1 to 3? But there is no edge to 3. So d1[3] = INF -> output -1.

 29. Code Implementation:

        We do:
          d1: shortest from 1
          dn: shortest from n

          If d1[n] is INF: print -1 and return.

          Then reconstruct base path: 
            base_nodes = set()
            base_edges = set()   # store as (min(u,v), max(u,v))

          Then compute second shortest from 1 to n: 
            dist0[i] = shortest time from 1 to i
            dist1[i] = second shortest time from 1 to i

          Then for each edge in the list of edges (which we stored as (u, v, t)):
            if the edge (min(u,v), max(u,v)) is in base_edges: skip.
            else:
                if u in base_nodes and v in base_nodes:
                    seg = abs(d1[u] - d1[v])   # because the base path from u to v is |d1[u]-d1[v]|? 
                    candidate_B1 = min(candidate_B1, 2*T - seg + t)
                else:
                    cand1 = T + d1[u] + t + dn[v]
                    cand2 = T + d1[v] + t + dn[u]
                    candidate_B4 = min(candidate_B4, cand1, cand2)

          candidate_A = T + dist1[n]   (if dist1[n] is INF, then candidate_A remains INF)

          Then ans = min(candidate_A, candidate_B1, candidate_B4)

          If ans is INF: print -1
          Else: print ans

 30. Important: when reconstructing the base path, we have the parent pointers from the first Dijkstra. We start at n and go backwards until 1. Then we mark every node we go through as base_nodes. For the edges: for each step from cur to parent_arr[cur], we form the edge (min(cur, parent_arr[cur]), max(cur, parent_arr[cur]) and add to base_edges.

 31. But note: the base path might not be unique? However, we are using the parent_arr that we built in the first Dijkstra. We break ties arbitrarily? The problem states: "different roads connect different pairs of cities" and the graph is undirected. We are building the parent_arr arbitrarily? Actually, the base path we reconstruct is one shortest path.

 32. However, for candidate_B1: we are only considering edges that are not in base_edges. And the segment we remove is the segment between u and v on the base path. But note: the base path we reconstructed is one specific path. There might be multiple shortest paths? 

        But the problem says: "the set of distinct roads". We are using the base_edges from one base path. The requirement is that the two traversals must have distinct sets. So we can use the other base path? 

        Actually, we are not storing all base paths. We are storing one. Therefore, candidate_B1 might miss an alternative base path? 

        However, the problem does not require the entire journey to use the same base path for both? We can use one base path for the forward and then a different base path for the backward? Then the two sets would be different? 

        But note: if there are multiple base paths (same total time) then we can use one for the forward and the other for the backward. Then candidate_A would be T + T = 2*T? 

        How do we capture that? 

        Our candidate_A: 
            We have the base path (dist0[n]=T) and the second shortest path (dist1[n]) which must be >= T. But if there is an alternative base path (also T), then we would have stored that as the second shortest? 

            In our Dijkstra for two distances: 
                We push the same distance? 
                We do: 
                    if nd < dist0[v]: 
                        dist1[v] = dist0[v]
                        dist0[v] = nd
                    elif nd != dist0[v] and nd < dist1[v]:
                        dist1[v] = nd

            So if we find an alternative path of the same time (T), then we set dist1[v] = T. Then candidate_A = T + T = 2*T.

        Then that would be a candidate: 2*T.

        But note: the sets of edges of the two base paths are different? Then we are good.

        However, what if the two base paths use the same set of edges? Then the sets are the same? 

        But the problem says: "the set of distinct roads". The set of edges used in the entire path. If the two paths use the same set of edges (even if they traverse them in different orders) then the set is the same. 

        How to avoid that? 

        Actually, we cannot avoid: if two different paths use the same set of edges, then they are not distinct? 

        But note: two different paths that use the same set of edges? That would require the graph to have multiple edges? The problem says: different roads connect different pairs of cities. So no multiple edges. 

        Then the set of edges for a path is the set of edges traversed. Two different paths must have different sets? 

        Actually, not necessarily: one path might use a subset? 

        But two base paths (with the same total time) might be two different sets? 

        Therefore, if we have two base paths that are distinct (different sets), then we can use one for the forward and one for the backward. Then the total time is 2*T and candidate_A would be 2*T.

        Then we would have an answer of 2*T.

        But note: the problem says: the two traversals must be distinct. This satisfies.

        However, what if the two base paths are the same set? That happens if they are the same path? But then we are traversing the same set twice. So that is not distinct. 

        But if there are two different base paths (so they are two different sets) then we can use them.

        How do we know if there is an alternative base path? 

        Our second shortest path algorithm: if we get a path of the same time (T) then we set dist1[n]=T. Then candidate_A = 2*T.

        But if the two base paths have the same set? Then we cannot use candidate_A? 

        Actually, two different base paths must have different sets? Because they are two different sequences of edges? And since the graph has no multiple edges, the set of edges is determined by the edges traversed. Two different paths (different sequences) might use the same set? For example: 
            Path1: 1->2->3->4
            Path2: 1->3->2->4   [if we have edges (1,3), (3,2), (2,4)] -> then the set for Path1: {(1,2),(2,3),(3,4)} and for Path2: {(1,3),(3,2),(2,4)} -> different sets.

        Therefore, if we have two base paths, they are distinct sets.

        Therefore, candidate_A=2*T is valid.

        Then we don't need to worry.

 33. But note: the problem does not require the two traversals to be simple. So the second traversal might be the same base path as the first but with a cycle? Then the set would be the base set plus the cycle. Then the set is distinct. Then candidate_A might be T (for the base) and T+cycle_time (for the base plus cycle) = 2*T+cycle_time. But if there is an alternative base path, then we get 2*T which is better.

 34. Therefore, we are good.

 35. Let's test with a graph with two base paths (same total time). 
        Example: 
          4 4
          1 2 1
          1 3 1
          2 4 1
          3 4 1

        Then the base path: 1->2->4 (time=2) or 1->3->4 (time=2). 
        candidate_A: 
            dist0[4]=2, then we also get the other path: when we are at 2, we push 1->2->4=2. Then at 4, we have:
                first time: 2 (from 1->2->4)
                then we get 1->3->4: 2 -> and we set dist1[4]=2? 
            candidate_A = 2+2 = 4.

        candidate_B1: edges that are not base? 
            We reconstructed one base path: say 1->2->4. Then base_edges = {(1,2), (2,4)}. 
            Then the other edges: (1,3) and (3,4) are not base_edges. 
            For (1,3): one endpoint in base (1) and one not (3)? Actually, base_nodes: {1,2,4} -> 3 is not in base_nodes. So candidate_B4: 
                For (1,3): 
                    cand1 = T + d1[1] + 1 + dn[3] = 2 + 0+1+dn[3] 
                    dn[3]: from 4 to 3: 1 (via edge (3,4)) -> then 2+ (0+1+1)=4.
                    cand2 = T + d1[3] + 1 + dn[1] = 2 + (1+1+2) = 6 -> so 4.

            Similarly for (3,4): 
                cand1 = T + d1[3] + 1 + dn[4] = 2 + (1+1+0)=4
                cand2 = T + d1[4] + 1 + dn[3] = 2 + (2+1+1)=6 -> so 4.

        candidate_B1: we have no edge with both endpoints in base_nodes and not base? The chord (1,4) doesn't exist. 

        Then the answer = min(4, INF, 4) = 4.

        But note: we could also use candidate_A=4.

        Then 4 is the answer.

 36. Therefore, the code as described.

 37. However, note: the segment time in candidate_B1: 
        We have an edge (u,v) that is a chord on the base path. We assume the segment time between u and v on the base path is |d1[u]-d1[v]|. 

        Why? 
          Because the base path from 1 to n is a shortest path. Therefore, the segment from u to v on the base path is the unique shortest path between u and v? Not necessarily: the base path might not be the only path? But we have a chord that we are considering as a candidate because it is not the base edge? 

        However, the segment time must be the difference? Because d1[u] is the distance from 1 to u, and d1[v] is the distance from 1 to v. If u is closer to 1 than v, then the segment from u to v is d1[v]-d1[u]. 

        Therefore, seg = abs(d1[u]-d1[v]) is the length of the base path segment between u and v.

        But note: there might be a shorter path? Then the base path would have taken that? 

        Therefore, the segment time is the absolute difference.

 38. But what if the base path goes from u to v via a detour? Actually, the base path is the shortest path from 1 to n. The segment from u to v must be the shortest path from u to v? Otherwise, we could replace that segment by a shorter one. 

        So yes, the segment from u to v on the base path is the shortest path from u to v.

        Therefore, the segment time is the absolute difference.

 39. Code for candidate_B1: 
        candidate = 2*T - abs(d1[u]-d1[v]) + t

 40. Let's test candidate_B1 with an example: 
        Consider a base path: 1->2->3->4. 
        Suppose we have an edge (2,4) with time x. 
        The segment from 2 to 4 on the base path: 2->3->4: time = w23+w34.
        Then candidate_B1 = 2*T - (w23+w34) + x.

        But note: the entire journey: 
          Forward: the base path: T
          Backward: we go from 4 to 2 via the chord (4,2) (time x) and then from 2 to 1 (base path: w12). But then how do we get from 4 to 1? 
            Actually, we break the backward journey: 
                We go from 4 to 2 (via the chord) -> time x
                Then from 2 to 1: w12 -> total backward: x + w12
            Total = T + (x + w12)

        But the base path backward (without detour) is T (if we traverse the same base path backwards: 4->3->2->1: T). 

        How is that equal to 2*T - (w23+w34) + x?
          2*T = w12 + w23 + w34 + w12 + w23 + w34?   -> no, wait T = w12+w23+w34.

          Then 2*T - (w23+w34) + x = 2*(w12+w23+w34) - (w23+w34) + x = 2*w12 + w23 + w34 + x.

          And T + x + w12 = (w12+w23+w34) + x + w12 = 2*w12 + w23 + w34 + x.

        So they are equal.

        Therefore, the formula holds.

 41. Implementation:

        We assume the graph is undirected and the base path is a simple path.

        We do:
          d1: from 1 to all
          dn: from n to all

          Reconstruct base path: 
            cur = n
            base_nodes = [n]
            base_edges = set()
            while cur != 1:
                prev = parent_arr[cur]
                base_nodes.append(prev)
                u = min(prev, cur)
                v = max(prev, cur)
                base_edges.add((u, v))
                cur = prev

          Then base_nodes = set(base_nodes)

        Then run the second shortest path algorithm (with two distances per node).

        Then initialize:
            candidate_A = INF
            candidate_B1 = INF
            candidate_B4 = INF

        If dist1[n] < INF: candidate_A = T + dist1[n]

        For each edge (u, v, t) in edges:
            if (min(u,v), max(u,v)) in base_edges: skip
            else:
                if u in base_nodes and v in base_nodes:
                    seg = abs(d1[u] - d1[v])
                    candidate_B1 = min(candidate_B1, 2*T - seg + t)
                else:
                    cand1 = T + d1[u] + t + dn[v]
                    cand2 = T + d1[v] + t + dn[u]
                    candidate_B4 = min(candidate_B4, cand1, cand2)

        ans = min(candidate_A, candidate_B1, candidate_B4)

        if ans >= INF: print(-1)
        else: print(ans)

 42. However, note: the segment time in candidate_B1 must be the actual segment time? But if the base path does not have a contiguous segment from u to v? Actually, the base path is a simple path. The nodes u and v are on the base path. Then the segment between u and v is contiguous? And the time is the absolute difference? 

        But what if the base path visits u and then later visits v? Then the segment time is |d1[u]-d1[v]|.

        However, if the base path visits u and then v in that order, then d1[v] = d1[u] + (segment time). So the segment time = d1[v]-d1[u]. And we take the absolute value? 

        Actually, we don't know the order: but the base path is from 1 to n. So if d1[u] < d1[v], then the base path goes from u to v, and the segment time = d1[v]-d1[u]. If d1[u] > d1[v], then the base path goes from v to u, and the segment time = d1[u]-d1[v]. So absolute difference is correct.

 43. Therefore, we use abs(d1[u]-d1[v]).

 44. We'll code accordingly.

 45. Time complexity: 
        Dijkstra for d1: O((n+m) log n)
        Dijkstra for dn: same
        Reconstruct base path: O(n)
        Second shortest path: O((n+m) log n) (each node can be popped at most twice, and each edge relaxed at most twice)
        Then iterating over m edges: O(m)

        Total: O((n+m) log n) which is acceptable for n<=100000, m<=300000.

 46. Let's code accordingly.

 47. Note: we must use sys.stdin for large inputs.

 48. We'll write the code as described.

 49. Sample Input #2: 
        4 3
        1 2 10
        2 3 5
        3 4 2

        Base path: 1->2->3->4: T=17.
        Second shortest: we don't have any alternative edge? So dist1[4] remains INF.

        candidate_B1: no edge that is not base? because there are only 3 edges and all are base? -> skip.

        candidate_B4: no edge that is not base? skip.

        Then ans = INF -> output -1.

 50. Therefore, we output -1.

 51. Code for second shortest path:

        We'll initialize:
            dist0 = [INF]*(n+1)
            dist1 = [INF]*(n+1)
            heap = min-heap of (distance, node)

            dist0[1]=0
            push (0,1)

        While heap:
            pop the smallest (d, u)
            if d > dist1[u]: skip
            for each neighbor (v, w):
                nd = d + w
                if nd < dist0[v]:
                    dist1[v] = dist0[v]   # push the old best to second best
                    dist0[v] = nd
                    push (nd, v)
                elif nd != dist0[v] and nd < dist1[v]:
                    dist1[v] = nd
                    push (nd, v)

        Note: we push even if we update the second best? Yes.

 52. We'll run this from node 1.

 53. Let's run the sample with 3 2 (the first sample) to see if we get the second shortest for node 3 (which is n=3) as 25? 
        But note: the second shortest path we are computing is for the entire path from 1 to 3? 

        Actually, we want the second shortest path from 1 to 3? 
        We have:
            base: 1->3: 5 -> dist0[3]=5.
            Then what is the second? 
                We can do: 1->2->1->3: 
                    1->2: 10, then 2->1: 10, then 1->3:5 -> total 25.

            How does the algorithm get that?
                We start at 1: dist0[1]=0, dist1[1]=INF.
                We push (0,1)
                Pop (0,1): 
                    relax to 2: dist0[2]=10 -> push (10,2)
                    relax to 3: dist0[3]=5 -> push (5,3)
                Then pop (5,3): done? 

                Then we pop (10,2): 
                    from 2: 
                        to 1: 10+10=20 -> then at node 1: 
                            dist0[1]=0, 20>0 -> so try to update dist1[1]: 20 < INF -> so dist1[1]=20, push (20,1)
                        to 3: 10+? -> but there's no edge from 2 to 3? 
                Then we pop (20,1): 
                    from 1: 
                        to 2: 20+10=30 -> at 2: compare with dist0[2]=10 -> skip? and then with dist1[2]=INF -> set dist1[2]=30? push (30,2) [but not necessary?]
                        to 3: 20+5=25 -> at 3: 
                            dist0[3]=5, 25>5 -> then check if 25 < dist1[3] (which is INF) -> set dist1[3]=25, push (25,3)

                Then we have dist1[3]=25.

            Then candidate_A = dist0[3] + dist1[3] = 5+25=30.

        So it works.

 54. Therefore, we code accordingly.

 55. We'll run the code on the provided samples.

 56. Note: we assume that the second shortest path might be a path that revisits nodes? and we are allowing that.

 57. We write the code accordingly.

 58. One more note: the graph is undirected.

 59. We are done.

 Let's code accordingly.
