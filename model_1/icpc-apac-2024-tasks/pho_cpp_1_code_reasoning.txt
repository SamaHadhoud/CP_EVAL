 We are going to read the input and process each table.
 Steps:
 1. Read n and then n binary strings.
 2. We need:
    - total_contestants: the sum of the lengths of all strings.
    - saving0: the total maximum contestants we can leave at each table (without moving) if we set the table to the majority dish.
    - But note: we must have at least one table set to dish 0 if there is at least one contestant that wants dish 0? Actually, the requirement is that each table must be uniform. However, note that the entire set of contestants must be assigned to the tables (without adding new tables). But we are allowed to have empty tables? Yes, condition says "either there is no contestant or all have the same dish".

 However, the problem does not require that every dish type (0 and 1) must be present at some table. It only requires that at each table, either all are 0 or all are 1. But note: if a dish type (say 0) is present in the entire set, then we must have at least one table that is set to 0? Actually, no: we can have all the zeros at one table and the ones at others? But wait: if there is a contestant that wants dish 0, then we must assign him to a table that is set to dish 0. So we must have at least one table set to dish 0 if there is at least one contestant that wants dish 0. Similarly for dish 1.

 However, the problem does not require that each table must be non-empty. So we can have one table set to 0 and another set to 1, and the rest empty? That is acceptable.

 Therefore, after moving, we must have:
   - For dish 0: at least one table that is set to dish 0 (if there is at least one contestant that wants dish 0).
   - For dish 1: at least one table that is set to dish 1 (if there is at least one contestant that wants dish 1).

 But note: we can set a table to dish 0 even if originally the majority was dish 1? However, we have already computed the saving for each table by taking the majority. But if we force a table that was naturally set to dish 1 to become dish 0, we have to change the saving: we lose the majority saving and get the minority.

 How we handle?
   - For each table, we compute the minimal moves: min(count0, count1). Then the saving for that table is max(count0, count1).
   - Then we note: we require at least one table set to 0 (if total_zeros>0) and at least one table set to 1 (if total_ones>0).
   - Now, if we don't have any table naturally set to 0 (i.e., we have a table that by majority we set to 0) then we must convert one table that we set to 1 to 0? Actually, no: we might have set a table to the majority 1, but we can force it to 0 at an extra cost.

 How much extra cost? 
   Let for a table, if we set it to the majority (say 1) we leave `max(count0, count1)` = count1 contestants and move count0.
   If we force it to 0, then we leave count0 and move count1. The extra cost (loss) compared to the majority saving is: 
        saving_loss = count1 - count0   [because we are leaving count0 instead of count1, so we are saving count0 - count1 less? Actually, we are saving (count0) instead of (count1), so the saving is reduced by (count1 - count0)].

 Similarly, for forcing a table from 0 to 1: loss = count0 - count1.

 Steps:
   - We start by assuming we set each table to the majority dish. Then we have saving0 = sum(max(count0, count1)).
   - But if we don't have any table that by majority is set to 0 (meaning we set every table to 1) and there are zeros in the entire set (total_zeros>0), then we must force at least one table to 0. How? We choose a table for which the loss (count1 - count0) is minimal. Similarly for dish 1.

 However, note: we might have set a table to 1 even though it had more ones? But if we set a table to 0, we are going to lose (count1 - count0) saving. So we subtract that from the total saving.

 Similarly, if we don't have any table set to 1 (by majority) and total_ones>0, we must force one table to 1: we subtract the minimal loss (count0 - count1) from the total saving.

 But note: we might have a table that can be set to both? Then we don't need to force it.

 Actually, we set flags:
   has0: true if there is at least one table with count0>=count1 (so we set it to 0 and that counts as a table for dish0) OR if we set it to majority 0? Actually, our initial setting: we set the table to the majority dish. So if a table has count0>=count1, we set it to 0 -> then we have a table for dish0. Similarly, if count1>=count0, we set it to 1 -> then we have a table for dish1.

 But note: if a table has count0==count1, then we set it to either? Actually, we can set it to 0 or 1 arbitrarily? And in that case, both flags are set? Yes: because if count0>=count1 -> then we set to 0 (so has0 becomes true) and count1>=count0 -> then we set to 1 (so has1 becomes true). Actually, for count0==count1: we set it to either? Actually, we take max(count0,count1) and that is count0 (or count1, same) so we can choose arbitrarily? But in our saving, we leave count0 (which equals count1) so we move count1 (if we set to 0) or count0 (if set to 1). But note: we don't care because we are going to have both flags set? Actually, we set:
      if count0>=count1: then has0 = True
      if count1>=count0: then has1 = True
   So for a table with count0==count1, both conditions are true -> so both flags become true.

 Therefore, after processing all tables, we have:
   - If total_zeros>0 and has0 is false: then we must force one table to dish0. We look for the minimal loss (count1 - count0) for any table. We have stored in list_force0 the values (count1 - count0) for tables that originally had count0 < count1 (so they were set to 1). Why? Because if we force such a table to 0, the loss is (count1 - count0). Actually, note: for a table that was set to 1, we initially saved count1. If we force it to 0, we save count0, so the reduction in saving is (count1 - count0). Similarly, for a table that was set to 0 (with count0>=count1) we don't need to force? Actually, we already set it to 0 so we don't consider it for force0.

   Similarly, for dish1: if total_ones>0 and has1 is false, then we look for the minimal loss (count0 - count1) for any table that was originally set to 0 (so we have count1 < count0) and the loss is (count0 - count1).

 But note: what if we have a table that has count0==count1? Then we set it arbitrarily to 0 or 1? Actually, we don't need to force because we have both flags set? So we don't add it to list_force0 or list_force1? Actually, we don't add because condition: 
      if count0 < count1: we add to list_force0
      if count1 < count0: we add to list_force1

 Therefore, for count0==count1, we don't add to either list. That is okay because we already set both flags.

 Implementation:
   total_contestants = sum of lengths
   saving0 = 0
   has0 = false, has1 = false
   total_zeros = 0, total_ones = 0
   list_force0 = vector for the losses for forcing a table to 0 (that was set to 1) -> each element = count1 - count0
   list_force1 = vector for the losses for forcing a table to 1 (that was set to 0) -> each element = count0 - count1

   For each string:
        count0 = number of '0'
        count1 = len - count0
        total_zeros += count0
        total_ones += count1
        saving0 += max(count0, count1)

        if count0 >= count1: has0 = true
        if count1 >= count0: has1 = true

        if count0 < count1: then we can force it to 0 at a loss of (count1 - count0) -> push to list_force0
        if count1 < count0: then push (count0 - count1) to list_force1

   Then:
        if total_zeros > 0 and not has0:
            if list_force0 is empty? -> but note: if there are zeros and we don't have a table set to 0, then there must be at least one table that we can force? Actually, if there is a contestant that wants dish0, then there must be at least one table that has at least one dish0? But we have no table set to 0 by majority? Then we must force one of the tables that was set to 1 to become 0. But note: what if there is no table with count0>=count1? Then we have list_force0 for every table? Actually, no: what about a table that is all ones? Then count0=0, count1>0 -> then we set to 1, and we add the loss (count1 - count0) to list_force0? Actually, we do. And if there is a contestant that wants dish0, then total_zeros>0, so we require a table set to 0. So we pick the minimal loss from list_force0 and subtract that from saving0.

        Similarly, if total_ones > 0 and not has1: then subtract the minimal value in list_force1.

   Then the minimal moves = total_contestants - saving0.

 However, note: it is possible that both conditions occur? Then we subtract two losses? Actually, yes: we might have no table naturally set to 0 and no table naturally set to 1? That cannot happen because we set each table to the majority. Then if a table has count0>=count1 -> has0=true; if count1>=count0 -> has1=true. So if we have no table with count0>=count1, then every table has count0<count1 -> then we set every table to 1 -> then has1 is true? Actually, no: because we set has1 only if count1>=count0. And if every table has count0<count1, then for each table count1>=count0 is true? So has1 becomes true? Then why would we ever get not has1? 

 Let me check: 
   We set:
        if count0>=count1 -> set has0 = true (if not already true)
        if count1>=count0 -> set has1 = true (if not already true)

   For a table that is 100% ones: count0=0, count1=L -> then count0>=count1? 0>=L -> false. But count1>=count0? L>=0 -> true -> so has1 becomes true.

   Similarly, a table that is 100% zeros: has0 becomes true.

   So when do we get has0=false? Only when no table has count0>=count1? That is, every table has count0 < count1? Then we set every table to 1 -> so we have no table set to 0? But has0 remains false.

   Similarly, has1=false only when no table has count1>=count0? That is, every table has count1 < count0? Then we set every table to 0.

   Therefore, if we have both dish0 and dish1 in the entire set (total_zeros>0 and total_ones>0), then we must have at least one table set to 0 and one set to 1? Actually, if we set every table to 1, then we don't have a table set to 0? Then we must force one table to 0? Similarly, if we set every table to 0, then we don't have a table set to 1? Then we force one to 1.

   But what if we have only dish0? Then total_ones=0 -> then we don't care about has1? Similarly, only dish1: total_zeros=0 -> don't care about has0.

 Therefore, the conditions:

        if (total_zeros > 0 and not has0):
            saving0 -= min_force0   # where min_force0 = min(list_force0)

        if (total_ones > 0 and not has1):
            saving0 -= min_force1   # where min_force1 = min(list_force1)

 However, note: it is possible that we need to force both? For example, if we have two tables:
        Table1: "0" -> then count0=1, count1=0 -> we set to 0 -> has0=true, has1=false? Actually, condition: count1>=count0 -> 0>=1 -> false -> so has1 remains false? But wait: the table has count0>=count1 -> so we set has0=true. And for dish1: we have count1>=count0? false -> so has1 remains false? But note: we have no contestant that wants dish1? total_ones = 0? Then we don't check for has1.

 Therefore, we condition on total_ones>0.

 But what if we have:
        Table1: "0" -> total_ones=0 -> no problem for dish1.
        Table2: "1" -> total_zeros=0 -> no problem for dish0? Then we don't force anything.

 However, if we have:
        Table1: "01" -> then count0=1, count1=1 -> then we set has0=true and has1=true? Then we don't force.

        But what if we have two tables: 
            Table1: "0", Table2: "1"
            Then total_zeros=1, total_ones=1.
            For Table1: count0=1, count1=0 -> set to 0: has0=true, and condition for dish1: count1>=count0? 0>=1 -> false -> so has1 remains false? Then for Table2: count0=0, count1=1 -> set to 1: then condition: for Table2: count1>=count0 -> true -> so has1 becomes true.

        So both flags become true.

        Now consider two tables: 
            Table1: "00", Table2: "11"
            Then Table1: count0=2, count1=0 -> set to 0: has0=true, but for dish1: condition fails -> has1 remains false until we process Table2: then Table2: count0=0, count1=2 -> set to 1: then condition: count1>=count0 -> true -> so has1 becomes true.

        Now consider two tables: 
            Table1: "000", Table2: "000"
            Then total_ones=0 -> we don't check has1.

        Now consider: 
            Table1: "000", Table2: "111"
            Then we have has0=true and has1=true.

        Now consider: 
            Table1: "001", Table2: "110"
            Table1: count0=2, count1=1 -> we set to 0: has0=true, condition for dish1: count1>=count0? 1>=2 -> false -> so has1 remains false? Then Table2: count0=1, count1=2 -> set to 1: then condition: count1>=count0 -> true -> so has1 becomes true.

        Now the problematic case: 
            Table1: "0", Table2: "0"
            Then both tables are set to 0. Then has0=true for both? But for dish1: condition fails? Actually, we don't check because total_ones=0.

        Now if we have two tables: 
            Table1: "01", Table2: "00"
            Then Table1: count0=1, count1=1 -> we set to either? Then we set has0=true and has1=true? Then we don't force.

        Therefore, the only time we force is when:
            - There is at least one contestant that wants dish0, but no table was set to dish0 (by majority) -> then we force one table that was set to 1 to become 0 (which we stored in list_force0) and we take the minimal loss.
            - Similarly for dish1.

        However, note: what if we have a table that was set to 0, but we force it to 1? Actually, we don't: we are only forcing when we don't have a table set to the dish. We are forcing a table that was set to the other dish to become the dish we need.

        But note: we are allowed to change more than one table? Actually, we are only forced to have one table for dish0 and one for dish1? So we only need to force one table for dish0 (the minimal loss) and one for dish1? We don't force two tables for dish0? Because one is enough.

        However, what if we need both? Then we force two tables: one for 0 and one for 1? And we subtract both minimal losses? 

        Example: 
            n=2, two tables: 
                Table1: "0000" -> count0=4, count1=0 -> set to 0: saving=4, has0=true, has1=false? (because count1>=count0 -> 0>=4 -> false) -> but total_ones>0? Actually, from Table2 we will have ones? 
                Table2: "1111" -> count0=0, count1=4 -> set to 1: saving=4, has1=true? -> then we have both flags? So no force.

        Now consider:
            n=2, two tables: 
                Table1: "0001", Table2: "1110"

            Table1: count0=3, count1=1 -> set to 0: saving=3, has0=true, has1: condition? count1>=count0? 1>=3 -> false -> so has1 remains false? 
            Table2: count0=1, count1=3 -> set to 1: saving=3, then condition: count1>=count0 -> true -> so has1 becomes true.

            Then we have both flags? So no force.

        Now consider a case that requires forcing both? Actually, impossible? Because if we set each table to the majority, then if a table has at least one contestant, the majority dish is set and we have that dish. The only problem is if we have:
            - The entire set has dish0 and dish1, but we set every table to dish0? Then we don't have a table set to dish1? Actually, no: if we set every table to dish0, then we must have that for every table, the majority was dish0? Then we have dish0 set everywhere -> then we don't have a table set to dish1? Then we must force one table to dish1? But how? We have to force a table that was set to dish0 to become dish1? Then we lose (count0 - count1) for that table.

        How do we get that we set every table to dish0? That means every table had count0>=count1 -> then has0=true, and has1=false? Then if total_ones>0, we must force one table to dish1? But note: we have stored the loss for forcing a table to dish1? Actually, we stored for tables that had count1 < count0? Then we have list_force1 for every table? Then we take the minimal loss.

        Similarly, if we set every table to dish1, then we have has1=true and has0=false? Then if total_zeros>0, we force one table to dish0? And we have stored list_force0 for every table? Then take minimal loss.

        Therefore, we must store:
            For any table that has count0 < count1 -> we can force it to dish0? Then loss = count1 - count0 -> store in list_force0.
            For any table that has count1 < count0 -> we can force it to dish1? Then loss = count0 - count1 -> store in list_force1.

        But note: if a table has count0==count1, then we don't store in either? Then if we set such a table to dish0, we don't need to force for dish1? Actually, we have set it to dish0, so we have dish0, but we don't have dish1? Then we must force another table to dish1? But that table might be one that was set to dish0? Then we take the loss from that table? However, we did not store it in list_force1? 

        How do we handle tables with count0==count1?
            We set them arbitrarily? And we set both flags? Then we don't need to force? 

        Actually, in the condition: 
            if count0>=count1 -> then we set has0=true (and for such a table we set it to 0) and if count1>=count0 (which is true) then we set has1=true? So we set both flags? Then we don't need to force for either dish? 

        Therefore, we don't store these in the force lists? And we have both flags set? Then we don't subtract any loss.

        But what if we have:
            Table1: "01" (count0=1, count1=1) -> we set has0=true and has1=true -> then we don't force? 
            Table2: "00" -> set to 0 -> has0=true, has1 remains false? Actually, no: we set has0=true and for Table2: count1>=count0? 0>=2 -> false -> so has1 remains what? It was set to true by Table1? Then we have both flags? 

        Therefore, we don't need to force? 

        However, what if we have:
            Table1: "01", Table2: "00"
            Then after processing Table1: has0=true, has1=true.
            Then Table2: we set to 0 -> then condition: count1>=count0? 0>=2 -> false -> so we don't set has1 again? But we already set has1 from Table1? So we are okay.

        Therefore, the algorithm is:

            total = 0
            saving = 0
            has0 = false
            has1 = false
            total0 = 0, total1 = 0
            force0 = vector for losses when forcing a table to 0 (only for tables with count0 < count1)
            force1 = vector for losses when forcing a table to 1 (only for tables with count1 < count0)

            for each string s:
                L = len(s)
                total += L
                c0 = count of '0'
                c1 = L - c0
                total0 += c0
                total1 += c1

                saving += max(c0, c1)

                if c0 >= c1:
                    has0 = true
                if c1 >= c0:
                    has1 = true

                if c0 < c1:
                    force0.push_back(c1 - c0)
                else if c1 < c0:
                    force1.push_back(c0 - c1)

            if (total0 > 0 && !has0) {
                // we need to force one table to 0: choose the minimal loss from force0
                if (force0.empty()) {
                    // This should not happen: because if total0>0, then there is at least one '0' in the entire set, and if we set every table to 1, then every table had c0 < c1? Then force0 should not be empty? Actually, if there is a table that has c0>=c1 then we set has0=true -> so we wouldn't be here. Therefore, if we are here, force0 should be non-empty? But what if there are no tables that had c0 < c1? Then force0 is empty -> then it's a problem? Actually, if has0 is false, then every table had c0 < c1? Then we have force0 for every table? Then force0 is not empty? 
                }
                saving -= *min_element(force0.begin(), force0.end());
            }
            if (total1 > 0 && !has1) {
                if (force1.empty()) {
                    // same reasoning: force1 should not be empty?
                }
                saving -= *min_element(force1.begin(), force1.end());
            }

            moves = total - saving;
            output moves.

        However, note: the constraints say the total length of strings <= 500000, so we can use min_element for the vectors? The vectors force0 and force1 have at most n (100000) elements? So worst-case we might have 100000 elements? Then min_element is O(n) and we do at most two such min_element. Total O(n) which is acceptable.

        But note: we have to be cautious: n can be 100000, and the vectors force0 and force1 can have up to 100000 elements? Then two min_element operations: 200000 comparisons? That is acceptable.

        Let's test with sample input 1:

            n=4
            Strings: 
                "11101101" -> c0: count '0' -> 3? Actually: 
                    1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1 -> 0 at positions 4 and 7 -> so c0=2, c1=6 -> saving += 6
                    has0: 2>=6? false -> so not set? 
                    has1: 6>=2 -> true -> set has1=true.
                    force0: since 2<6, push 6-2=4.

                "00" -> c0=2, c1=0 -> saving +=2
                    has0: 2>=0 -> true -> set has0=true (so now has0=true)
                    has1: 0>=2 -> false -> but has1 is already true? So no problem.
                    force1: since 0<2 -> but condition: else if c1 < c0 -> 0<2 -> true -> push 2-0=2.

                "10001" -> c0: count '0' -> three zeros? Actually: '1','0','0','0','1' -> zeros:3 -> c0=3, c1=2 -> saving +=3
                    has0: 3>=2 -> true -> already set? 
                    has1: 2>=3 -> false -> but already true? 
                    force1: since c1=2 < c0=3 -> push 3-2=1.

                "10" -> c0=1, c1=1 -> saving +=1 (max=1) -> but note: actually max(1,1)=1? 
                    has0: 1>=1 -> true -> set has0 (already true) 
                    has1: 1>=1 -> true -> set has1 (already true)
                    no force.

            total_contestants = 8+2+5+2 = 17? 
            saving = 6+2+3+1 = 12
            total0 = 2+2+3+1 = 8? 
            total1 = 6+0+2+1 = 9? 

            Now: has0=true (from the second table) and has1=true (from the first table) -> no force.

            Then moves = 17 - 12 = 5 -> matches sample.

        Sample input 2:
            2
            "101010" -> c0=3, c1=3 -> saving=3, has0=true, has1=true -> no force? 
            "010101" -> c0=3, c1=3 -> saving=3, has0=true, has1=true -> no force? 
            total_contestants = 6+6=12
            saving=3+3=6
            moves=12-6=6 -> matches.

        But sample input 2 output is 6? Then it's correct.

        Sample input 3:
            5
            "0000" -> c0=4, c1=0 -> saving=4, has0=true, has1=false? (but total1? we'll see)
            "11" -> c0=0, c1=2 -> saving=2, has1=true
            "0" -> c0=1, c1=0 -> saving=1, has0=true
            "00000000" -> c0=8, c1=0 -> saving=8, has0=true
            "1" -> c0=0, c1=1 -> saving=1, has1=true

            total_contestants = 4+2+1+8+1 = 16
            saving = 4+2+1+8+1 = 16
            moves = 0 -> matches.

        But note: what if we have a table that is empty? Actually, the problem states: "each table" and there is at least one contestant initially at each table. So we don't have empty strings.

        Therefore, the code:

            Read n, then n lines.

        Implementation in C++: we have to be careful because the total length of the strings is at most 500000, but n can be up to 100000? Actually, the constraint: "The sum of |S_i| across all i does not exceed 500000". So we can read each string and process.

        Steps:

            #include <iostream>
            #include <vector>
            #include <algorithm>
            #include <cctype>
            #include <climits>
            #include <string>

            using namespace std;

            int main() {
                ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
                cin.tie(0);

                int n;
                cin >> n;
                cin.ignore();

                long long total_contestants = 0;
                long long saving = 0;
                long long total_zeros = 0, total_ones = 0;
                bool has0 = false;
                bool has1 = false;
                vector<int> force0;
                vector<int> force1;

                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                    string s;
                    cin >> s;
                    total_contestants += s.size();
                    int count0 = 0;
                    for (char c : s) {
                        if (c == '0') count0++;
                    }
                    int count1 = s.size() - count0;
                    total_zeros += count0;
                    total_ones += count1;

                    saving += max(count0, count1);

                    if (count0 >= count1) {
                        has0 = true;
                    }
                    if (count1 >= count0) {
                        has1 = true;
                    }

                    if (count0 < count1) {
                        force0.push_back(count1 - count0);
                    } else if (count1 < count0) {
                        force1.push_back(count0 - count1);
                    }
                }

                if (total_zeros > 0 && !has0) {
                    // We need to force one table to dish0: choose the minimal loss from force0
                    int min_force0 = *min_element(force0.begin(), force0.end());
                    saving -= min_force0;
                }
                if (total_ones > 0 && !has1) {
                    int min_force1 = *min_element(force1.begin(), force1.end());
                    saving -= min_force1;
                }

                long long moves = total_contestants - saving;
                cout << moves << endl;

                return 0;
            }

        Let me test with sample input 1: we got 5, which is correct.

        But what if we have a table that is all zeros? Then we set has0=true? Then we don't force? 

        However, what if we have:
            n=2, tables: ["000", "111"] -> 
                Table1: count0=3, count1=0 -> has0=true, has1=false? Actually: condition for dish1: count1>=count0? 0>=3 -> false -> so has1 remains false? 
                Table2: count0=0, count1=3 -> then condition for dish0: count0>=count1? 0>=3 -> false -> so has0 remains false? -> then we would force? But wait: after Table2 we set has1=true? 
                Then we have: 
                    has0=true (from Table1) and has1=true (from Table2) -> no force.

        Therefore, the flags are set by at least one table? Then we are safe.

        However, what if we have:
            n=3: 
                Table1: "000" -> sets has0=true
                Table2: "111" -> sets has1=true
                Table3: "01" -> sets both? 

        So the flags are set.

        But what if:
            n=2:
                Table1: "0" -> sets has0=true, and condition for dish1: fails -> has1 remains false? 
                Table2: "1" -> sets has1=true -> then we have both.

        Therefore, the code is correct.

        Let me run the sample input 1 again to be safe:

            Strings: 
                "11101101": count0=2, count1=6 -> saving=6; has0: 2>=6 -> false -> so not set; has1: 6>=2 -> true -> set has1=true; then force0: push 4.
                "00": count0=2, count1=0 -> saving=2; has0: 2>=0 -> true -> set has0=true; has1: 0>=2 -> false; then force1: push 2 (because 0<2 -> push 2-0=2).
                "10001": count0=3, count1=2 -> saving=3; has0: 3>=2 -> true; has1: 2>=3 -> false; force1: push 1 (because 2<3 -> push 3-2=1).
                "10": count0=1, count1=1 -> saving=1; has0: 1>=1 -> true; has1: 1>=1 -> true; no push.

            Then:
                total_contestants = 8+2+5+2 = 17
                saving = 6+2+3+1 = 12
                total_zeros = 2+2+3+1 = 8 -> so we check: has0 is true -> skip forcing for dish0.
                total_ones = 6+0+2+1 = 9 -> has1 is true -> skip forcing for dish1.

                moves = 17-12=5.

        Therefore, output 5.

        Now, what if we have a case that requires forcing? 

        Example: 
            n=2, tables: 
                Table1: "0001" -> count0=3, count1=1 -> set to 0: saving=3; has0=true; has1: 1>=3? false -> so has1 remains false? 
                Table2: "1110" -> count0=1, count1=3 -> set to 1: saving=3; has1=true -> so after both, has0=true and has1=true -> no force.

        Now, to get a force, we need to set every table to one dish? 

        Example: 
            n=2, tables:
                Table1: "0001" -> count0=3, count1=1 -> set to 0: saving=3; has0=true; has1: false -> but note: we set has1 only if for this table count1>=count0 -> false -> so has1 remains false? 
                Table2: "0011" -> count0=2, count1=2 -> set to either? Then condition: count0>=count1 -> true -> set has0=true; count1>=count0 -> true -> set has1=true -> so then we have has1=true.

        Now, to get no table set to dish1 by majority? We need every table to have count0 > count1? Then we set every table to 0 -> then has1 is never set? 

        Example: 
            n=2: 
                Table1: "0001" -> count0=3, count1=1 -> set to 0: has0=true, has1: false -> and force1: push (3-1)=2? Actually, condition: else if (count1 < count0) -> push force1: 3-1=2? 
                Table2: "001" -> count0=2, count1=1 -> set to 0: has0=true (already true), has1: false -> then push force1: 2-1=1.

            Then: total_ones = 1+1 = 2>0, and has1=false -> so we force one table to dish1: we choose the minimal loss from force1: min(2,1)=1 -> saving becomes 3+2 - 1 = 4? 
            total_contestants = 4+3=7 -> moves=7-4=3.

        How to verify? 
            We have two tables: 
                Table1: 3 zeros, 1 one -> if we set to 0: we leave 3, move 1 -> cost=1.
                Table2: 2 zeros, 1 one -> if we set to 0: we leave 2, move 1 -> cost=1.
                Total moves=2? But wait, we forced one table to 1? 

            What if we force the second table to 1? Then for the second table: we leave 1 one and move 2 zeros -> cost=2. Then we have:
                Table1: set to 0: cost=1 (move the one) -> total moves=1+2=3.

            Alternatively, we force the first table to 1: then first table: leave 1 one and move 3 zeros -> cost=3; second table: set to 0: cost=1 -> total moves=4? 

            But we chose the minimal loss: the loss for forcing the second table is 1 (because we originally saved 2 by setting to 0, and if we force to 1 we save 1, so we lose 1 saving -> so total saving becomes 3+2 -1=4 -> moves=7-4=3).

            And indeed, minimal moves is 3? 

            But is there a better way? 
                We could set both tables to 1? 
                    Table1: leave the 1 one and move 3 zeros -> cost=3.
                    Table2: leave the 1 one and move 2 zeros -> cost=2 -> total=5 -> worse.

                Or set Table1 to 0 and Table2 to 1? -> cost=1 (from Table1: move the one) + 1 (from Table2: move the one) -> wait, no: 
                    Table1: set to 0: we leave 3 zeros and move the one -> cost=1.
                    Table2: set to 1: we leave the one and move the 2 zeros -> cost=2 -> total=3? 
                But then we have two moves? Actually, we have to move the one in Table1 and the two zeros in Table2? That is 3 contestants? 

            Therefore, 3 is the minimal.

            How about: 
                We set Table1 to 0: cost=1 (move the one to Table2? Then Table2 becomes: "1" (from Table1) + "001" -> becomes "1001" -> which has two ones and two zeros? Then we set Table2 to 0? Then we have to move the two ones? cost=2 -> total=1+2=3.

                Alternatively, move the one from Table1 to Table2 and set Table2 to 1? Then Table2: "1" (from Table1) + "001" -> becomes "1001" -> then we set Table2 to 1: we leave the two ones and move the two zeros? cost=2 -> total=1 (from Table1) + 2 (from Table2)=3.

            So 3 is the minimal.

            Therefore, the algorithm produces 3.

        Therefore, the code is correct.

        Let me code accordingly.

        Important: the force vectors are vectors of int? The losses: the maximum loss for a table is at most 200000? So int is enough.

        However, saving and total_contestants can be up to 500000? So long long for these.

        We'll code accordingly.

        One more note: the condition for forcing: we subtract the loss from saving. But saving is the total of the majority per table. Then we subtract the loss (which is the reduction in saving when we force one table to the minority dish). Then we get the adjusted saving.

        Then moves = total_contestants - adjusted_saving.

        Now, let me write the code.

        Note: we must be cautious with the flags: we start with false and set to true if at least one table meets the condition.

        Code:

            #include <iostream>
            #include <vector>
            #include <algorithm>
            #include <cctype>
            #include <climits>
            #include <string>
            #include <cctype>
            using namespace std;

            int main() {
                ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
                cin.tie(0);
                int n;
                cin >> n;
                cin.ignore(); // not necessary if we use cin and then getline? But we are using cin>>string? 

                long long total_contestants = 0;
                long long saving = 0;
                long long total_zeros = 0, total_ones = 0;
                bool has0 = false;
                bool has1 = false;
                vector<int> force0;
                vector<int> force1;

                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                    string s;
                    cin >> s;
                    total_contestants += s.size();
                    int count0 = 0;
                    for (char c : s) {
                        if (c == '0') count0++;
                    }
                    int count1 = s.size() - count0;
                    total_zeros += count0;
                    total_ones += count1;

                    saving += max(count0, count1);

                    if (count0 >= count1) {
                        has0 = true;
                    }
                    if (count1 >= count0) {
                        has1 = true;
                    }

                    if (count0 < count1) {
                        force0.push_back(count1 - count0);
                    } else if (count1 < count0) {
                        force1.push_back(count0 - count1);
                    }
                }

                if (total_zeros > 0 && !has0) {
                    int min_force0 = *min_element(force0.begin(), force0.end());
                    saving -= min_force0;
                }
                if (total_ones > 0 && !has1) {
                    int min_force1 = *min_element(force1.begin(), force1.end());
                    saving -= min_force1;
                }

                long long moves = total_contestants - saving;
                cout << moves << '\n';

                return 0;
            }

        Let me run the sample that requires forcing:

            n=2: 
                Table1: "0001" -> count0=3, count1=1 -> saving=3; has0=true; has1=false? -> then push to force1: 3-1=2? Actually, condition: else if (count1 < count0) -> yes, so push 3-1=2 to force1.
                Table2: "001" -> count0=2, count1=1 -> saving=2; has0=true; has1=false -> then push to force1: 2-1=1.

                Then: total_zeros=3+2=5>0 -> has0=true -> skip force0.
                total_ones=1+1=2>0 -> has1=false -> so we do the second if: we subtract min_force1 = min(2,1)=1 -> saving = 3+2 -1 = 4.
                moves = (3+1+2+1) - 4? total_contestants=4+3=7 -> moves=7-4=3.

            Correct.

        Therefore, we output 3.

        But note: the problem states: "The destination table must be one of the n tables", and we are allowed to move contestants arbitrarily? And we are counting the moves.

        The algorithm is correct.

        We'll run the provided examples to be safe.

        Sample Input #2: 
            2
            101010
            010101

            total_contestants=6+6=12
            Table1: count0=3, count1=3 -> saving=3; has0=true, has1=true; no push to force.
            Table2: same -> saving=3; has0=true, has1=true.
            total saving=6, moves=12-6=6.

        Output 6.

        Sample Input #3: 
            5
            0000 -> saving=4; has0=true; push force1: 4-0=4? Actually: condition: else if (count1<count0) -> 0<4 -> true -> push 4? 
            11 -> saving=2; has1=true; push force0: 2-0=2? 
            0 -> saving=1; has0=true; push force1: 1-0=1?
            00000000 -> saving=8; push force1: 8? 
            1 -> saving=1; push force0: 1? 

            But note: the condition: 
                "0000": count0=4, count1=0 -> condition: count0>=count1 -> true -> set has0=true; and count1>=count0? false -> so we push to force1? 
            However, we don't need to force? Because we have has0 and has1 set? 

            total_zeros=4+0+1+8+0=13? 
            total_ones=0+2+0+0+1=3

            has0=true, has1=true -> no forcing.

            saving=4+2+1+8+1=16, moves=0.

        So we output 0.

        However, the force vectors are built even when we don't use them? That's acceptable.

        Therefore, the code is correct.

        We'll submit accordingly.

        Note: the constraints say the total length <= 500000, so the inner loop over each string is acceptable.

        Let me test with worst-case: 100000 tables, each string of length 5 -> total length 500000 -> 500000* (100000 iterations? no: the inner loop is over the length of the string -> so total 500000 iterations.

        Then the min_element operations: worst-case, force0 and force1 can have 100000 elements? Then two min_element: O(100000) each -> total 200000 comparisons? That is acceptable.

        Therefore, we code accordingly.
