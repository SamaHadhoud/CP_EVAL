 We are iterating b from 1 to n-1 (0-indexed: b from 1 to n-1, meaning the second student to the last)
 and for each b, we iterate a from b-1 down to 0 (to get the largest a for a fixed b, we go from high a to low a and break at the first valid pair for this b).

 However, note: the problem requires the smallest b and then the largest a. Our iteration:
   - We are iterating b from 0-indexed 1 to n-1 (which corresponds to student indices 2 to n in 1-indexed). 
     But note: we start b=1 (0-indexed) and then a from 0 to b-1? Actually, we are going a from b-1 down to 0 to find the largest a (in terms of index, the highest a) for the current b.

 Important: The problem says: 
   "If there is more than one pair, find the one with the smallest b. If there is still more than one pair, find the one with the largest a."

 How we do:
   - We iterate b from 0-indexed 1 to n-1 (which is the second student to the last). 
     This b is increasing: so we are starting from the smallest b (in 1-indexed: 2, then 3, then ...).
   - For a fixed b, we iterate a from b-1 down to 0: so we are checking a = b-1, b-2, ... 0. 
     The first valid a we find in this inner loop (which is the largest a in index? Actually, the largest a in value because a is decreasing from b-1 to 0) 
     but note: the index a=0 is the smallest index? However, we are looking for the largest a (meaning the highest student number). 
     Since a is the student index, and we are going from a = b-1 (which is the largest a index for this b) down to 0, the first valid a we find is the largest a (in terms of student number) for this b.

 Why? Because we start at a = b-1 (the highest possible a for this b) and then go downwards. The first valid we find is the highest a for this b.

 Therefore, we break the inner loop as soon as we find a valid pair (a, b) and output it and return.

 However, note: we are iterating b from smallest (0-indexed 1, then 2, ...). So the first time we find a pair for any b, that b is the smallest possible b, and for that b we have the largest a.

 This matches the requirement.

 But note: we must break and return immediately when we find the first pair? Because we are iterating from the smallest b and then from the largest a for that b. So the first pair we find is the answer.

 However, we must note: the problem says "smallest b" and then "largest a". Our search order ensures that.

 Steps:
   Precompute non_dot_positions: for each student i, we have a list of indices j where grid[i][j] != '.'

   Then:
     for b from 1 to n-1 (0-indexed, which is the second student to the last) 
        for a from b-1 down to 0
            Let da = |non_dot_positions[a]|, db = |non_dot_positions[b]|
            If both da and db are less than k, skip.

            Otherwise, we traverse the shorter list to count the matches.

            How: 
                We have two lists: L1 = non_dot_positions[a] and L2 = non_dot_positions[b]
                We want to count the positions j that are common in both (meaning j in L1 and also in L2) and for which grid[a][j] == grid[b][j]. 
                But note: if j is in L1, then grid[a][j] is non-dot, and if j is in L2, then grid[b][j] is non-dot. So we can check.

            However, we don't need to merge the lists. Instead, we can iterate on the shorter list and for each j in that list, check if the other student has a non-dot at j and if the characters match.

            We also do early termination: 
                If we have already found k, break.
                Also, if the current count plus the remaining positions in the list we are traversing is less than k, we break early.

            But note: the remaining positions might not be enough even if we have the entire list? We are only traversing the shorter list. However, the condition: 
                count + (remaining length) < k -> then break.

            Since we are traversing the shorter list, the maximum possible matches we can get from the rest is the remaining length. So if count + (remaining length) < k, we break.

            However, note: we are traversing the shorter list? Actually, we are taking the shorter list to minimize the work.

            Implementation:
                if da <= db:
                    for each j in non_dot_positions[a]:
                        if grid[b][j] != '.' and grid[a][j] == grid[b][j]:
                            count++
                            if count>=k: break
                        if (remaining = L - current_index - 1) and (count + remaining < k) -> break
                else: similarly for non_dot_positions[b]

            But note: the condition for the remaining: we are at index `idx` (0-indexed) in a list of length L. The remaining elements are L - idx - 1. So we break when:
                count + (L - idx - 1) < k

            However, we break only if we haven't reached k.

        If we found a pair (a, b) that has at least k matches, we output (a+1, b+1) and return.

   If we don't find any, output -1.

 Let's test with the sample input 1: 
     n=3, m=3, k=2, strings: ["BBC", "..C", ".BC"]

     Precompute non_dot_positions:
        student0: [0,1,2]   -> "BBC"
        student1: [2]        -> "..C"
        student2: [1,2]      -> ".BC"

     b=1 (0-indexed, which is the second student, index1) -> then a from 0 down to ... but a can only be 0? 
        Check a=0 and b=1:
          da = 3, db=1 -> we traverse the shorter list: non_dot_positions[b] (which is [2])
          j=2: grid[0][2] = 'C', grid[1][2]='C' -> match. count=1 -> which is <2? so we break the inner loop? 
          Then we don't have k=2. So we skip.

     Then b=2 (the third student, index2): 
        a=1: 
            da = 1, db=2 -> traverse non_dot_positions[a] = [2]
            j=2: grid[1][2]='C', grid[2][2]='C' -> match. count=1 -> not enough.
        a=0:
            da=3, db=2 -> traverse non_dot_positions[2] (the shorter one: length=2) -> positions [1,2]
            j=1: grid[0][1]='B', grid[2][1]='B' -> match -> count=1
            j=2: grid[0][2]='C', grid[2][2]='C' -> match -> count=2 -> we break and output (0+1, 2+1) -> 1 3.

     This matches sample output #1.

     Now sample input #2: k=1
        b=1: a=0 -> we traverse non_dot_positions[1] (shorter) which has only j=2 -> match -> count=1 >=1 -> output (0+1, 1+1) = "1 2"

     So it works.

     However, note: the condition for skipping if both da and db are less than k: 
        if (da < k && db < k) -> skip.

     But in the above example for k=1: 
        da=3 >=1, db=1>=1 -> we don't skip.

     Also for k=3: 
        We check the pairs:
          b=1: a=0 -> da=3, db=1 -> we traverse the shorter list (db=1) -> we get 1 match -> not enough (need 3). 
          Then we break because after the first element we have: count=1 and remaining = 0 -> 1+0 <3 -> break the inner loop? Actually, we break the inner loop for this a.

          Then b=2: 
             a=1: da=1, db=2 -> traverse the shorter list (a has da=1): 
                 j=2: match -> count=1 -> then remaining = 0 -> 1<3 -> break.
             a=0: da=3, db=2 -> traverse the shorter list (db=2): 
                 j=1: check: grid[0][1]='B', grid[2][1]='B' -> count=1
                 j=2: grid[0][2]='C', grid[2][2]='C' -> count=2 -> then we break because 2 + remaining (0) = 2 <3 -> so not found.

        Then output -1.

     This matches sample #3.

     So the code is as above.

     However, note: the condition for the remaining is at the end of the loop? Actually, we break after processing the current element? 
        We check at the end of the current iteration: if the current count plus the remaining elements (which are L - idx - 1) is less than k, then break.

        But note: we break the entire for-loop? Yes, because we are in the for-loop of the shorter list.

     But note: if we break the for-loop, we break the entire checking for this pair? And then we move to the next a? Yes.

     We don't want to break the entire inner a-loop? Actually, we break the inner for-loop that iterates the positions for the current pair (a,b). Then we check the next a? 
        Actually, the break is inside the for-loop that is iterating the positions. So after we break that for-loop, we then check the condition: if count>=k? 
        If not, we move to the next a.

     So the code is correct.

     But note: worst-case performance? 
        The worst-case is when we have to check all pairs and for each pair we traverse the entire shorter list (which can be up to 3000). 
        The total number of pairs is about n*(n-1)/2 = 5000*4999/2 ~ 12.5e6. And 12.5e6 * 3000 = 37.5e9 operations, which is too slow in C++ (even in 3 seconds).

     We must optimize: 
        The key is that k is at most 5. So we can break early when we have found k matches. 
        Also, we break when the remaining positions are not enough to get k. 

        But worst-case (when we have to traverse the entire list) happens when the two students share less than k matches and the shorter list is long? 

        However, we break when the remaining positions are not enough: 
            condition: count + (remaining) < k -> break.

        So after k elements that are not matches? Actually, we break if at any point the current count plus the remaining elements in the list is less than k.

        How does that help? 
            Suppose we are traversing a list of length L. We break when we have processed idx+1 elements and we have count, and the remaining is L - idx - 1.
            Then if count + (L - idx - 1) < k, we break.

        This condition might break early if we haven't found enough matches and the rest of the list is not enough.

        Example: k=5, and we are at the beginning: count=0, and we have 4 elements left -> 0+4<5 -> break. So we do 0 iterations? Actually, we break after the first element? 
            No, we break at the beginning? Actually, we check after processing each element? 

        We do: 
            for (int idx=0; idx < L; idx++) {
                ... process the element: if match then count++ and check if count>=k -> break.

                then: if (count + (L - idx - 1) < k) break;
            }

        But note: after the last element, we don't break? Actually, we break the loop naturally.

        How about: 
            at the start: idx=0, then after processing the first element, we check: count + (L-1) < k? 
            So if L < k, we break immediately? But we already skip if both are less than k? Actually, no: we skip only if both da and db are less than k. 
            But if one is >=k and the other is <k, we still check? 

        However, if the shorter list has length L and L < k, then we break at the condition: 
            After processing the first element: we have count (either 0 or 1) and then remaining = L-1 -> total count <= L < k -> so we break.

        Actually, we can break even earlier: we can break before the loop? 
            We have: the maximum number of matches we can get is min(da, db) but actually we don't know the exact without checking? 
            But note: the maximum matches we can get is the number of common positions? However, we don't know the common positions without checking.

        Alternatively, we can do: 
            if min(da, db) < k) then skip? 
            But note: we skip only if both are less than k? Actually, the problem condition: we skip if both are less than k? 
            But if one is >=k and the other is <k, then the maximum matches we can have is min(da, db) which is <k -> so we can skip.

        So we can change the condition to:
            if (min(da, db) < k) then skip.

        This will avoid the entire inner loop for the pair (a,b) if min(da, db) < k.

        Then we can write:

            if (min(da, db) < k) 
                continue;

        Then we traverse the shorter list? 

        How many pairs are we skipping? 
            Only pairs where min(da,db)>=k.

        How many such pairs? 
            Each student has a degree (number of non-dot) in [0, m]. 
            We don't know the distribution, but if many students have many non-dot answers, then min(da,db)>=k is common? 
            But k is at most 5, so min(da,db)>=k is true for any student with at least k non-dot answers? 

        The number of students with at least k non-dot answers: let this be N'. Then the pairs we check: about (N')^2? 
            Worst-case: all students have at least k non-dot answers -> then we check all pairs: n*(n-1)/2 = 12.5e6, which is acceptable? 
            But then for each pair we traverse the shorter list? which is at least k (but could be up to 3000). So worst-case 12.5e6 * 3000 = 37.5e9 operations, which is too slow.

        Therefore, we must rely on the early termination: 
            We break when we have found k matches (which is k=5, so we break at the 5th match) -> so we only do at most 5 * 12.5e6 = 62.5e6 operations? 

        But wait: we also break when the remaining positions are not enough? 
            condition: count + (remaining) < k -> then break.

            How often does that happen? 

        Actually, worst-case scenario: we break after k steps? But k is only 5. So we only need to check 5 elements per pair? 

        How? 
            We traverse the shorter list until we have found k matches, but we break early if we can't get k.

            However, we break at the k-th match. So we only need to check up to k elements? 

        Actually, no: we must check the entire list? But we break when we have k matches. And we also break when the remaining positions (plus current count) are less than k? 
            But if we have not found k matches, and the remaining positions are not enough, we break.

        How many elements do we check? 
            In the worst-case (where we don't break by k matches) we check at most min(L, L) = L? 

        But we can break when we know that even if we matched all the remaining, we wouldn't get k? 
            condition: count + (remaining) < k -> break.

            remaining = L - idx - 1 -> so we break when: 
                count + (L - idx - 1) < k

            This condition is checked after each element. 

            How many elements do we check until we break? 
                We break when: idx >= count + L - k? 

            Actually, we break at the first index idx such that: 
                count + (L - idx - 1) < k   =>   count + L - idx - 1 < k   =>   idx > L + count - k - 1.

            The worst-case is when we don't break until we have checked L elements? 

        But note: k is small (<=5) and the condition may break early? 

        However, worst-case: we have to check the entire list? 

        But we can also break by the condition: if we found k matches.

        So the worst-case for a pair is min(L, k + (L - k)? ) -> actually we break either by having k matches or by the condition that we can't get k. 
        And the condition that we can't get k might break earlier? 

        Actually, we break if at any point: 
            count + (L - idx - 1) < k.

        But if we haven't broken by k matches, then count < k. 
        The condition: count + (L - idx - 1) < k   =>   L - idx - 1 < k - count.

        Since k - count is at least 1 (if we haven't reached k), then we break when L - idx - 1 < k - count.

        How many elements do we traverse? 
            We traverse until we have at least k matches or until we break by the condition.

        The worst-case without breaking by k matches: we break when we have traversed at least L - (k - count - 1) elements? 
            Actually, we break when the remaining elements are less than (k - count). 
            So we traverse at most L - (k - count) + 1? 

        Actually, we break at the first element where the condition holds. 

        Alternatively, we can note that we break when: 
            idx >= L - (k - count - 1)   ??? 

        Actually, the condition: 
            count + (L - idx - 1) < k   =>   L - idx - 1 < k - count   =>   idx > L - (k - count) - 1.

        So the break happens when idx becomes at least L - (k - count) (ceiling). 

        Since we start at idx=0, we break at idx = max(0, L - (k - count))? 

        But note: if L - (k - count) < 0 then the condition is already true at the first element? 

        Actually, if L < k - count, then at the first element we break? 

        Therefore, the maximum number of elements we traverse for a pair is min(L, k) because:
            - We break when we have k matches -> at most k elements.
            - Or we break when we have traversed L - (k - count) elements? 
            But note: if we break by the condition, we break when we have traversed at most L - (k - count) + 1? 

        Actually, we traverse at most L? 

        However, note: k is at most 5. So we can break by the condition only if we haven't found k matches and we have less than k - count remaining. 
        But worst-case we traverse the entire list? 

        But wait: if we break by the condition, we break as soon as the remaining elements are less than the needed (k-count). 
        So we traverse at most L - (k - count) + 1? Actually, we traverse until we have idx such that the remaining is less than k-count. 

        But note: k-count is at most k (<=5). So we break when the remaining elements are less than 5? 
            Then we traverse at most L - (k - count) + 1? 

        Actually, we traverse at least the entire list? 

        However, we have an alternative: we can break when we have found k matches -> then we break at k (which is at most 5). 

        So the worst-case for a pair is 5? 

        Therefore, the inner loop for a pair (a,b) is O(min(L, k)) = O(5) = constant. 

        Then the total operations: 
            Number of pairs we check: 
                Only pairs (a,b) such that min(da,db)>=k. 
                How many such pairs? 
                    Let N' = number of students with at least k non-dot answers. 
                    Then the pairs we check: N' * (N')? Actually, for each b, we check all a in [0, b-1] that have at least k non-dot? 
                    But we skip pairs where min(da,db) < k? 
                    Actually, we skip only if min(da,db) < k. 

            The total number of pairs we check: 
                For each student b, the number of a (a from 0 to b-1) such that min(da, db) >= k.

            Worst-case: all students have at least k non-dot answers -> then we check all pairs: n*(n-1)/2 = 12.5e6.

            Then total operations: 12.5e6 * 5 = 62.5e6, which is acceptable in C++ (in 3 seconds).

        So we can change the condition to:

            if (min(da, db) < k) 
                continue;

            else 
                traverse the shorter list until we have k matches or break by the condition.

        But note: we are already storing the entire non_dot_positions list? And we are going to traverse the shorter list? 

        How to traverse the shorter list? We don't want to copy the list? We can use pointers to the two lists? 

        Actually, we can do:

            if (non_dot_positions[a].size() <= non_dot_positions[b].size()) {
                L = non_dot_positions[a].size();
                for (int idx=0; idx < L; idx++) {
                    j = non_dot_positions[a][idx];
                    if (grid[b][j] != '.' && grid[a][j] == grid[b][j]) {
                        count++;
                        if (count>=k) break;
                    }
                    if (count + (L - idx - 1) < k) break;
                }
            } else {
                ... similarly for non_dot_positions[b]
            }

        However, note: we are breaking when we have found k matches, and the condition for the remaining is only to break early when we know we can't get k.

        But with k<=5, we can also break when we have found k matches? 

        We can also note: if we break by the condition, we break early? 

        Actually, the condition for the remaining is not necessary? Because we are going to break at k matches? 
        But without the condition, worst-case we traverse the entire shorter list? 
            For a pair: we break at k matches -> at most k steps. 
            But if we don't find k matches, we traverse the entire list? 

        However, k is small, but the list could be long (up to 3000). 
        We want to avoid traversing 3000 elements for a pair? 

        We can break when we have found k matches, but if we don't, we still have to traverse the entire list? 

        But we can break if the remaining elements are not enough? 

        So the condition for the remaining is important to avoid long lists? 

        How about: 
            We break when we have found k matches? 
            And we break when we have checked so many that even if the rest were matches we couldn't get k? 

        The condition: 
            if (count + (L - idx - 1) < k) -> break.

        Without this condition, worst-case for a pair that doesn't have k matches: we traverse the entire shorter list (which can be 3000). 
        Then the total operations: 12.5e6 * 3000 = 37.5e9 -> too slow.

        With the condition: 
            We break when we know we can't get k? 
            How many steps? 
                We break when: idx >= L - (k - count) 
                Since k - count is at least 1, we break at idx = L - (k - count) which is at least L - k. 
                So we traverse at most L - (k - count) + 1? 

            Actually, we break at the first element where the condition holds? 

            But worst-case: we break at the beginning? 
                At idx=0: count=0, then condition: 0 + (L-1) < k -> if L-1 < k, then we break. 
                Then we traverse 0 elements? 

            But if L is large, say 3000, and k=5, then at idx=0: condition: 0 + 2999 < 5 -> false -> we don't break.
                Then we continue until we have found k matches? or until the condition holds?

            The condition holds when: 
                count + (L - idx - 1) < k.

            How many steps? 
                We break when: L - idx - 1 < k - count.

            Since k - count is at most k (<=5), then we break when L - idx - 1 < 5, i.e., when idx > L-6.

            So we break when we have at least L-5 elements left? 
            Actually, we break at idx = L - (k - count) -> but note: count might change as we go.

            Worst-case: we get no matches until the last few. 
                Then we break at idx = L - (k - count) -> but if count is 0, we break at idx = L - k? 

            Actually, we break at the element where idx = L - (k - count) - 1? 

            Let me try: 
                condition: count + (L - idx - 1) < k -> break.

                Rearranged: idx > L - (k - count) - 1.

            So we break at the first index that is greater than L - (k - count) - 1.

            How many elements do we traverse? 
                We traverse until idx = L - (k - count) (because then we break at the end of that iteration) -> but note: we break after processing the element at that index? 

            Actually, we break at the next element? 

            Example: k=5, L=3000, count=0:
                condition at idx=0: 0 + 2999 < 5 -> false -> next.
                ... until idx = 2995: 
                    condition: at the end of idx=2995: 
                        count (still 0) + (3000 - 2995 - 1) = 0 + (4) = 4 <5 -> true -> break.

                So we traverse 2996 elements? 

            That is too many.

        Therefore, we need a better way: 

        We can break when the number of elements remaining (including the current) is less than the required (k - count) to get to k? 
            Actually, we break when the remaining (from current to the end) is less than (k - count). 
            But we can break at the beginning of the iteration? 

        Alternatively, we can check at the beginning of the loop: 
            if (count + (L - idx) < k) break;

        Then we break without processing the current element? 

        How? 
            for (int idx=0; idx < L; idx++) {
                if (count + (L - idx) < k) break;

                ... process ...

            }

        Then at idx=2995 (in the example above): 
            condition: count + (3000-2995) = 0+5 = 5 -> not break -> then we process the element at idx=2995 -> no match -> count remains 0.
            Then at the end of the element: we check the condition for the next iteration? 
                Actually, we break at the beginning of the next iteration? 

            But then we do 2995+1 = 2996 iterations? 

        Alternatively, we can break at the beginning of the loop: 
            for (int idx=0; idx < L; idx++) {
                if (count + (L - idx) < k) break;   // because we haven't processed the current and the rest

                ... process ...

            }

        Then at idx=2995: condition: 0 + (3000-2995) = 5 >=5 -> we process the element -> no match -> count=0.
            Then at the next iteration: idx=2996 -> condition: 0 + (3000-2996) = 4 <5 -> break.

            Then we processed 2996 elements? 

        How to avoid processing so many? 

        We note: we are only interested in getting k matches. We don't care about the exact count beyond k. 
        And k is at most 5. So we can break when we have processed so many that even if we matched every remaining element we couldn't get k? 

        But we break at the beginning: 
            condition: if (count + (L - idx) < k) break;

        Then we avoid processing the current element? 

        Then the worst-case: we break at idx = L - (k - count) [if count is 0, then at idx = L - k] -> so we avoid processing the last (k - count) elements? 

        Actually, we break at the beginning of the iteration for idx = L - (k - count) to L-1? 

        Then we process: 
            from idx=0 to idx = L - (k - count) - 1 -> total of L - (k - count) elements.

        In the worst-case: L=3000, k=5, count=0 -> we process 3000-5 = 2995 elements? 

        That is still too many: 2995 per pair -> 12.5e6 * 2995 ~ 37.5e9 -> too slow.

        Therefore, we must avoid processing the entire list when we don't have k matches? 

        How? 

        Alternate idea: we only care about k matches. We can iterate until we have found k matches, and we break if we have already found k. 
        But if we don't have k matches, we don't care about the exact count? 

        However, we must break early if we cannot get k matches? 

        But note: we cannot know without traversing the entire list? 

        Actually, we don't know the future? 

        Therefore, we need to break when the number of remaining elements is less than k - count. 
        But we are already breaking at the beginning of the iteration? 

        The problem is that we are processing one element at a time. 

        However, we can precompute for each student the set of non-dot positions? But we are not storing the entire grid? 

        Another idea: we can precompute for each question? But then we are storing per question and per student? 

        Alternatively, we can use bitsets? But m=3000, n=5000 -> 5000*3000 bits = 15e6 bits = 1.875e6 bytes -> about 2MB per bitset? Then we have 5000 bitsets -> 10GB -> too much.

        Therefore, we must rely on the fact that k is small? 

        How about: we break when we have found k matches? 
            Then we break at k steps -> which is 5 per pair -> then total operations: 12.5e6 * 5 = 62.5e6 -> acceptable.

        But what if we don't break by k matches? Then we do min(da,db) steps? which can be 3000 per pair -> 12.5e6 * 3000 = 37.5e9 -> too slow.

        So we need to avoid that.

        Therefore, we must skip pairs that cannot have k matches without iterating the entire list? 

        How? 

        We note: the maximum possible matches for the pair is the number of common positions where both students answered? 
            But we don't know that without iterating? 

        Actually, we can precompute the common positions? 

        But that would be O(da+db) per pair? which is the same as what we are doing.

        Alternate approach: 
            Precompute an array for each student: the set of non-dot positions is stored as a bitset? Then we can do:

                common = bitset<3000>(student_a) & bitset<3000>(student_b);
                if (common.count() < k) skip.

            Then we don't need to iterate? 

        But we are storing bitsets for each student? 
            n=5000, m=3000 -> 5000 * (3000/8) = 5000 * 375 = 1.875e6 * 5000 = 9.375e6 bytes? about 9.4 MB? 

        Then for each pair: we do an AND of two bitsets and then count the number of ones? 
            The AND: O(m/word_size) -> m=3000 -> 3000/64 = 47 operations? 
            Then counting: O(m) in the worst-case? But we can use popcount? Then it's O(1) per word? 

        Actually, bitset::count() is O(m) in the worst-case? Or O(m/word_size) if implemented with popcount? 

        In C++ bitset count() is typically implemented with popcount per word? So O(m/word_size) which is about 47 per pair? 

        Then total operations: 12.5e6 * 47 = 587.5e6 -> acceptable? 

        But note: 587.5e6 operations -> each operation is a popcount? Actually, the AND is 47 operations (each word) and the popcount is also 47? 
            So total 94 operations per pair? Then 12.5e6 * 94 = 1175e6 -> 1.175e9 operations? 

        In C++ on a modern machine, 1e9 operations per second? So 1.175 seconds? But worst-case 12.5e6 pairs? 

        However, we skip pairs where min(da,db) < k? 
            Actually, we are going to do the bitset AND for every pair that we would have checked? 

        How many pairs? 
            Only pairs (a,b) such that min(da,db)>=k. 
            Worst-case: all students have at least k non-dot answers -> then we check all pairs: 12.5e6.

        Then 12.5e6 * 94 = 1175e6 -> 1.175e9 operations -> which is acceptable in 3 seconds? 

        But note: the problem says m up to 3000 -> we use bitset<3000>. 
            How to store 5000 bitsets? 
                Each bitset<3000> uses 3000/8 = 375 bytes? 
                5000 * 375 = 1.875e6 bytes? about 1.9 MB -> acceptable.

        Steps for bitset approach:

            Precompute:
                vector<bitset<3000>> student_bits(n);
                for each student i, for j from 0 to m-1:
                    if grid[i][j] != '.', set student_bits[i][j]=1; else 0.

            Then, also we need to check that the character is the same? 
                But note: the common positions are not enough: we need the character to be the same? 

            So we cannot just use the common positions in the bitset? 

            We stored the bitset only for non-dot? Then the common positions are the positions j such that both students answered (non-dot). 
            But then we need to check the character? 

            So we do:
                bitset<3000> common = student_bits[a] & student_bits[b];
                if (common.count() < k) -> skip.

                Then, we need to check the common positions to see if the characters match? 
                And we break as soon as we have k matches? 

            How to iterate the common positions? 
                We can iterate the bitset? which is O(m). 

            Then worst-case: we do 3000 per pair? and 12.5e6 * 3000 = 37.5e9 -> too slow.

        How about: we don't skip by the common.count()? 
            We only do common.count() to skip if the number of common positions is <k -> then skip.
            Otherwise, we have to check the common positions? 

            But then worst-case: if the common.count() is large, we iterate over the common positions? 

            We can break early: 
                for (int j=0; j<m; j++) {
                    if (common[j]) {
                        if (grid[a][j]==grid[b][j]) {
                            count++;
                            if (count>=k) break;
                        }
                    }
                }

            Then worst-case per pair: min(common.count(), k) -> which is at most k? 

            So total per pair: common.count() is done in O(m/word_size) and then the iteration for the common positions we break at k? 

            But how to iterate the common positions without iterating over all m? 
                We can precompute the list of non-dot positions? Then we already have non_dot_positions[a] and non_dot_positions[b]? 

            But we want the common positions? 

            We can do: 
                if (common.count() < k) skip.

                Then, we iterate the shorter list of non_dot_positions? 
                    and for each j in the shorter list, if common[j] is true (which means j is in the common positions) and then check the character? 
                    but then we break when we have k matches.

            But note: we have the list non_dot_positions[a] (for student a) and we know that if j is in non_dot_positions[a] and common[j] is true, then j is in non_dot_positions[b] as well? 
                Actually, common[j] = student_bits[a][j] & student_bits[b][j] -> so true only if both are non-dot.

            Then we can do:

                if (non_dot_positions[a].size() < non_dot_positions[b].size()) {
                    for (int idx=0; idx<non_dot_positions[a].size(); idx++) {
                        j = non_dot_positions[a][idx];
                        if (common[j]) {   // which means j is in both
                            if (grid[a][j]==grid[b][j]) {
                                count++;
                                if (count>=k) break;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                } else {
                    ... 
                }

            But the condition "common[j]" is a single bit check? 

            However, we already did common = student_bits[a] & student_bits[b]? 
                Then common[j] is a bit.

            How to check common[j] quickly? 
                We can store the bitset and then do: common[j] is O(1) to check.

            Then the inner loop: we iterate the shorter list and for each j we check common[j]? 
                If common[j] is false, we skip.

            How many iterations? the entire shorter list? which is up to 3000? 

            But we break when we have found k matches? 

            However, worst-case: we might have to iterate the entire list if we don't find k matches? 

            But we skip if common.count() < k -> then we know there are at least k common positions? 
                But we don't know if the characters match? 

            So we might still iterate the entire list? 

            And 12.5e6 * 3000 = 37.5e9 -> too slow.

        Therefore, we must avoid iterating the entire list? 

        We can break early: 
            condition: count + (common.count() - processed) < k -> break? 
            But we don't know common.count() for the entire common set? 

        Alternatively, we can break by the condition: 
            if (count + (min(da, db) - idx) < k) break;   -> but that is not correct: because not every common position has matching characters.

        We are stuck.

        Let me summarize:

        Option 1: 
            Without bitset: 
                We skip if min(da,db) < k.
                Then we iterate the shorter list and:
                    for each j in the list:
                        if the other student has non-dot at j and the characters match, count++.
                        if count>=k: break and output.
                    and we break if count + (remaining in the list) < k.

                The worst-case for a pair: we iterate the entire list? 
                Total: 12.5e6 * 3000 = 37.5e9 -> too slow.

        Option 2: 
            With bitset for common positions and then skip if common.count()<k, then iterate the shorter list to count the matching characters? 
            Then worst-case: we iterate the entire shorter list (3000) per pair -> 37.5e9 -> too slow.

        We need a solution that for a pair does at most O(k) work.

        Idea: 
            Precompute for each student the list of non-dot positions and also store the character at that position.

            For each pair (a,b) that has min(da,db)>=k:
                We want to know: are there at least k positions j such that:
                    j in non_dot_positions[a] and j in non_dot_positions[b] and grid[a][j]==grid[b][j]

                We can iterate on the shorter list and for each j in the list, check if j is in the non_dot_positions of the other student and if the characters match? 
                    But checking if j is in non_dot_positions[b]? We can create a boolean array for student b: present_b[j] = true if j in non_dot_positions[b]? 
                    And also we have the character? 

                But then we can do:
                    Create for each student a vector<bool> present (size m) and also the grid is stored.

                But then for each pair, we iterate the shorter list and for each j in the shorter list:
                    if (present_b[j] && grid[a][j]==grid[b][j]) then count++ and break if count>=k.

                And also break if count + (remaining) < k? 

                The remaining: the number of elements left in the shorter list. 
                But this is not the number of common positions with matching characters? 

                Actually, the condition: count + (remaining) < k -> is not valid because not every remaining j will be in the other student or match.

                We break at the same as before.

                This is the same as option 1.

        How to do in O(k)? 

        Idea: 
            We want to know if there are at least k matching common positions. 
            We can stop as soon as we find k.

            But how to find k quickly? 

            We can iterate the shorter list and hope to find k quickly. 
            Worst-case we might have to iterate the entire list? 

        But worst-case overall is 12.5e6 * 3000 = 37.5e9 -> too slow.

        We must reduce the number of pairs we check.

        How to reduce the number of pairs? 

        We note: k is at most 5. 
        We are currently checking every pair (a,b) with min(da,db)>=k.

        Alternate approach: 
            For each student b, we want to find a student a (a<b) such that the number of matching common positions >=k.
            And we want the smallest b and then the largest a.

            We can try: 
                for b from 1 to n-1 (0-indexed)
                and then for a from b-1 down to 0:

            But can we avoid checking every a? 

        Insight: 
            If we can quickly find the student a with the largest index (among a<b) that has at least k matching common positions with b, then we can break the a loop as soon as we find one.

            But we still have to check a from b-1 down to 0 until we find one? 

        However, we want the largest a for the current b? So we start at a=b-1 and go down to 0 and the first one we find is the largest a.

        So we cannot skip any a? 

        Therefore, we must check all a from b-1 down to 0 for which min(da,db)>=k.

        But the number of a for which min(da,db)>=k might be large.

        Final hope: 
            In practice, the early termination by count>=k will happen very fast because k is only 5. 
            And the condition count + (L - idx - 1) < k might also prune if the list is long and we haven't found any match in the beginning. 
            But worst-case (adversarial) might be when the matches are at the end of the list? 

        However, note: the list of non_dot_positions is stored in increasing order of j. 
        The adversarial might put the matching positions at the end. 

        Then we would and/or the entire list. 

        But 12.5e6 * 3000 = 37.5e9 operations might be borderline in C++ in 3 seconds? 
            In C++ in worst-case, 37.5e9 operations might be 37.5 seconds (assuming 1e9 per second). 

        Therefore, we must hope that the average-case is good, or find a more efficient solution.

        More efficient solution: 

        We can precompute for each question j, and for each character c, the list of students that have c at j. 
        Then for a fixed student b, we want to find a student a (a<b) such that there are at least k positions j where 
            both a and b answered j, and grid[a][j]==grid[b][j].

        How to do that for student b? 
            Let's consider the set of positions j that student b answered: non_dot_positions[b].
            For each such j, let c = grid[b][j]. 
            Then the potential students a that match with b on question j are the students a (a<b) that have grid[a][j]==c.

            We want to find a student a (a<b) that appears in at least k of these sets (for the positions j in non_dot_positions[b]).

            We can do: 
                Create an array count_a for a in [0, b-1] (init 0).
                For each j in non_dot_positions[b]:
                    c = grid[b][j]
                    For each student a in the list (for question j, character c) that is < b:
                         count_a[a]++
                         if count_a[a] >= k, then student a is valid.

                Then we want the largest a (index) that is valid.

            But note: we are iterating b from 0 to n-1, and within b we iterate over non_dot_positions[b] (size db), and for each j we iterate over the list of students that answered j with c. 

            The worst-case: if a question j is answered by many students with the same character, and db is large, then it might be slow.

            Total work: sum_{b} [ sum_{j in non_dot_positions[b]} (number of students a < b that have grid[a][j]==grid[b][j]) ]

            This could be O(n * m * n) = 5000 * 3000 * 5000 = 75e9 -> too slow.

        We can try to speed up with a sparse representation and breaking when count_a[a] reaches k? 
            But we have to increment count_a for each a in the list.

        Alternatively, we can stop as soon as we find an a that reaches count_a[a]>=k? 
            But we want the largest a (index) that reaches k. 

            However, if we are incrementing in arbitrary order, we might not know the largest a until the end.

        We can do: 
            for each b from 0 to n-1:
                create an array count for a in [0, b-1] (initialized to 0)
                for each j in non_dot_positions[b]:
                    c = grid[b][j]
                    for each a in the list L[j][c] (which are students that have answered j with c) and a < b:
                        count[a]++
                        if (count[a] >= k) {
                            candidate = a;   // but we want the largest a, so we continue to see if a larger a appears?
                        }
                then after processing all j, we find the largest a such that count[a]>=k.

            But note: we want the largest a (index) for which count[a]>=k. 
            So we can do: 
                after the inner loop, we scan a from b-1 downto 0 and take the first a with count[a]>=k.

            Then total work: sum_{b} [ db * (average number of students a in the list L[j][c]) ]

            The average number of students a in the list might be O(n) in the worst-case. 
            Then total work: sum_{b} [ db * n ] = n * (sum_{b} db) = n * (total non-dot answers) 

            total non-dot answers: at most n * m = 5000 * 3000 = 15e6.
            then total work: 5000 * 15e6 = 75e9 -> too slow.

        Given the complexity, we might have to rely on the first method with pruning and hope that in practice we terminate early.

        But the first method might be acceptable if we and/or the lists in the order of the student's non-dot positions and if the matches are found early.

        Since k is only up to 5, and we break as soon as we find 5 matches, and the lists are stored in increasing order of j, 
        we hope that the matching positions are evenly distributed and we find the matches within the first few elements.

        If not, we might break by the condition: 
            if (count + (L - idx - 1) < k) break;

        which in the worst-case (when there are no matches) will break after 5 steps? 
            Because after 5 steps: count=0, then if L - idx - 1 < k - count = 5, we break. 
            That is, if L - idx - 1 < 5, then we break. 
            But after 5 steps, we have idx=4, then L - 4 - 1 = L-5. 
            We break if L-5 < 5 -> i.e., if L<10. 
            If L>=10, we don't break after 5 steps? 

        We can change the condition to: 
            if (count + (L - idx) < k) break;   // before processing the current element

        then before we even process the current element, we know that even if we matched every remaining element, we wouldn't have k, so we break.

        Then at each step, we do:

            if (count + (L - idx) < k) break;   // before the current element

        then we process the element.

        then if (count>=k) break;

        So for a adversarial example with no matches and L=3000, we break at the first element? 
            At idx=0: count + (3000-0) = 0+3000 = 3000>=5, so we process.
            then no match -> count=0.
            then next: idx=1: count + (3000-1) = 3000-1 = 2999>=5 -> process.
            ... until when? 
            until count + (L - idx) < k -> 0 + (3000 - idx) < 5 -> when 3000 - idx < 5 -> idx > 3000-5 -> idx>=2995.

            So we process 2995 elements? 

        That is 2995 per pair -> 12.5e6 * 2995 = 37.5e9 -> too slow.

        Therefore, we must not iterate the entire list.

        Final idea: 
            For each student, store the list of non-dot positions, and also for each non-dot position, store the character.

            Then for a pair (a,b), we want to find the number of positions j in the intersection of non_dot_positions[a] and non_dot_positions[b] for which grid[a][j]==grid[b][j]. 
            This is the same as: 
                for each j in non_dot_positions[a]: 
                    if j is in non_dot_positions[b] and grid[a][j]==grid[b][j] then count++

            But we can create for student b a lookup table for its non-dot positions: 
                create an array of booleans for positions: present_b[0..m-1] = false initially.
                for each j in non_dot_positions[b]: 
                    present_b[j] = true;
                    and also store the character in an array: char_b[j] = grid[b][j]

            Then for student a, iterate its non_dot_positions[a]: for each j in non_dot_positions[a]:
                if (present_b[j] && grid[a][j] == char_b[j]) then count++

            And we break when count>=k.

            The work for a pair (a,b) is O(|non_dot_positions[a]|). 
            We can choose to iterate the shorter of non_dot_positions[a] and non_dot_positions[b]? 
                Actually, we are iterating non_dot_positions[a]. 
                But we can iterate the shorter one: 
                    if (non_dot_positions[a].size() < non_dot_positions[b].size()) 
                        iterate non_dot_positions[a]
                    else
                        iterate non_dot_positions[b] and swap the roles.

            Then work per pair: O(min(da, db)).

            In the worst-case, min(da,db) = 3000, and 12.5e6 * 3000 = 37.5e9 -> too slow.

        Given the time constraints, and that the intended solution might be the one with pruning on k (break at k matches) and the condition on the remaining elements, 
        and also skip if min(da,db) < k, and hope that in practice either the lists are short or we find k matches quickly, we output the first solution.

        But the sample input with 4 12 2 might have students with lists of length 9, 9, 9, 12? 
            Then 4 students: pairs: 6 pairs, each with min(da,db)=9, then we might have to do 9 per pair -> 6*9 = 54, which is fine.

        But adversarial: n=5000, and each student has 3000 non-dot answers, and we are the first student has to be matched with the next 4999 students, 
            then the first student (index0) and student1: work = 3000.
            student0 and student2: work = 3000.
            ... student0 and student4999: work=3000.
            then student1 and student2: work=3000.
            ...

            total work = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} sum_{j=i+1}^{n-1} min(d_i, d_j) = about (n choose 2) * 3000 = 12.5e6 * 3000 = 37.5e9.

        37.5e9 might be borderline in C++ with optimizations? 
            In C++ with Ofast, might do 1e9 operations per second, so 37.5 seconds.

        The time limit is 3 seconds.

        Therefore, we must try to break early. 
        With k=5, we can break the min(da,db) loop after at most 5 + (min(da,db) - (k - count)) steps? 
            but only if we have count<k, and then the condition on the remaining might not help until the end.

        But note: we break when count>=k, and k=5, so we break at the 5th match. 
        In the best-case, the first 5 non-dot positions of the shorter list might be in the present_b and match -> 5 steps.

        In the worst-case (no match or match at the end), we might have to do min(da,db) steps.

        Therefore, the solution might be too slow for adversarial inputs.

        We need a different approach.

        Let's try to use hashing to quickly compute the number of matching common positions? 
            Not obvious.

        Another idea: 
            For each student, for each of their non-dot positions j, we want to record: (j, c) where c = grid[i][j].

            For a pair (a,b), the number of matching common positions is the number of j in the intersection of non_dot_positions[a] and non_dot_positions[b] for which c_a = c_b.

            This is not the intersection of two sets of j, but also with condition on c.

        We might: 
            for student b, build a set: the set of (j, c) for each non-dot position j, with c = grid[b][j].

            then for student a: for each (j, c_a) in student a, 
                if (j, c_a) is in student b's set, then count++

            Then we break when count>=k.

            How to build the set for student b? 
                We can use a bitset? not for (j,c).

            Instead, we can use a boolean array for each student b: of size m * 26? 
                for each j in [0, m-1] and each c in [0,25], we store if student b has (j, c) -> but that is m*26=3000*26=78000 per student.
                5000 * 78000 = 390e6 booleans = 390e6/8 = 48.75e6 bytes = 48.75 MB -> acceptable.

            Then for student a, we iteration over its non_dot_positions[a]: 
                for each j in non_dot_positions[a]:
                    c = grid[a][j] - 'A';
                    if (has_b[j][c] for student b) then count++

            Work per pair: O(|non_dot_positions[a]|) = O(da).

            Then total work: sum_{ pairs } min(da, db) [because we can choose to iterate the shorter list] 
                = 37.5e9 in worst-case -> too slow.

        Given the complexity, and that the competition problem might have intended the first method with pruning on k and hope for the best, 
        and that k is only up to 5, and in practice the matching might be found in 5 steps, we will output the first method with the following optimizations:

            - Skip the pair if min(da, db) < k.
            - Iterate the shorter list.
            - For each element in the list, do:
                  if the other student has the same character at j, then count++ and if count>=k, break.
            - Also, before each element, we break if count + (remaining elements in the list) < k.

        But note: the condition before the element might be placed at the beginning of the loop:

            for (int idx=0; idx < L; idx++) {
                if (count + (L - idx) < k) break;   // cannot get k even if we match all the rest

                j = list[idx];
                if (grid[ other ][j] != '.' && grid[a][j] == grid[b][j]) {
                    count++;
                    if (count>=k) break;
                }
            }

        This is to avoid processing the element if we know we can't get k even if we matched all the rest.

        This condition is  .

        We hope that in many pairs, the list is long and we have no matches in the beginning, then the condition will break early.

        For example, if after 0 elements, count=0, then if L - 0 < k, we break. -> so if the shorter list has length <k, we break immediately. 
        But we already skip if min(da,db)<k, so L>=k initially. 
        Then at idx=0: count=0, then we require: 0 + (L-0) = L >=k, so we process.

        then at idx=1: count might be 0 or 1, then condition: count + (L-1) >=k? 

        Only when count + (L - idx) < k, we break.

        In the worst-case (no matches), we break when 
            count + (L - idx) < k  => 0 + (L - idx) < k  => L - idx < k.
            idx > L - k.

        So we break when idx = L - k + 1? 

        Then we will have processed (L - k) elements.

        Total work: (L - k) per pair.

        In the worst-case: L=3000, k=5, then 2995 per pair.

        Total work: 12.5e6 * 2995 = 37.5e9.

        This is 37.5e9 comparisons (each j we are doing a few conditionals and accesses).

        In C++ on a fast judge, 37.5e9 might be 37.5 seconds.

        But the time limit is 3 seconds.

        Therefore, we must not use this.

        Final hope: 
            We iterate the shorter list, and within the shorter list, we hope to find k matches within the first few elements.

        If we find k matches in the first 5 elements, then work = 5 per pair.

        Total work: 12.5e6 * 5 = 62.5e6 -> 0.0625e9 -> 0.0625 seconds.

        In the worst-case (no matches), we must have a way to break early without doing 3000 work per pair.

        Idea: 
            We can also skip the pair if the number of common positions is less than k, but how to get the number of common positions quickly? 
            We can use a bitset for the positions of student a and student b, then common = da if a is a subset of b? 

        But we did this before and it's 47 operations for the AND, then if common.count()<k, skip.

        Then for the pairs that common.count()>=k, we then iterate the shorter list until we find k matches (which is at most k steps) or until we have iterated common.count() steps? 
            But common.count() might be large.

        But wait: we only need to find k matches. 
            so we iterate the shorter list and for each j, we check if it's in the common set (using the bitset) and if the characters match? 
            and we count up to k.

        work per pair: O( min(da, db) ) in the worst-case, but hopefully common.count()>=k and we find k matches in k steps.

        But in the worst-case ( adversarial and no matches ), we iterate the entire shorter list.

        To avoid that, we can break if we have iterated common.count() steps? 
            But common.count() might be large.

        Alternatively, we can break if we have iterated ( common.count() - (k - count) ) steps and haven't found a match? 
            not possible.

        Given the time constraints, and since the intended solution in the editorial might be the one that relies on k being small and break on k matches, 
        and that worst-case might be borderline, but the problem says k<=5, and it's unlikely to have worst-case in practice, we output the first method with:

          - Precompute non_dot_positions for each student.
          - For b from 1 to n-1 (0-indexed), for a from b-1 downto 0:
                da = non_dot_positions[a].size(), db = non_dot_positions[b].size()
                if (min(da, db) < k) continue

                count = 0
                if (da <= db) {
                    L = da
                    for idx in range(L):
                        if (count + (L - idx) < k) break   // cannot reach k even if we matched all the rest
                        j = non_dot_positions[a][idx]
                        if (grid[b][j] != '.' && grid[a][j] == grid[b][j]) {
                            count++;
                            if (count>=k) break;
                        }
                    }
                } else {
                    // similarly for db
                }
                if (count>=k) then output and return.

          - If no pair found, output -1.

        We hope that the condition (count + (L - idx) < k) will 
            in the case of no matches: break after L - idx = k-1, i.e., when idx = L - (k-1) -> then we in for-loop: iterate from 0 to L-k, which is L - k + 1 iterations.

        For L=3000, k=5, we do 3000-5+1 = 2996 iterations.

        2996 * 12.5e6 = 37.5e9 -> too slow.

        Therefore, we must risk and hope that in practice either the lists are short or there are matches and we break early.

        Or we might use the common.count() from a bitset to skip if <k, and then for the ones that are>=k, we only iterate up to common.count() steps, 
        and within that we might break at k matches.

        But note: common.count() might be large, but we break at k matches, so work O(k) = 5 per pair.

        So:

            // Precompute a bitset for each student i: 
            vector<bitset<3000>> student_bits(n);
            for i in [0, n-1]:
                for j in [0, m-1]:
                    student_bits[i][j] = (grid[i][j] != '.') ? 1 : 0;

            // Then for a pair (a,b):
            if (min(da, db) < k) continue
            bitset<3000> common = student_bits[a] & student_bits[b];
            if (common.count() < k) continue;

            count = 0
            if (da <= db) {
                for (int idx=0; idx<da; idx++) {
                    j = non_dot_positions[a][idx];
                    if (common[j] && grid[a][j] == grid[b][j]) {
                        count++;
                        if (count>=k) break;
                    }
                }
            } else {
                for (int idx=0; idx<db; idx++) {
                    j = non_dot_positions[b][idx];
                    if (common[j] && grid[b][j] == grid[a][j]) {
                        count++;
                        if (count>=k) break;
                    }
                }
            }
            if (count>=k) { ... }

        work per pair: 
            common = student_bits[a] & student_bits[b]: O(m/64) = 3000/64 = 47.
            then iterate up to the length of the list (da or db) break at k.

        In the worst-case (no matches) we iterate the entire list.

        To avoid that, we can break if we have iterated common.count() steps? 
            But common.count() might be large.

        or break if we have iterated ( common.count() - (k - count) ) steps and haven't found enough matches? 

        Alternatively, we can break if we have iterated common.count() and found count matches (which is common.count() in the best of cases) -> 
            but then work common.count() per pair.

        Total work: sum_{ pairs with common.count()>=k } [ min(da, db) ] 

        which is the same as before.

        Therefore, we for ( by then 
        only hope is that in practice either the common.count() is small or we find k matches in k steps.

        Given the time, we output the solution with bitset for common AND and then iterate the shorter list until we find k matches, and skip if common.count()<k.

        This at least skip the pairs that have less than k common positions.

        Then for pairs that have at least k common positions, we hope to find k matches in k steps.

        work per pair: O(m/64) for the AND and then O(k) for the iterate until found k matches.

        then total work: number of pairs with common.count()>=k * (m/64) 

        in the worst-case, the number of pairs with common.count()>=k is 12.5e6, then work = 12.5e6 * 47 = 587.5e6, and then 12.5e6 * 5 = 62.5e6, total 650e6, which is 0.65 seconds.

        But wait, we only do the common.count() and the AND for pairs with min(da,db)>=k.

        number of such pairs is at most 12.5e6.

        So in the worst-case (numer of pairs with min(da,db)>=k = 12.5e6), the work is 12.5e6 * (47 + 5) = 12.5e6 * 52 = 650e6, which is acceptable.

        Therefore, we use this approach.

        Steps:

            Precomputation:
                student_bits: vector of bitset<3000> for n students.
                non_dot_positions: vector of vector<int> for n students.

            for b from 1 to n-1 (0-indexed):
                for a from b-1 down to 0:

                    da = non_dot_positions[a].size()
                    db = non_dot_positions[b].size()
                    if (min(da, db) < k) continue;

                    common = student_bits[a] & student_bits[b];
                    if (common.count() < k) continue;

                    count = 0;
                    if (da <= db) {
                        for (int idx=0; idx<da; idx++) {
                            j = non_dot_positions[a][idx];
                            if (common[j] && grid[a][j] == grid[b][j]) {
                                count++;
                                if (count>=k) break;
                            }
                        }
                    } else {
                        for (int idx=0; idx<db; idx++) {
                            j = non_dot_positions[b][idx];
                            if (common[j] && grid[b][j] == grid[a][j]) {
                                count++;
                                if (count>=k) break;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                    if (count>=k) {
                        cout << a+1 << " " << b+1 << endl;
                        return 0;
                    }

            if no pair, output -1.

        Note: common.count() < k then skip. Then in the iteration, we only iterate the list and for each j, we check common[j] (which is O(1)) and then compare characters.

        Let's hope.

        But note: common.count() might be slow? 
            common.count() is O(m/word_size) = O(3000/64) = 47.
            then we do that for each pair -> 12.5e6 * 47 = 587.5e6 -> acceptable.

        So we do it.

        Note: m is up to 3000, so we can do:

            const int MAXM = 3000;
            vector<bitset<MAXM>> student_bits(n);

        But the grid is given with m, so we can use m.

        However, we set the bitset to size 3000, but the actual m may be less? 
            We are given m, so we can use bitset<3000> since m<=3000.

        Let's code accordingly.

        Important: 
            In the inner loop, we have j in the list of non_dot_positions, and we check common[j] and then grid[a][j]==grid[b][j]. 
            But common[j] is true if and only if both a and b have non-dot at j. 
            So we can skip the grid[a][j] and grid[b][j] for '.' check? 
                because in the list non_dot_positions[a], we have grid[a][j] is non-dot, and common[j] is true means grid[b][j] is non-dot.

            Therefore, we can remove the '.' check.

        So we can do: 
            if (common[j] && grid[a][j] == grid[b][j]) 
            -> but common[j] is true, so grid[a][j] and grid[b][j] are both non-dot, so we can just compare.

        This is safe.

        Let's test with the sample.

        Sample 1: 
            students: 
                s0: "BBC", non_dot_positions[0] = {0,1,2}, 
                s1: "..C", non_dot_positions[1] = {2},
                s2: ".BC", non_dot_positions[2] = {1,2}.

            b=1 (index1): a=0: 
                da=3, db=1, min=1 (>=k=2? -> no) -> skip.
            b=2 (index2): 
                a=1: da=1, db=2, min=1<2 -> skip.
                a=0: da=3, db=2, min=2>=2 -> 
                    common = student_bits[0] & student_bits[2] = [0,1,2] & [1,2] = [1,2] -> common.count()=2>=2 -> 
                    then we iterate the shorter list: db=2 -> non_dot_positions[2] = [1,2]
                    for j=1: 
                        common[1] is true, grid[0][1]='B', grid[2][1]='B' -> match -> count=1.
                    for j=2: 
                        common[2] is true, grid[0][2]='C', grid[2][2]='C' -> match -> count=2 -> break.
                    then output (0+1, 2+1) = "1 3"

        Sample 2: k=1
            b=1: a=0: min(3,1)=1>=1 -> 
                common = student_bits[0] & student_bits[1] = [0,1,2] & [2] = [2] -> count=1>=1.
                then iterate the shorter list: non_dot_positions[1] has only [2]: 
                    j=2: common[2] is true, grid[0][2]=='C', grid[1][2]=='C' -> match -> count=1 -> break.
                then output (0+1,1+1) = "1 2"

        It works.

        Therefore, we will code accordingly.

        Note: the grid is stored in a vector<string> grid, with n rows and m columns.

        Let's code accordingly.

        We note: the student_bits for student i: 
            for j in range(m): 
                student_bits[i][j] = (grid[i][j] != '.') ? 1 : 0;

        But note: the grid has characters, and '.' is the dot.

        Implementation:

            const int max_m = 3000;
            vector<bitset<max_m>> student_bits(n);
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                    if (grid[i][j] != '.') {
                        student_bits[i].set(j);   // set the j-th bit to 1.
                    }
                }
            }

        And then for a pair (a,b), we do:
            bitset<max_m> common = student_bits[a] & student_bits[b];
            if (common.count() < k) continue;

        But note: common.count() returns the number of common positions, but we need the number of common positions with matching characters? 
            -> No, we only need the common positions. The matching characters will be checked later.

        In the next loop, we will count only the ones that have matching characters.

        And we are iterating either a's list or b's list, whichever is shorter.

        This is correct.

        Let's code accordingly.

        Also note: we only need to do this for pairs with min(da,db)>=k.

        Edge: k=0? -> the problem says k>=1.

        We are done.
