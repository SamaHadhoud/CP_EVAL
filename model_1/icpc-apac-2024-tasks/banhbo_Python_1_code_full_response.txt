To solve this problem, we need to count the number of uniform bánh bò hấp assemblies in an \( r \times c \) grid, where each \( 6 \times 7 \) subgrid has the same number of red pieces. The solution leverages the insight that the entire grid must be composed of identical \( 6 \times 7 \) blocks repeated both vertically and horizontally. 

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires that every \( 6 \times 7 \) contiguous subgrid in the \( r \times c \) grid has the same number of red pieces. Given that \( r \) is a multiple of 6 and \( c \) is a multiple of 7, the grid can be divided into \(\frac{r}{6} \times \frac{c}{7}\) blocks, each of size \( 6 \times 7 \). 
2. **Key Insight**: For the uniformity condition to hold across all possible \( 6 \times 7 \) subgrids, all these blocks must be identical. This means the entire grid is determined by a single \( 6 \times 7 \) block.
3. **Counting Valid Grids**: Each cell in the base \( 6 \times 7 \) block can be either red or white, leading to \( 2^{42} \) possible configurations for the base block. The total number of valid grids is therefore \( 2^{42 \times a \times b} \), where \( a = \frac{r}{6} \) and \( b = \frac{c}{7} \).
4. **Modular Exponentiation**: Given the constraints, the exponent \( 42 \times a \times b \) can be very large (up to \( 42 \times 11111 \times 11111 \approx 5.18 \times 10^9 \)). Efficient computation of \( 2^{\text{exponent}} \mod 998244353 \) is achieved using Python's built-in `pow` function with three arguments, which employs fast exponentiation (exponentiation by squaring).

### Solution Code
```python
MOD = 998244353

def main():
    import sys
    r, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    a = r // 6
    b = c // 7
    exponent = 42 * a * b
    result = pow(2, exponent, MOD)
    print(result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers \( r \) and \( c \), representing the dimensions of the grid.
2. **Calculating Blocks**: The grid is divided into \( a = \frac{r}{6} \) vertical blocks and \( b = \frac{c}{7} \) horizontal blocks, each of size \( 6 \times 7 \).
3. **Computing Exponent**: The total number of configurations is \( 2^{42 \times a \times b} \), where \( 42 \) is the number of cells in each base block.
4. **Modular Exponentiation**: The result \( 2^{\text{exponent}} \mod 998244353 \) is computed efficiently using Python's `pow` function, which handles large exponents with logarithmic time complexity via exponentiation by squaring.
5. **Output**: The result is printed, representing the number of uniform bánh bò hấp assemblies modulo \( 998244353 \).

This approach efficiently counts all valid configurations by leveraging the repetition of identical blocks and modular arithmetic to handle large numbers, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limits of the input constraints.
