 We are given the number of tables n and then n binary strings.
 The constraints: 
   n between 2 and 100,000
   The total length of all strings <= 500,000.

 We note:
   total_contestants = sum(|S_i| for all i)

 For each table i with string S_i:
   Let count0 = number of '0' in S_i
   Let count1 = number of '1' in S_i (which is |S_i| - count0)

 The minimal moves for the table if we can set the table arbitrarily to 0 or 1 is min(count0, count1).
 However, after moving, we must have each table as either all 0 or all 1. But note: we can move contestants arbitrarily to any table.

 The key is: we can reassign contestants arbitrarily to any table, and we can leave a table empty.

 However, the problem states: 
   "the destination table must be one of the n tables"

 But note: we can have multiple tables set to the same dish? Yes. The requirement is per table: either empty or all same dish.

 However, the problem does not require that every table must be non-empty. We can leave a table empty.

 The challenge: We must assign each contestant to a table (one of the original n) such that at each table, all have the same dish.

 We are allowed to move contestants arbitrarily (even to different tables). The cost is the number of moves.

 Important: The initial state has each contestant at a table. When we move a contestant, we are removing them from their original table and putting them in a new table (which might be the same as the original? but then why move?).

 Actually, note: we can leave a contestant at the same table. The problem says "move zero or more".

 The idea:

 We can think of the entire process as:
   We are going to assign each contestant to a table (from 1 to n) and also assign each table to a dish (0 or 1) OR leave the table empty.

 However, note: if a table is left empty, then that table does not need to have a dish.

 But observe: the problem says "for each table, at least one of the following must be true: all 0 or all 1". Empty table satisfies both? Actually, if there are no contestants, then the condition is vacuously true.

 So we can have some tables empty and some non-empty.

 How to minimize moves? We can also note that moving a contestant from table i to table j is one move.

 Alternatively, we can think:

   We are going to assign each contestant to one of the n tables arbitrarily. The constraints are:
      At table j: all contestants assigned to table j must have the same dish.

   What dish will be served at table j? We can choose the dish for table j arbitrarily? Actually, we can set the dish for table j to either 0 or 1? But note: the contestant has a dish preference (0 or 1). If we assign a contestant with dish preference 0 to a table that is set to dish 1, then that contestant is not satisfied? 

  But wait: the problem does not say we have to satisfy the dish preference? Actually, the problem says: "the restaurant wants the contestants seated at the same table to have the same order". And also: "after moving the contestants, the following condition should be satisfied by each table: either there is no contestant seated at that table or all contestants seated at that table would like to order the same dish."

  However, note: the problem says "the contestantsâ€™ orders" - meaning the contestant does not change their order. So we cannot change the dish they want. Therefore, we must assign contestants with the same dish to the same table.

  Actually, the problem does not say that we can change the dish. The contestant orders what they want. So the dish is fixed per contestant.

  Therefore, the requirement is: at each table, all the contestants assigned must have the same dish. 

  How can we achieve that? We can only assign contestants that have the same dish to the same table.

  Thus, each table must be assigned only 0s or only 1s.

  Therefore, we have two types of tables: 
      Type 0: assigned only contestants who want dish 0.
      Type 1: assigned only contestants who want dish 1.

  And note: we can have multiple tables of the same type.

  Now, what moves are required? 
      Initially, contestant x is at table i and has dish d.
      We can move them to any table j.

      The cost is the number of moves, i.e., the number of contestants that are not at their original table? Actually, if we move a contestant from table i to table j, that counts as one move.

  We can also leave them at the same table? But if we leave them at the same table, then the table must be set to dish d? However, the table might have multiple contestants and we are free to reassign arbitrarily.

  Alternate viewpoint: 
      We are going to reassign every contestant to a table (which may be the same as the original or different). The constraint: at each table, the dish must be uniform.

      The minimal moves is the same as: total_contestants - (the maximum number of contestants that we can leave at their original table? But note: we can leave a contestant at the original table only if that table ends up being set to the dish that the contestant wants? But the table might be set to a dish that we choose arbitrarily? Actually, we can set the dish for the table arbitrarily? 

      However, note: the table might have multiple contestants. We cannot leave two contestants at the same table if they have different dishes? So if we leave a contestant at a table, then the entire table must be set to the dish of that contestant? and then we can only leave contestants at that table that have that dish.

  So for each table i, we have two choices:
      Option 0: set the table to dish 0. Then we must remove all the 1s at that table (move them elsewhere). The number of contestants we can leave is the count0 at table i.
      Option 1: set the table to dish 1. Then we remove all the 0s at that table. The number we can leave is count1.

  Therefore, for table i, if we choose dish 0, we leave count0 contestants (and move count1); if we choose dish 1, we leave count1 and move count0.

  So the minimal moves for table i if we can choose independently is min(count0, count1). Then the total moves if we set each table independently is the sum over i of min(count0_i, count1_i).

  But wait: what if we move a contestant from table i to table j? Then table j must be set to the dish of that contestant. And we can combine contestants from different tables.

  However, note: the problem does not require that we use the original table for the contestants that we leave. We can completely abandon a table and move all its contestants elsewhere. 

  Therefore, the independent table assignment (choosing dish for each table independently) does not consider that we can move a contestant to another table that we set to the dish they want. 

  How to account for that? 

  We have:
      Total contestants = T.
      The number of moves = T - (the total number of contestants that we do not move).

  How many contestants can we leave at their original table? For table i, if we set it to dish d_i, then we can leave the contestants at table i that have dish d_i. The rest must be moved.

  However, we can also move a contestant to a table that is set to the dish they want, even if that table is not their original table. And if we do that, we don't have to move them again? Actually, if we move a contestant from table i to table j, then we count one move, and then they are at table j and we can leave them there if table j is set to the dish they want.

  Therefore, the entire set of contestants is partitioned arbitrarily among the n tables. The constraint: at each table, all must be same dish.

  How to maximize the number of contestants that are not moved? 
      A contestant that is not moved: they are at the same table as initially and that table is set to their dish.

      However, we can also have contestants that are moved but then are assigned to a table that we set to their dish? But that assignment doesn't count as leaving them? Actually, we are moving them so they are moved. Only contestants that are never moved (i.e., stay at their original table) are not moved? 

  But note: the problem counts a contestant as moved if they are moved to a different table. So if they are at a different table, that counts as one move.

  Therefore, the only contestants that are not moved are those that are at their original table and that table is set to their dish.

  However, we can also leave a contestant at the original table and set the table to the opposite dish? Then we have to move them? Actually, no: if we leave them at the table and set the table to the opposite dish, then they are not satisfied? But wait: the requirement is that at the table all must have the same dish. If we set the table to dish 0, then we must remove all the 1s. So we cannot leave a 1 at a table set to 0.

  Therefore, for a contestant to remain at the original table, we must set that table to the dish they want.

  So the maximum number of contestants that are not moved is the sum over tables i of max(count0_i, count1_i) only if we can assign the dish for table i arbitrarily? 

  However, there is a catch: we have to set the dish for the table. But note: if we set a table to dish 0, then we can leave all the 0s at that table (and move the 1s). Similarly for dish 1.

  So the maximum number of contestants that can be left at their original table is the sum for each table of max(count0_i, count1_i). Then the minimal moves is T - (sum_i max(count0_i, count1_i)).

  But wait: what if we have no table set to dish 0? Then we cannot leave any contestant that wants dish 0 at their original table? Actually, that is already accounted for: if a table has no 0s (so max is count1_i) then we set it to dish 1 and leave all the 1s. But what if we have a contestant that wants dish 0? Then we must move them to a table that we set to dish 0. However, we can set a table to dish 0 even if it originally had more 1s? 

  But note: we are allowed to set the dish arbitrarily for each table. The problem does not require that the dish we set for a table must be the majority of the original table? 

  However, the catch: we can leave a contestant at the original table only if we set that table to the dish they want. But if we set a table to dish 0, then we can leave all the 0s at that table (from the original table) and we can also bring in 0s from other tables? But the ones we bring in are moved (so they count as moves). 

  Therefore, the non-moved contestants are only the ones that are at their original table and that table is set to their dish.

  The key: the non-moved count is independent of where we move the others. The others must be moved (so they count as moves) and then we assign them to a table that we set to their dish. 

  So the moves are T - (sum_i max(count0_i, count1_i)).

  But consider the sample input 1:
        n=4
        S1 = "11101101" -> count0: 2, count1: 6 -> max=6
        S2 = "00" -> count0:2, count1:0 -> max=2
        S3 = "10001" -> count0:3, count1:2 -> max=3
        S4 = "10" -> count0:1, count1:1 -> max=1
        Total max = 6+2+3+1 = 12.
        Total contestants = 8+2+5+2 = 17.
        Moves = 17 - 12 = 5 -> matches.

  However, sample input 2:
        n=2
        S1 = "101010" -> count0:3, count1:3 -> max=3
        S2 = "010101" -> count0:3, count1:3 -> max=3
        Moves = 12 - (3+3) = 6 -> matches.

  And sample input 3:
        n=5
        S1: "0000" -> max=4
        S2: "11" -> max=2
        S3: "0" -> max=1
        S4: "00000000" -> max=8
        S5: "1" -> max=1
        Total max = 4+2+1+8+1 = 16
        Total contestants = 4+2+1+8+1 = 16
        Moves = 0 -> matches.

  But wait: why the sample input 1 example had a solution that moved 5 contestants? Our calculation gives 5. So it matches.

  However, the sample input 1 solution in the problem moved:
      - the seventh contestant initially seated at table 1 to table 3 -> 1 move (a '1' from table1 to table3? but then table3 becomes 1? but table3 originally had 3 zeros and 2 ones? and then we move one more 1 to table3 -> then table3 has 3 ones? but the sample solution says table3 becomes all zeros? 
      Actually, the sample solution says: 
          "You will then have all contestants seated at table 1 ordering phá»Ÿ chÃ­n, while the contestants seated at the other tables will be ordering phá»Ÿ tÃ¡i."

      So table1 becomes all 1s? Then the zeros from table1 must be moved. And table3 becomes all 0s? Then the ones from table3 must be moved.

      How did we get 5 moves? 
          table1: originally 11101101 -> has 2 zeros -> we move those 2 zeros? 
          table3: originally 10001 -> has 2 ones -> we move those 2 ones? 
          table4: originally 10 -> has 1 zero and 1 one -> we move both? 
          But that would be 2+2+2 = 6 moves? 

      The sample solution moved:
          - seventh contestant at table1 (which is '0'? because the string is "11101101": 
                positions: 0-indexed: 
                  0: '1'
                  1: '1'
                  2: '1'
                  3: '0'
                  4: '1'
                  5: '1'
                  6: '0'
                  7: '1'
            so the seventh (if 1-indexed) is the 6th in 0-indexed: which is '0'. 
          - the fourth contestant at table1 (1-indexed fourth is 0-indexed 3) which is '0'. 
          - the first and fifth at table3: 
                table3: "10001": 
                  0: '1'
                  1: '0'
                  2: '0'
                  3: '0'
                  4: '1'
            so first (0-indexed 0) is '1', fifth (0-indexed 4) is '1'.
          - the first at table4: 
                table4: "10": 
                  0: '1'
                  1: '0'
            so the first (0-indexed0) is '1'.

          Total moves: 2 (from table1) + 2 (from table3) + 1 (from table4) = 5.

      How does this work? 
          After moving:
            table1: 
                Original: 11101101 -> we moved two zeros (positions 3 and 6) -> so we have 6 ones left? 
                Then we moved two ones from table3 to table1? and one one from table4? 
                So table1: 6 (original ones) + 2 (from table3) + 1 (from table4) = 9 ones? 
            table2: remains "00" -> 2 zeros? 
            table3: 
                Original: 10001 -> we removed the two ones -> left with "000" -> 3 zeros? 
                Then we got one zero from table1? (the sample solution says: move the seventh (zero) from table1 to table3? and the fourth (zero) from table1 to table4? 
                Actually: 
                  - moved the seventh contestant (zero) from table1 to table3 -> so table3 becomes "000" (original without the ones) + one zero -> 4 zeros? 
                But wait: the sample solution also moved the fourth contestant (zero) from table1 to table4? 
            table4: 
                Original: 10 -> we removed the one? so we have one zero? 
                Then we get one zero from table1? so two zeros? 

          But the sample solution says: 
              table1: all ones -> so 9 ones? 
              the other tables: all zeros -> table2: 2, table3: 4, table4: 2? total zeros = 8? 
          But total ones: originally 6 (table1) + 2 (table3) + 1 (table4) = 9? and zeros: originally 2 (table1) + 3 (table3) + 1 (table4) + 2 (table2) = 8? -> total 17? 

          However, the original total: 8+2+5+2=17 -> matches.

          But then table3 has 4 zeros: which is 4? and table4 has 2 zeros? 

      The key: the contestants moved from table3 (the ones) went to table1? and the zeros from table1 went to table3 and table4? 

      Therefore, the non-moved contestants per table in the original tables:
          table1: the ones that were not moved: the ones that were ones and stayed? -> 6 ones stayed? 
          table2: both zeros stayed? -> 2
          table3: the zeros that were not moved: the three zeros? 
          table4: the zero that was moved? Actually, the sample solution moved the one from table4 to table1 and the zero from table4 stayed? 
          But wait: the solution says "the first contestant initially seated at table4 to table1" -> so the one was moved? and the zero was left? 

      Then non-moved: 
          table1: 6
          table2: 2
          table3: 3
          table4: 1 (the zero that was left? but then we also got a zero moved from table1 to table4? so that moved zero is not counted as non-moved? 
      Actually, non-moved are only those that are at the same table and the table is set to their dish? 
          table1: set to 1 -> the 6 ones that stayed are non-moved? 
          table2: set to 0 -> the 2 zeros that stayed are non-moved? 
          table3: set to 0 -> the 3 zeros that stayed are non-moved? 
          table4: set to 0 -> the 1 zero that stayed is non-moved? 
          Then total non-moved = 6+2+3+1 = 12 -> moves = 17-12 = 5.

  So the formula holds: moves = total_contestants - (sum_i max(count0_i, count1_i)).

  But wait: why did the problem mention the possibility that we might have to force a table to a dish? 

  Actually, the above formula always gives the minimal moves? 

  However, consider the following scenario:

      We have two tables:
        Table1: "0" -> count0=1, count1=0 -> max=1 -> we set it to 0 and leave the 0.
        Table2: "1" -> count0=0, count1=1 -> max=1 -> we set it to 1 and leave the 1.

      Moves = 2 - (1+1) = 0.

      Now, what if we have:
        Table1: "0"
        Table2: "0"

      Then: 
          Table1: max = 1 -> set to 0 -> leave the 0 -> non-moved=1.
          Table2: max = 1 -> set to 0 -> leave the 0 -> non-moved=1.
          Moves = 2 - 2 = 0.

      Now, what if we have:
        Table1: "0"
        Table2: "1"

      Then: 
          Moves = 2 - (1+1) = 0? But we have two tables: one set to 0 and one set to 1. That's valid.

      What if we have:
        Table1: "00" 
        Table2: "11"

      Then non-moved: 2+2 = 4 -> moves = 4-4 = 0.

      Now, what if we have:
        Table1: "01" -> count0=1, count1=1 -> max=1 -> non-moved=1.
        Table2: "01" -> non-moved=1.
        Total non-moved=2 -> moves=4-2=2.

      But we can also do:
          Set table1 to 0: then we must move the 1 from table1 to table2? and move the 0 from table2 to table1? 
          Then table1: "0" (from table1) and "0" (from table2) -> non-moved: the 0 from table1 and the 0 from table2? no: we moved the 0 from table2 to table1? so that one is moved? 
          Actually, we have to move both the 1 from table1 and the 0 from table2? so two moves? 

      Alternatively, set table1 to 0: then we leave the 0 at table1 and move the 1 to table2? 
          Then table2: originally "01", we set table2 to 1? then we leave the 1 at table2 and we bring the 1 from table1? so table2 becomes "1" (original) and "1" (from table1) -> non-moved: the 1 at table2? and the 0 at table1? -> non-moved=2 -> moves=2? 

      So the formula holds.

  However, there is a catch: what if we have no table that can be set to a particular dish? 

  Actually, in our formula, we set each table independently to the dish that minimizes moves. But note: we are allowed to set the dish arbitrarily. So we can set a table to dish 0 even if there are no zeros at that table? Then we have to move all the contestants (because they are ones) -> then non-moved=0. But that is the same as min(count0, count1) = min(0, count1)=0, and max(count0, count1)=count1? 

  But wait: if a table has no zeros, then count0=0, count1>0. Then max=count1. So we set the table to dish 1 and leave all the ones. 

  Similarly, if a table has no ones, we set it to dish 0 and leave all the zeros.

  The catch: what if we have a table that originally has both? We set it to the dish that is the majority. 

  Therefore, the formula holds: moves = total_contestants - sum_i max(count0_i, count1_i).

  But wait: the problem sample input 1: total_contestants=17, and the sum of max=6+2+3+1=12 -> moves=5.

  However, the editorial guidelines above mention:

      "Global Adjustment:
        - If there are contestants wanting dish 0 but no table is naturally set to it, find the minimal loss from forcing a table to dish 0.
        - Similarly, if there are contestants wanting dish 1 but no table is naturally set to it, find the minimal loss from forcing a table to dish 1."

  Why is that? 

  Let me reexamine: 

      The formula we have: moves = total_contestants - sum_i max(count0_i, count1_i) is valid only if we can set the dish for each table arbitrarily? 

  But note: the problem does not require that a table must have at least one contestant? We can set a table to dish 0 even if it originally had no zeros? That is acceptable because we can move zeros from other tables to it? But then the non-moved count for that table would be 0? which is already accounted for: if a table has no zeros, then max = count1 (if we set it to 1) and we leave all the ones? But if we set it to 0, then we have to move all the ones? and then we can bring zeros? but that doesn't help the non-moved count? because the non-moved count only counts contestants that are at their original table.

  Therefore, the non-moved count is fixed per table: for table i, we get max(count0_i, count1_i) non-moved contestants.

  However, the problem in the editorial guidelines says:

      We must ensure that there is at least one table set to dish 0 if there are any contestants wanting dish 0? Why?

      Consider: if we have a contestant that wants dish 0, then we must have at least one table set to dish 0? Otherwise, we cannot assign that contestant to any table? 

      But wait: we can set an empty table to dish 0? Actually, we can set a table to dish 0 even if we move all its original contestants away? Then we bring the contestant that wants dish 0 to that table? 

      However, the non-moved count is only about the contestants that are left at their original table. The contestant that wants dish 0 and is moved to a table that we set to dish 0 is counted as moved (so we subtract nothing for that contestant). 

      Therefore, the non-moved count is independent of the global dish assignment? 

      But note: the non-moved count does not require that the dish we set for the table is the same as the dish we set for the entire restaurant? It is: we set the dish for the table to the majority dish? 

      However, the problem: we must have at least one table set to dish 0 to accommodate any contestant that wants dish 0? But we can set a table to dish 0 even if it originally had no zeros? 

      The catch: when we set a table to dish 0, we are allowed to bring zeros from other tables. But that does not affect the non-moved count: the non-moved count is fixed by the original table and the dish we set for that table.

      Therefore, the formula holds.

  Why then the editorial guidelines mention a global adjustment? 

  Let me read the problem statement again: 
      "after moving the contestants, ... each table: either there is no contestant seated at that table or all contestants seated at that table would like to order the same dish."

  And note: we are not forced to use the dish that we set for the table to be the one that was the majority in the original table? We can set it arbitrarily? 

  So the formula moves = total_contestants - sum_i max(count0_i, count1_i) is always valid.

  However, wait: the problem might have a constraint that we cannot change the dish we set for a table arbitrarily? 

  Actually, we can. The problem says "to satisfy the requirement and the contestantsâ€™ orders", meaning we must assign the contestant to a table that is set to their dish. 

  And we are free to set the dish of each table arbitrarily? 

  Therefore, the formula holds.

  But why the editorial guidelines code has an adjustment?

  The editorial guidelines code:

      saving0 = sum_i max(count0_i, count1_i)

      Then, if (total_zeros > 0 and not has0): 
          saving0 -= min(list_force0)
      Similarly for ones.

  What is `has0`? 
      has0 = True if there exists a table i such that count0_i >= count1_i.

      Similarly, has1 = True if there exists a table i such that count1_i >= count0_i.

  Why is that adjustment necessary? 

  Consider the following scenario:

      We have two tables:
        Table1: "0" -> count0=1, count1=0 -> so max=1 -> and we set it to 0 -> then has0=True, has1=False? but note: we set it to 0, and we don't care about has1? 
        Table2: "0" -> same.

      Then saving0 = 1+1 = 2.

      Now, what if we have:
        Table1: "1" -> count0=0, count1=1 -> max=1 -> we set it to 1 -> then has0=False? (because for table1: count0=0 < count1=1 -> so count0 < count1) -> then we do not set has0? but has0 remains false? 
        Table2: "1"

      Then saving0=1+1=2.

      Now, what if we have:
        Table1: "1" -> count0=0, count1=1 -> max=1 -> we set it to 1 -> so we leave the 1? non-moved=1.
        Table2: "0" -> count0=1, count1=0 -> max=1 -> we set it to 0 -> non-moved=1.

      Then saving0=2.

      Now, what if we have:
        Table1: "1"
        Table2: "1"

      Then saving0=2.

      Now, what if we have:
        Table1: "00"
        Table2: "11"

      saving0=2+2=4.

      Now, what if we have:
        Table1: "0"
        Table2: "1"

      saving0=1+1=2.

      Now, consider a more tricky one:

        Suppose we have two tables and only dish 0 contestants? 
          Table1: "1" (so only one contestant, dish1)
          Table2: "1"

          Then total_zeros=0? so we skip the adjustment for dish0? 
          total_ones=2>0, and has1? 
            For table1: count0=0, count1=1 -> so count1>=count0 -> has1 becomes True? 
            Similarly for table2 -> has1 is True? 

          Then no adjustment.

        Moves=2 - (1+1)=0? 

        But we have two contestants that want dish1. How can we leave them? 
            We set table1 to dish1 -> leave the contestant at table1? non-moved=1.
            We set table2 to dish1 -> leave the contestant at table2? non-moved=1.
            Then moves=0.

        That is valid.

      Now, consider:

        We have two tables and dish0 contestants and dish1 contestants? 
          Table1: "1" -> count0=0, count1=1 -> max=1 -> non-moved=1 -> and we set it to 1 -> so has1=True? 
          Table2: "1" -> same.

        Then saving0=2.

        But now, what if we have a dish0 contestant? Actually, in this example, we don't.

      Now, what if we have:

        Table1: "111" -> count0=0, count1=3 -> max=3 -> non-moved=3 -> has0=False? because count0=0 < count1=3 -> so has0=False? 
        Table2: "111" -> same.

        Then saving0=3+3=6.

        But total_zeros=0 -> skip adjustment.

        Moves = 6 - 6 = 0.

      Now, what if we have:

        Table1: "111" 
        Table2: "000"

        Then saving0=3+3=6 -> moves=0? 

        How? We set table1 to dish1 -> leave the three ones? non-moved=3.
        Set table2 to dish0 -> leave the three zeros? non-moved=3.

        That's valid.

      Now, the critical example:

        We have two tables:
          Table1: "0" -> count0=1, count1=0 -> max=1 -> we set to 0 -> has0 becomes True? (because 1>=0) -> and has1? (0>=1 -> false) -> so has1 remains false? 
          Table2: "0" 

        Then total_zeros=2>0 -> has0 is True -> no adjustment.
        total_ones=0 -> skip adjustment for ones.

        saving0=1+1=2 -> moves=0.

      Now, what if we have:

        Table1: "0" 
        Table2: "1"

        Then:
          Table1: count0=1, count1=0 -> max=1 -> we set to 0 -> has0=True, has1? for table1: count1=0>=count0=1? -> false -> so has1 remains false? 
          Table2: count0=0, count1=1 -> max=1 -> we set to 1 -> has1: for table2: count1=1>=count0=0 -> true -> so has1 becomes True? 

        Then saving0=2 -> moves=0.

      Now, the scenario that requires adjustment:

        Suppose we have two tables and both have a majority of dish1? and there is a dish0 contestant? 
          Table1: "10" -> count0=1, count1=1 -> max=1 -> we can set to either dish? 
          Table2: "1" -> count0=0, count1=1 -> max=1.

        total_zeros=1>0 -> so we need at least one table set to dish0? 
        But in the current setting, we have two tables: 
          We set table1 to dish0? then we leave the 0? and move the 1? 
          Then table2: we set to dish1 -> leave the 1? non-moved=1 (from table1) + 1 (from table2) = 2.

          Or we set table1 to dish1? then we leave the 1? and move the 0? 
          Then table2: dish1 -> leave the 1? non-moved=1+1=2.

        But note: we have one dish0 contestant. We must have at least one table set to dish0? 
          If we set both tables to dish1, then the dish0 contestant has nowhere to go? 

        How do we assign the dish0 contestant? 
          We must set at least one table to dish0? 

        But in the above, we are forced to set one table to dish0? 

        Actually, we have two tables and we can set one to dish0 and one to dish1? 

        However, in the independent setting for table1: we have two choices? 
          We can choose dish0: then non-moved=1 (the 0) -> and then we have a table set to dish0? 
          Or dish1: then non-moved=1 (the 1) -> and then we have no table set to dish0? 

        Why is that? 
          If we set table1 to dish1, then we leave the 1 at table1? and move the 0 to table2? 
          Then we set table2 to dish1? so we have the 1 at table2 and we bring the 0 from table1? but then we cannot put the 0 at table2 because table2 is set to dish1? 

        Actually, we must move the 0 to a table that is set to dish0? 
          We have two tables: 
            We set table1 to dish1 -> then the only table set to dish0 is ... none? 
            We set table2 to dish1 -> then we have no table set to dish0? 

        Therefore, we must set at least one table to dish0? 

        How can we do that? 
          We can set table1 to dish0? then we have one table set to dish0? 
          Or we can set table2 to dish0? but table2 has no zeros? then we set table2 to dish0? then we must move the 1 from table2 to table1? and we set table1 to dish1? 

        Then the non-moved count:
          Option 1: 
             Table1: set to 0 -> leave the 0 -> non-moved=1.
             Table2: set to 1 -> leave the 1 -> non-moved=1.
             Total non-moved=2 -> moves=0? 

          But wait: we also have the 1 at table1? we must move it to table2? and the 0 at table2? we don't have a 0 at table2? 
          Actually, table2 originally had "1". We set it to 1? then we leave the 1? and we move the 1 from table1 to table2? -> then table2 has two ones? 

          Then the non-moved: 
             table1: the 0 that stayed -> non-moved=1.
             table2: the 1 that stayed -> non-moved=1.
          And we moved the 1 from table1 to table2? one move? 

          But our formula: 
             table1: max(1,1)=1 -> non-moved=1.
             table2: max(0,1)=1 -> non-moved=1.
          Total non-moved=2 -> moves=2 (since total contestants=2+1=3? wait: total contestants: table1 has 2, table2 has 1 -> total=3) -> moves=3-2=1.

        How did we get 1? 

        Now, if we set table1 to dish0 and table2 to dish1, then:
          table1: we leave the 0 -> non-moved=1.
          table1: the 1 must be moved to table2? -> one move.
          table2: we leave the 1 -> non-moved=1.
          Then total non-moved=2, moves=1.

        Alternatively, if we set table1 to dish1 and table2 to dish0? 
          table1: leave the 1 -> non-moved=1.
          table1: move the 0 to table2? -> one move.
          table2: we leave the 1? but wait, table2 is set to dish0? so we cannot leave the 1? we must move the 1 from table2 to table1? 
          Then we move the 1 from table2 to table1? then table1: has the original 1 and the moved 1? and table2: has the moved 0? 
          Then non-moved: table1: the original 1 -> non-moved=1? 
          But the 1 from table2 was moved? so we have two moves? 
          Actually: 
              Move the 0 from table1 to table2: one move.
              Move the 1 from table2 to table1: one move.
          Total moves=2.

        So the minimal moves is 1.

        How does the formula work?
          table1: "10" -> count0=1, count1=1 -> max=1.
          table2: "1" -> count0=0, count1=1 -> max=1.
          saving0 = 1+1 = 2.
          moves = 3 - 2 = 1.

        But the editorial guidelines adjustment: 
          total_zeros=1>0 -> we check has0: 
             table1: count0=1>=count1=1 -> True -> so has0=True? 
             table2: count0=0<count1=1 -> so not set to 0? 
          So has0 is True? because table1 can be set to 0? 

          Similarly, has1: 
             table1: count1=1>=count0=1 -> True? 
             table2: count1=1>=count0=0 -> True? 
          So no adjustment.

        Then moves=1 -> correct.

        Now, modify the example: 
          Table1: "11" -> count0=0, count1=2 -> max=2 -> we set to 1 -> non-moved=2 -> has0: for table1: 0>=2? false -> so has0=False? 
          Table2: "0" -> count0=1, count1=0 -> max=1 -> we set to 0 -> non-moved=1 -> has0: True? 
          Then total_zeros=1>0 -> and has0 is True -> no adjustment.

          saving0=2+1=3 -> moves= (2+1) - 3 = 0? 

        But wait: we have a dish0 contestant? and we set table2 to dish0? so we can leave the dish0 contestant at table2? 
        And table1: dish1? we leave the two ones? 
        moves=0.

        Now, modify again: 
          Table1: "11" -> count0=0, count1=2 -> max=2 -> set to 1 -> non-moved=2 -> has0? false.
          Table2: "11" -> same.

          Then total_zeros=0 -> skip adjustment for dish0.
          total_ones=4>0 -> has1? 
             table1: count1=2>=count0=0 -> True -> has1=True? 
             table2: True -> so no adjustment.

          saving0=2+2=4 -> moves=4-4=0.

        Now, the critical example that requires adjustment:

          Table1: "11" -> count0=0, count1=2 -> max=2 -> set to 1 -> non-moved=2 -> has0? false.
          Table2: "11" -> same.

          Then we add one more table:
          Table3: "0" -> count0=1, count1=0 -> max=1 -> non-moved=1 -> has0? true.

          Then total_zeros=1>0 -> but has0 is true? so no adjustment.

          saving0=2+2+1=5 -> moves= (2+2+1) - 5 = 0.

        Now, what if we remove table3? 
          Only table1 and table2: 
            Table1: "11" -> has0? false.
            Table2: "11" -> has0? false.
          Then total_zeros=0 -> skip adjustment for dish0.
          total_ones=4>0 -> but has1? true? -> no adjustment.

          saving0=4 -> moves=0.

        But wait: if we have a dish0 contestant? Actually, in this example, there are none.

        Now, the scenario that requires adjustment: 

          We have dish0 contestants? but no table that can be naturally set to dish0? 

          Example:
            Table1: "1" -> count0=0, count1=1 -> max=1 -> set to 1 -> non-moved=1 -> has0? false.
            Table2: "1" -> same.

          And we have a dish0 contestant? Actually, we don't. total_zeros=0 -> skip adjustment.

          How do we get a dish0 contestant? We need at least one.

          Example with dish0 contestant:

            Table1: "10" -> count0=1, count1=1 -> but note: we have two contestants at table1? 
            Table2: "1"

            Then:
              Table1: count0=1, count1=1 -> max=1 -> we can set to 0 or 1 -> so has0 and has1 both true? 
              Table2: count0=0, count1=1 -> max=1 -> set to 1 -> has1 true, has0 false.

            Then no adjustment.

          Now, consider:

            Table1: "1" 
            Table2: "1"
            Table3: "0" -> but we remove the table3? 

          How about:

            Table1: "111"
            Table2: "111"
            Table3: "000" -> but we remove the table3? 

          How about:

            Table1: "111"
            Table2: "111"
            And we have a dish0 contestant? But we don't have any dish0 contestant? 

          We need an example with dish0 contestants and no table that can be naturally set to dish0? 

          Example:

            Table1: "11" -> count0=0, count1=2 -> max=2 -> set to 1 -> non-moved=2 -> has0? false.
            Table2: "11" -> same.

            And we have a dish0 contestant? How? 
              Actually, there are none. total_zeros=0.

          How to get dish0 contestant? 

            Table1: "110" -> count0=1, count1=2 -> max=2 -> set to 1 -> non-moved=2 -> has0? false (because count0=1 < count1=2) -> so not naturally set to 0? 
            Table2: "110"

            Then total_zeros=2>0.

            has0: 
                table1: count0=1 < count1=2 -> false.
                table2: false.
            Then we need adjustment for dish0.

            saving0 = 2+2 = 4.
            Then we subtract the minimal loss for dish0: 
                For table1: if we force to set to dish0, then the non-moved would be count0=1? so the loss compared to the best we can do for table1 (which is 2) is 2-1=1.
                For table2: similarly loss=1.
            Then minimal loss=1.
            Then saving0 = 4 - 1 = 3.

            moves = (3+3) - 3 = 3? 

            total_contestants=3+3=6.

            How many moves? 6-3=3.

          Why is this necessary?

          Explanation: 
            In the independent setting, we would set both tables to dish1 -> then the non-moved=2+2=4 -> moves=2.
            But then we have two dish0 contestants that are moved? and we have to assign them to a table set to dish0? 
            However, we have no table set to dish0? because both tables are set to dish1? 
            Therefore, we must force at least one table to dish0? 

            If we force table1 to dish0, then:
                Table1: we leave the one dish0 contestant? non-moved=1 -> we have to move the two dish1 contestants? 
                Table2: we set to dish1? non-moved=2 (the two dish1) -> then we move the dish0 contestant from table2 to table1? 
                Moves: 
                    from table1: move the two ones: 2 moves.
                    from table2: move the one zero: 1 move.
                Total moves=3.

            Alternatively, we could move both dish0 contestants to a new table? but we can only use existing tables? 
            We can force table1 to dish0: then we can bring the dish0 contestant from table2 to table1? 
            Then we have table1: one dish0 (from table1) and one dish0 (from table2) -> so non-moved at table1: only the original dish0? the moved dish0 is not non-moved? 
            Then non-moved count: table1: 1, table2: 2 -> total non-moved=3 -> moves=6-3=3.

          Therefore, the adjustment is: because we have no table that is naturally set to dish0 (meaning in our independent setting we did not set any table to dish0), we have to convert one table to dish0, which will cost us: we lose (max_i - min_i) for that table? Actually, we lose (max_i - min_i) = (count1_i - count0_i) for that table? 

          In the example: for table1: 
              if set to dish1: non-moved=2.
              if set to dish0: non-moved=1.
              so the loss is 1.

          Therefore, the total non-moved becomes: 
              saving0 (which was 4) - 1 = 3.

          And moves=6-3=3.

          Without adjustment, we would have moves=2? but that is not feasible because we have no table set to dish0.

      Therefore, the adjustment is necessary.

  The algorithm:

      saving0 = 0
      has0 = False
      has1 = False
      list_force0 = []   # to record the loss (max_i - count0_i) if we force a table that is not naturally set to 0 to be set to 0
      list_force1 = []   # similarly for dish1.

      For each table:
          count0 = count of '0'
          count1 = len - count0
          saving0 += max(count0, count1)

          if count0 >= count1:
              has0 = True
          if count1 >= count0:
              has1 = True

          # If we force this table to dish0 (even if it wasn't chosen as the dish0 in the independent setting) then the loss is: 
          #   loss0 = max(count0, count1) - count0
          # Similarly for dish1: loss1 = max(count0, count1) - count1
          # But note: if count0>=count1, then we wouldn't force to dish0? because we naturally set it to dish0? so we only consider forcing for tables that are not naturally set to dish0? 
          # Actually, we are going to consider for dish0 only the tables that are not naturally set to dish0? i.e., count0 < count1.
          if count0 < count1:
              loss0 = count1 - count0   # because max(count0,count1)=count1, then if we set to 0, we get count0, so loss = count1 - count0.
              list_force0.append(loss0)
          if count1 < count0:
              loss1 = count0 - count1
              list_force1.append(loss1)

      Then:
          if total_zeros > 0 and not has0:
              # There is at least one dish0 contestant and no table is naturally set to dish0.
              # We must force one table to dish0. We choose the one with minimal loss.
              saving0 -= min(list_force0)
          if total_ones > 0 and not has1:
              saving0 -= min(list_force1)

      moves = total_contestants - saving0

  Let's test on the example that requires adjustment:

      Tables: 
          Table1: "110" -> count0=1, count1=2 -> saving0 += 2.
          Table2: "110" -> same: saving0=4.

          For table1: 
              count0=1, count1=2 -> count0<count1 -> so we add loss0=2-1=1 to list_force0.
              count0>=count1? False -> so has0 remains false (so far).
              count1>=count0? True -> so has1 becomes True.
          Similarly for table2: same -> list_force0 has two ones? and has0 remains false? 

          Then:
            total_zeros = 1+1 = 2>0 -> and has0 is False -> so we do: saving0 -= min(list_force0) = min([1,1]) = 1 -> saving0=3.
            total_ones=2+2=4>0 -> has1 is True -> no adjustment.

          moves = 6 - 3 = 3.

  Another example:

      Two tables:
        Table1: "1" -> count0=0, count1=1 -> saving0=1.
          count0<count1? 0<1 -> True: add loss0=1-0=1 to list_force0.
          has0: count0>=count1? 0>=1 -> False -> so has0 remains False (so far).
          has1: count1>=count0? 1>=0 -> True -> has1 becomes True.
        Table2: "0" -> count0=1, count1=0 -> saving0=1+1=2.
          count0>=count1? 1>=0 -> True -> has0 becomes True.
          count1>=count0? 0>=1 -> False.

        total_zeros=1>0 -> but has0 is True -> no adjustment.
        total_ones=1>0 -> has1 is True -> no adjustment.

        moves= (1+1) - 2 = 0.

  But what if we swap the dishes? 
        Table1: "0" -> count0=1, count1=0 -> saving0=1.
          has0: True, has1: False? 
          list_force1: since count1<count0? 0<1 -> True: loss1=1-0=1.
        Table2: "1" -> count0=0, count1=1 -> saving0=2.
          has0: becomes True? no, table2: count0>=count1? 0>=1->False, count1>=count0? True -> so has1 becomes True.
        Then adjustment: 
          total_zeros=1>0 -> has0 is True -> skip.
          total_ones=1>0 -> has1 is True -> skip.
        moves=0.

  Now, force adjustment for dish1:

      Tables:
        Table1: "00" -> count0=2, count1=0 -> saving0=2.
          has0: True, has1: False? 
          list_force1: [2] (because count1=0<2, loss1=2-0=2)
        Table2: "00" -> same: saving0=4, list_force1=[2,2]

        total_zeros=4>0 -> has0 is True -> skip.
        total_ones=0 -> skip dish1 adjustment.

        moves=4-4=0.

      But if we have dish1 contestant? we don't. So no problem.

  Now, an example that requires adjustment for both:

      Tables:
        Table1: "10" -> count0=1, count1=1 -> saving0=1.
          has0: True (because 1>=1), has1: True.
          no force lists? because count0>=count1 and count1>=count0 -> so no entry in list_force0 or list_force1.

        Table2: "10" -> same.

        Then we have dish0 and dish1? total_zeros=2, total_ones=2.

        Then no adjustment? saving0=1+1=2, moves=4-2=2.

      But we can do: 
          Set table1 to dish0: leave the 0 -> move the 1 to table2? 
          Set table2 to dish1: leave the 1 -> move the 0 to table1? 
          Then non-moved: table1:0, table2:1 -> non-moved=2.
          Moves=2.

      Now, force both dishes? 
          But we have both has0 and has1? so no adjustment.

      How about if we have:

        Table1: "1100" -> count0=2, count1=2 -> saving0=2.
        Table2: "11" -> count0=0, count1=2 -> saving0=2+2=4.
        Table3: "00" -> count0=2, count1=0 -> saving0=4+2=6.

        total_contestants=4+2+2=8.
        has0: 
            table1: count0=2>=count1=2 -> True.
            table2: count0=0<2 -> so has0? we already have True? 
            table3: True.
        has1:
            table1: True.
            table2: count1=2>=0 -> True.
            table3: count1=0<2 -> but we already have True.

        Then no adjustment? moves=8-6=2.

      But wait: we have dish0 and dish1? 
          How many dish0: table1:2, table3:2 -> total=4.
          dish1: table1:2, table2:2 -> total=4.

        Now, we can set:
          table1: set to dish0: then leave the 2 zeros? move the 2 ones? 
          table2: set to dish1: leave the 2 ones? 
          table3: set to dish0: leave the 2 zeros? 
          Then non-moved: table1:2, table2:2, table3:2 -> 6? moves=2.

        But we also have the ones from table1? we move them to table2? then table2 becomes 2+2=4? that's allowed.

      However, the above assignment is valid.

      Now, what if we remove the natural setting for dish0 in table1 and table3? 
        We change table1 to "111000" -> count0=3, count1=3 -> saving0=3.
        table2: "111" -> saving0=3+3=6.
        table3: "000" -> saving0=6+3=9.

        total_contestants=6+3+3=12.
        has0: table1: True, table3: True -> so no adjustment.
        moves=12-9=3.

      But wait: we have dish0 and dish1? 
        We set table1 to dish0: leave the 3 zeros? move the 3 ones? 
        table2: dish1: leave the 3 ones? 
        table3: dish0: leave the 3 zeros? 
        non-moved=3+3+3=9 -> moves=3.

      Now, remove the natural setting for dish0? 

        Table1: "111000" -> count0=3, count1=3 -> still natural for dish0? because 3>=3 -> True.

      How to get a table that is not natural for dish0? 

        Table1: "1110000" -> count0=4, count1=3 -> then if we set to dish0: non-moved=4, which is the max -> so natural for dish0? 
        But if we set to dish1: non-moved=3, which is less.

        So we would naturally set it to dish0? 

      To have a table that is not natural for dish0, we need count0 < count1.

      How about:

        Table1: "1110" -> count0=1, count1=3 -> saving0=3.
        Table2: "1110" -> saving0=6.
        Table3: "1110" -> saving0=9.

        total_contestants=4+4+4=12.
        has0: 
            table1: count0=1<3 -> false.
            table2: false.
            table3: false.
            so has0=False.
        total_zeros=3>0 -> so we adjust: 
            list_force0: for each table, loss0 = 3-1=2 -> list_force0=[2,2,2] -> min=2.
            saving0 = 9-2 = 7.

        has1: 
            table1: count1=3>=1 -> True -> has1=True.
            table2: True.
            table3: True.
        total_ones=9>0 -> has1=True -> no adjustment.

        moves=12-7=5.

      How to achieve 5 moves? 
          We must force one table to dish0. Suppose we force table1 to dish0: 
             Then we leave the 1 zero? and move the 3 ones? 
          Then table2 and table3 we set to dish1? 
             Table2: leave the 3 ones? move the 1 zero? 
             Table3: leave the 3 ones? move the 1 zero? 
          Moves: 
             Table1: 3 moves (the ones)
             Table2: 1 move (the zero)
             Table3: 1 move (the zero)
          Total moves=5.

      But note: we have the zeros: 
          Table1: one zero (non-moved) and we move the two zeros from table2 and table3 to table1? 
          Actually, we don't have to move them to table1? we can move them to table1? 
          Then table1: has one (non-moved) and two (moved) -> so table1 has three zeros? 
          Then non-moved: 
             table1: 1 (the original zero) -> non-moved=1.
             table2: 3 ones -> non-moved=3.
             table3: 3 ones -> non-moved=3.
          Total non-moved=7 -> moves=12-7=5.

      Therefore, the adjustment is necessary.

  Conclusion: 
      The code in the editorial guidelines is correct.

  Note: The constraints state that the total length of all strings is at most 500,000, so the counting and the loops are efficient.

  Let's code accordingly.

  However, note: the problem states that the initial state has at least one contestant per table.

  We'll do:

      total_contestants = 0
      total_zeros = 0
      total_ones = 0
      saving0 = 0
      has0 = False
      has1 = False
      list_force0 = []   # loss if forcing to 0 for tables that are not naturally set to 0 (i.e., count0 < count1)
      list_force1 = []   # loss if forcing to 1 for tables that are not naturally set to 1 (i.e., count1 < count0)

      for each string in the list of n strings:
          L = len(string)
          count0 = string.count('0')
          count1 = L - count0
          total_contestants += L
          total_zeros += count0
          total_ones += count1
          saving0 += max(count0, count1)

          if count0 >= count1:
              has0 = True
          if count1 >= count0:
              has1 = True

          if count0 < count1:
              loss0 = count1 - count0
              list_force0.append(loss0)
          if count1 < count0:
              loss1 = count0 - count1
              list_force1.append(loss1)

      if total_zeros > 0 and not has0:
          if list_force0:   # it should be non-empty because there is at least one table that is not naturally set to 0? but if not, then we skip?
              min_loss0 = min(list_force0)
              saving0 -= min_loss0
          # else: no table to force to dish0? then it's impossible? but the problem says at least one contestant per table initially, and total_zeros>0, so there must be at least one table with at least one zero? and then if count0>=count1 would be false for all, then each table has count0<count1? so list_force0 is non-empty? 
      if total_ones > 0 and not has1:
          if list_force1:
              min_loss1 = min(list_force1)
              saving0 -= min_loss1

      moves = total_contestants - saving0

  Print moves.

  Let's run the sample inputs:

      Sample 1: 
        Tables: 
          "11101101": count0=2, count1=6 -> max=6 -> saving0=6; has0? 2>=6? no -> has1? 6>=2? yes -> so has1 becomes True. 
                count0<count1 -> loss0=6-2=4 -> list_force0.append(4)
          "00": count0=2, count1=0 -> max=2; has0: 2>=0 -> True; has1: 0>=2? false -> so has0=True, has1 unchanged (True). 
                count1<count0? 0<2 -> loss1=2-0=2 -> list_force1.append(2)
          "10001": count0=3, count1=2 -> max=3; has0: 3>=2 -> True; has1: 2>=3? false -> so nothing new for has1? 
                count1<count0? True -> loss1=3-2=1 -> list_force1.append(1)
          "10": count0=1, count1=1 -> max=1; has0: 1>=1 -> True; has1: 1>=1 -> True. 
                no force list.

          total_zeros=2+2+3+1=8? Actually: 
            table1:2, table2:2, table3:3, table4:1 -> total_zeros=8? 
            total_ones=6+0+2+1=9? 

          Then: 
            total_zeros>0 -> and has0 is True -> skip adjustment for dish0.
            total_ones>0 -> and has1 is True -> skip adjustment for dish1.

          saving0=6+2+3+1=12.
          moves=17-12=5 -> matches.

      Sample 2:
          "101010": count0=3, count1=3 -> max=3; has0: True; has1: True; no force lists.
          "010101": same: max=3; has0: True; has1: True; no force lists.
          saving0=3+3=6.
          moves=12-6=6 -> matches.

      Sample 3:
          "0000": count0=4, count1=0 -> max=4; has0: True; has1: 0>=4? false -> then add to list_force1: loss1=4-0=4.
          "11": count0=0, count1=2 -> max=2; has0: 0>=2? false; has1: True -> then add to list_force0: loss0=2-0=2.
          "0": count0=1, count1=0 -> max=1; has0: True; has1: false -> add to list_force1: loss1=1-0=1.
          "00000000": count0=8, count1=0 -> max=8; has0: True; has1: false -> add to list_force1: 8.
          "1": count0=0, count1=1 -> max=1; has0: false; has1: True -> add to list_force0: 1.

          total_zeros=4+0+1+8+0=13? 
          total_ones=0+2+0+0+1=3

          Then:
            dish0: total_zeros>0 -> has0 is True -> skip.
            dish1: total_ones>0 -> has1 is True -> skip.

          saving0=4+2+1+8+1=16.
          moves=16-16=0.

  Therefore, we code accordingly.

  Note: the problem says the total length of strings is at most 500,000, so we can use the string.count('0') method which is O(n) per string, but the sum of the lengths is 500,000, so it is efficient.

  We'll write the code accordingly.

  However, note: the sample input 1 has 8+2+5+2 = 17, which is within the total.

  Let's code.

  Important: the problem states that there is at least one contestant per table initially.

  We read n, then n lines.

  We'll do:

      data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()
      n = int(data[0])
      strings = data[1:1+n]

  Then process each string.

  Let's run the provided examples.

  We'll also test the critical example we discussed.

  Example: two tables: ["1", "0"] -> 
        n=2
        s1="1": 
            count0=0, count1=1 -> saving0=1; 
                has0: 0>=1? False -> has1: 1>=0? True -> so has1=True, has0=False? 
                force0: since count0<count1 -> loss0=1 -> list_force0=[1]
        s2="0":
            count0=1, count1=0 -> saving0=1+1=2;
                has0: 1>=0 -> True -> so has0 becomes True.
                force1: count1<count0 -> loss1=1 -> list_force1=[1]

        total_zeros=1, total_ones=1.
        dish0: total_zeros>0 and not has0? -> has0 is True -> skip.
        dish1: total_ones>0 and not has1? -> has1 is True -> skip.

        moves=2-2=0 -> correct.

  Another critical: 
        Tables: ["110", "110"] -> 
          s1: "110": count0=1, count1=2 -> saving0=2; 
                has0: 1>=2? False -> has1: True -> force0: loss0=1 -> list_force0=[1]
          s2: "110": same -> saving0=4; list_force0=[1,1]
          total_zeros=2, total_ones=4.
          dish0: has0=False -> so we adjust: min(list_force0)=1 -> saving0=4-1=3.
          dish1: has1=True -> skip.
          moves= (3+3) - 3 = 3? total_contestants=6 -> moves=3.

  Correct.

  Code:
