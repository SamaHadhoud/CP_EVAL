 We are given n (3 to 30) and a convex polygon in counter-clockwise order.
 We are to find the minimum area of a convex, point-symmetric region that contains all the n vertices on its boundary, if exists; else output -1.

 Steps:
 1. If the polygon is centrally symmetric (with even n and each point has a symmetric partner at i+n/2) then the polygon itself is a candidate.

 2. Generate candidate centers c from:
    a) The midpoints of every pair of vertices: c = (v_i + v_j)/2.
    b) Solving systems of equations from collinearity conditions (Type 2 and Type 3). We generate linear equations from:
        Type 2: For three distinct vertices i, j, k, the symmetric point of k (i.e., 2c - v_k) must be collinear with v_i and v_j.
                This gives: (v_j - v_i) × ( (2c - v_k) - v_i ) = 0   [cross product]
                => (v_j.x - v_i.x)*(2c.y - v_k.y - v_i.y) - (v_j.y - v_i.y)*(2c.x - v_k.x - v_i.x) = 0
                Rearranged: 
                  2*(v_j.x - v_i.x)*c.y - 2*(v_j.y - v_i.y)*c.x = (v_j.x - v_i.x)*(v_k.y + v_i.y) - (v_j.y - v_i.y)*(v_k.x + v_i.x)

        Type 3: For three distinct vertices i, j, k, the symmetric points of j and k (2c - v_j, 2c - v_k) are collinear with the original vertex v_i.
                => ( (2c - v_j) - v_i ) × ( (2c - v_k) - v_i ) = 0
                But note: we can express the condition as: 
                  (2c - v_j - v_i) × (2c - v_k - v_i) = 0
                => [2(c.x) - (v_j.x+v_i.x)] * [2(c.y) - (v_k.y+v_i.y)] - [2(c.y) - (v_j.y+v_i.y)] * [2(c.x) - (v_k.x+v_i.x)] = 0
                This is a linear equation? Actually, it is quadratic. But note: the problem analysis says linear? Let me check.

    Actually, the editorial guidelines say: 
        "Type 2: ... This gives a linear equation in c."
        "Type 3: ... This also gives a linear equation in c."

    How? 

    For Type 3: 
        Condition: v_i, (2c - v_j), (2c - v_k) are collinear.
        Then the vectors ( (2c - v_j) - v_i ) and ( (2c - v_k) - v_i ) must be parallel.
        => (2c - v_j - v_i) × (2c - v_k - v_i) = 0

        Let A = 2c - v_j - v_i = (2c_x - v_j.x - v_i.x, 2c_y - v_j.y - v_i.y)
        Let B = 2c - v_k - v_i = (2c_x - v_k.x - v_i.x, 2c_y - v_k.y - v_i.y)

        Then: 
          A_x * B_y - A_y * B_x = 0
          => (2c_x - v_j.x - v_i.x)*(2c_y - v_k.y - v_i.y) - (2c_y - v_j.y - v_i.y)*(2c_x - v_k.x - v_i.x) = 0

        Expand:
          4 c_x c_y - 2 c_x (v_k.y+v_i.y) - 2 c_y (v_j.x+v_i.x) + (v_j.x+v_i.x)*(v_k.y+v_i.y) 
          - [4 c_x c_y - 2 c_x (v_j.y+v_i.y) - 2 c_y (v_k.x+v_i.x) + (v_j.y+v_i.y)*(v_k.x+v_i.x)] = 0

        The 4 c_x c_y terms cancel. Then:
          -2 c_x (v_k.y+v_i.y) -2 c_y (v_j.x+v_i.x) + (v_j.x+v_i.x)*(v_k.y+v_i.y)
          +2 c_x (v_j.y+v_i.y) +2 c_y (v_k.x+v_i.x) - (v_j.y+v_i.y)*(v_k.x+v_i.x) = 0

        Rearranged:
          2 c_x [ (v_j.y+v_i.y) - (v_k.y+v_i.y) ] + 2 c_y [ (v_k.x+v_i.x) - (v_j.x+v_i.x) ] 
          = (v_j.y+v_i.y)*(v_k.x+v_i.x) - (v_j.x+v_i.x)*(v_k.y+v_i.y)

        Simplify:
          2 c_x (v_j.y - v_k.y) + 2 c_y (v_k.x - v_j.x) 
          = (v_j.y*v_k.x + v_j.y*v_i.x + v_i.y*v_k.x + v_i.y*v_i.x) - (v_j.x*v_k.y + v_j.x*v_i.y + v_i.x*v_k.y + v_i.x*v_i.y)

        However, note that the terms with v_i.x*v_i.y cancel? Actually, we can rearrange the right-hand side as:
          = v_j.y*v_k.x - v_j.x*v_k.y 
            + v_j.y*v_i.x - v_j.x*v_i.y 
            + v_i.y*v_k.x - v_i.x*v_k.y 
            + v_i.y*v_i.x - v_i.x*v_i.y   [but the last two terms: v_i.y*v_i.x - v_i.x*v_i.y = 0]

        So: 
          = (v_j.y*v_k.x - v_j.x*v_k.y) + (v_j.y*v_i.x - v_j.x*v_i.y) + (v_i.y*v_k.x - v_i.x*v_k.y)

        Alternatively, we can write:
          = v_i.x*(v_j.y - v_k.y) + v_i.y*(v_k.x - v_j.x) + (v_j.y*v_k.x - v_j.x*v_k.y)

        Then the equation becomes:
          2(v_j.y - v_k.y) c_x + 2(v_k.x - v_j.x) c_y 
          = v_i.x*(v_j.y - v_k.y) + v_i.y*(v_k.x - v_j.x) + (v_j.y*v_k.x - v_j.x*v_k.y)

        But note: 
          The left-hand side: 2(v_j.y - v_k.y) c_x + 2(v_k.x - v_j.x) c_y
          The right-hand side: (v_j.y - v_k.y)*v_i.x + (v_k.x - v_j.x)*v_i.y + (v_j.y*v_k.x - v_j.x*v_k.y)

        So we can write:
          2(v_j.y - v_k.y) c_x + 2(v_k.x - v_j.x) c_y = (v_j.y - v_k.y)*v_i.x + (v_k.x - v_j.x)*v_i.y + (v_j.y*v_k.x - v_j.x*v_k.y)

        This is linear in c.

    Therefore, we can generate equations of the form:
        A * c_x + B * c_y = C

    from both Type 2 and Type 3.

 3. We then consider every pair of equations (from Type2 and Type3) to solve for c. We skip if the determinant is near zero.

 4. For each candidate center c (from midpoints and from solving the equations), we:
    a) Form the set S = { v_i for i in range(n) } ∪ { 2c - v_i for i in range(n) }
    b) Compute the convex hull of S.
    c) Check that every original vertex is on the boundary of the convex hull (either as a vertex of the hull or on an edge).
    d) If valid, compute the area of the convex hull.

 5. We take the minimum area over all valid candidate centers.

 6. If we found at least one valid center, output the minimum area; else output -1.

 Implementation details:
   - We need a convex hull function (using Andrew's monotone chain or Graham scan) that returns the hull as a list of points (in counter-clockwise order?).
   - We need a function to check if a point is on the boundary of the convex hull (i.e., either it is a vertex of the hull, or it lies on an edge of the hull).

 Note: The problem says the relative error must be within 1e-9.

 However, note: the sample input #3 has a large area and we must output with 15 decimal digits.

 Let's code accordingly.

 Important: The set S might have duplicates? But we use a set to avoid duplicates.

 Steps in code:

   Step 1: Check if n is even and the polygon is centrally symmetric.

   Step 2: Generate candidate centers from midpoints of every pair.

   Step 3: Generate equations from Type2 and Type3. Then solve every two distinct equations to get candidate centers.

   Step 4: For each candidate center, build S, compute the convex hull, and check that every original vertex is on the boundary.

   Step 5: Compute the area of the convex hull and track the minimum.

   Step 6: Output.

 However, note: the problem constraints (n<=30) so generating O(n^3) equations and then O(n^4) candidate centers (by pairing equations) is acceptable (since n<=30, equations are O(n^3) and then pairs of equations would be O((n^3)^2) which is 30^6 = 72900000, which is too many). But note: we are generating equations for Type2 and Type3:

    Type2: for i, j, k: n^3, which is 30^3 = 27000.
    Type3: similarly, 27000.

    Then the total equations is about 54000. Then the pairs would be about 54000 * 54000 = 2.9e9, which is too many.

 We must avoid generating all pairs of equations.

 Alternative: We can generate candidate centers only from the midpoints and from the equations that we generate, but without solving every pair? 

 But note: the problem analysis says: "solve any two such equations yields a candidate c". However, we cannot do O(m^2) for m equations (m ~ 54000) because 5.4e4^2 is about 3e9, which is acceptable in Pyton? Actually, worst-case 3e9 iterations in Python is too slow (4 seconds?).

 We must optimize:

   Instead, we can avoid generating duplicate equations? Actually, the equations are linear, and we can store the equation as (A, B, C) and then use a set of equations? But note: different equations might be linearly dependent but we don't care? Actually, we only need to solve independent ones? But the problem says "any two", so we do.

   However, 30^3 is 27000, so Type2 and Type3 together are 54000 equations. Then the pairs are 54000 * 54000 = 2.9e9, which is too many in Python.

 We need to reduce:

   Actually, the problem says: "each condition provides a linear equation in c, and solving any two such equations yields a candidate c". But note: we don't need to solve every pair. We can use the midpoints and then also the equations from one equation and the midpoint? Actually, the problem does not specify.

   Alternatively, note that the center c must satisfy that for every pair (i, j) the symmetric condition: the symmetric point of i must be j if the center is the midpoint (but that is the first case). The other equations are for the cases when the symmetric point is not necessarily one of the original vertices.

   Insight: The center c must be such that the symmetric point of each vertex must lie on the convex hull? Not necessarily, but the convex hull we form is of the original and symmetric points.

   However, the problem states: the region must contain all n vertices on the boundary.

   We can also note: the center c must be the center of symmetry. Therefore, the center c must be the midpoint of every pair (v_i, s_i) and (v_j, s_j) for any two points? Actually, it is the midpoint of v_i and its symmetric point s_i by definition.

   But the symmetric point of v_i is 2c - v_i. Therefore, the midpoint of v_i and 2c - v_i is c.

   Therefore, the center c must be the midpoint of v_i and s_i for every i. However, we don't know s_i.

   But note: the convex hull must contain the symmetric points. The boundary condition for the original vertex v_i: it must be on the boundary. The symmetric point of v_i must also be on the boundary? Not necessarily: the problem requires the region to be symmetric, so if v_i is on the boundary then so is 2c - v_i.

   How about generating candidate centers only from the midpoints? That is, we only use the midpoints of pairs of original vertices? 

   But consider: the symmetric point of a vertex might not be an original vertex. Therefore, the center c might not be the midpoint of two original vertices. However, the center c is the midpoint of v_i and its symmetric point (which is in the set S). So if we require that the symmetric point of v_i is also on the convex hull (which it must be, because the region is symmetric and convex) then the convex hull must have an edge that connects two points: one from the original and one from the symmetric? Not necessarily: it could connect two symmetric points or two original points.

   Actually, the convex hull is formed by points from the original and symmetric sets.

   Therefore, the center c must be the midpoint of two points that are in the convex hull. But these two points could be:
        (a) two original vertices -> then c is a midpoint of two original vertices (which we are already generating).
        (b) one original and one symmetric: then c = (v_i + s_j)/2, but note that s_j = 2c - v_j, so we have:
                c = (v_i + (2c - v_j)) / 2
                => 2c = v_i + 2c - v_j
                => v_i = v_j   -> which is impossible (distinct vertices? but the problem says no three collinear, but vertices can be distinct? but then we get a contradiction).

        (c) two symmetric points: then c = (s_i + s_j)/2 = ( (2c - v_i) + (2c - v_j) ) / 2 = (4c - v_i - v_j)/2 = 2c - (v_i+v_j)/2.
            => 2c = 2c - (v_i+v_j)/2   => (v_i+v_j)/2 = 0 -> which is not necessarily true.

        Actually, from (c): 
            c = 2c - (v_i+v_j)/2
            => c = (v_i+v_j)/2.

        So the center is the midpoint of v_i and v_j. So again, we get that c must be the midpoint of two original vertices.

   Therefore, we only need the midpoints? 

   But wait: the problem analysis says to also consider equations from collinearity. Why? 

   Consider: the symmetric point of a vertex might lie on the line connecting two original vertices. Then we get an equation. And similarly for the other type.

   However, note: the center c must be the midpoint of two points in the convex hull. And we argued that the only possibility is that it is the midpoint of two original vertices? 

   But the convex hull may include symmetric points that are not original. Then the midpoint of an original vertex and a symmetric point (that is not an original) would lead to a contradiction? 

   Actually, from above: if we have an original vertex v_i and a symmetric point s_j (which is 2c - v_j) then we have:
        c = (v_i + s_j) / 2 = (v_i + 2c - v_j) / 2
        => 2c = v_i + 2c - v_j
        => v_i = v_j -> which implies i=j. Then s_j = s_i = 2c - v_i, and then the midpoint of v_i and s_i is c. So that is consistent.

   Therefore, the center c is the midpoint of v_i and s_i for every i. But that does not give new centers: because we don't know the symmetric points.

   However, note: the convex hull might have edges that are not connecting v_i to s_i? 

   But the argument above for the center being the midpoint of two original vertices: we see that if we take two symmetric points we get c = (v_i+v_j)/2. And if we take an original and a symmetric point (which is not the symmetric of that original) we get a contradiction? Actually, we got v_i = v_j, which is not true. But if we take an original v_i and its own symmetric s_i, then we get:
        c = (v_i + s_i)/2 = (v_i + (2c - v_i))/2 = (2c)/2 = c -> which is always true.

   So the only midpoints that we can get from the convex hull that give the center c are:
        - the midpoint of v_i and s_i (which is c) for any i -> but that doesn't give new information because we don't know s_i.
        - the midpoint of two original vertices? which gives c = (v_i+v_j)/2 -> we are generating these.
        - the midpoint of two symmetric points: which gives c = (s_i+s_j)/2 = ( (2c - v_i) + (2c - v_j) ) / 2 = (4c - v_i - v_j)/2 = 2c - (v_i+v_j)/2 -> which implies (v_i+v_j)/2 = c -> same as above.

   Therefore, the center c must be the midpoint of two original vertices? 

   But wait: what if the convex hull has an edge between an original vertex and a symmetric point (of a different vertex)? 
        Then the midpoint of that edge is: (v_i + s_j)/2 = (v_i + 2c - v_j)/2 = (v_i - v_j)/2 + c.
        This must be equal to c? Only if v_i = v_j -> which is not true.

   Therefore, the center c is not the midpoint of such an edge? 

   Actually, the center of symmetry does not have to be the midpoint of an edge of the convex hull. It is the center of the entire figure. The convex hull is symmetric about c, but the edges might not be symmetric to each other? 

   However, the problem says: the region is symmetric about c. Therefore, for every edge from A to B, there is a symmetric edge from s_A to s_B. And the midpoint of the entire edge? Not necessarily c.

   Therefore, our previous argument that the center c must be the midpoint of two points in the convex hull does not hold? 

   Actually, the center c does not have to be a point in the convex hull. It can be an interior point.

   So we must rely on the equations from collinearity.

   Given the time, we must generate the equations and then solve pairs. But 54000 equations lead to 54000^2 pairs which is about 2.9e9, which is too slow in Python.

   We must optimize:

        We note that many equations might be duplicates? We can store equations as (A, B, C) and use a set? But the equations are floating point and we have to be cautious.

        Alternatively, we can avoid generating duplicate equations by normalizing the equation: multiply by a factor to make the coefficients integers? But the vertices are integers, so the coefficients A, B, C are integers? 

        Actually, the input coordinates are integers. Therefore, we can represent the equation as integers? 

        For Type2: 
            A = -2*(v_j.y - v_i.y)   -> integer
            B =  2*(v_j.x - v_i.x)   -> integer
            C = (v_j.x - v_i.x)*(v_i.y + v_k.y) - (v_j.y - v_i.y)*(v_i.x + v_k.x) -> integer

        Similarly, Type3: 
            A = 2*(v_j.y - v_k.y)   -> integer
            B = 2*(v_k.x - v_j.x)   -> integer
            C = (v_j.y - v_k.y)*v_i.x + (v_k.x - v_j.x)*v_i.y + (v_j.y*v_k.x - v_j.x*v_k.y) -> integer

        So we can store equations as a tuple (A, B, C) and use a set? But note: we might have duplicates.

        Then the number of distinct equations might be reduced.

        But worst-case, we have 54000 equations, and then we have to solve each pair? 54000 distinct equations -> 54000*(54000-1)/2 ~ 1.4e9 pairs. Still too slow.

   Alternative approach:

        We note that the center c must satisfy for every triple (i, j, k) that we used in Type2, and similarly for Type3, but we don't need to solve every pair. 

        Actually, the problem says: "each condition provides a linear equation in c, and solving any two such equations yields a candidate c". But we can take two equations that are independent? 

        However, we are not sure which two. We must try every pair? 

   Given the constraints (n<=30) but the equations are O(n^3) which is 27000, and 27000^2 is 729e6 which is acceptable in C++ but in Python it might be borderline (4 seconds) if we do 729e6 iterations? 

   But note: we have both Type2 and Type3: total equations about 2 * (n^3) = 54000, and 54000^2 = 2.9e9, which is too many.

   We must reduce the number of equations. 

   Observation: 
        We are generating equations for every triple (i, j, k). But note that if the three points are collinear, then the equation is trivial? But the problem states the polygon is convex and no three vertices collinear. So the equation is non-trivial? 

        However, we are generating equations for every triple, but many equations are linearly dependent? 

        But we don't care: we are going to solve every distinct pair? 

   We must avoid generating duplicate equations? 

        We can use a set for equations (represented as normalized integers). How to normalize?

        We can represent the equation: A*cx + B*cy = C.

        We can normalize by the gcd? But gcd for three numbers? And we are in integers.

        Normalization: 
          Let g = gcd(A, B, C) [taking absolute value and considering signs]. But note: if A, B, C are all zero, then skip? But that shouldn't happen.

        For an equation, we can represent it as a tuple (A//g, B//g, C//g) but note: if A, B, C are zero? 

        Actually, A and B might be zero? 

        For Type2: 
            A = -2*(v_j.y - v_i.y)
            B =  2*(v_j.x - v_i.x)
            If (v_j.y - v_i.y) and (v_j.x - v_i.x) are both zero? then i=j? but i and j are distinct? -> so skip i=j? Actually, we skip i=j? In our loops we have i and j distinct? 

        Similarly, for Type3: 
            A = 2*(v_j.y - v_k.y)
            B = 2*(v_k.x - v_j.x)
            If both zero? then v_j = v_k -> skip j=k? but we have j and k distinct? Actually, we don't require j and k distinct? But if j=k, then we get A=B=0. Then the equation becomes 0 = C. 
            Then we must check: 
                C = v_i.x*(v_j.y - v_k.y) + v_i.y*(v_k.x - v_j.x) + (v_j.y*v_k.x - v_j.x*v_k.y)
                = 0 + 0 + (v_j.y*v_j.x - v_j.x*v_j.y) = 0.
            So it becomes 0=0 -> always true. So we skip when j==k? 

        Therefore, we can skip when j==k in Type3 and when i==j in Type2? Actually, in our loops we skip i=j? 

        In Type2: we have for i, j, k: we skip i=j? Actually, we have a loop: for i in n, for j in n (if i != j) then for k in n. Similarly for Type3.

        Then we have non-zero A and B? Not necessarily: the vector (v_j - v_i) might be horizontal? then A=0? but then the equation becomes: 
            -2*(v_j.y - v_i.y) * cx + ... 
            if the vector is horizontal: v_j.y = v_i.y -> then A=0, and then the equation becomes: 
                B * cy = C   [with B = 2*(v_j.x - v_i.x) which is non-zero because i != j and the polygon is convex? and no three collinear? so the vector is non-zero]

        So we can have equations that are vertical? 

        Therefore, we can represent each equation as a normalized integer tuple? 

        Steps for normalization:
          Let g = gcd(gcd(|A|,|B|), |C|) if at least one of A, B, C is non-zero. If g>0, then we divide by g. Also, we want the sign to be consistent: we can require the first non-zero among (A, B, C) to be positive.

        But note: if A=0 and B=0, then we skip? because then the equation is 0=C -> if C=0 then it's always true (skip) and if C!=0 then no solution (skip). 

        However, we have already skipped when the vector (v_j - v_i) is zero? and similarly for Type3? 

        So we can normalize and then store in a set. Then the number of distinct equations is reduced.

        How many distinct equations? worst-case still O(n^3) = 27000? but then the set will be about the same? 

        Then we have m = |set|, which is up to 54000? 

        Then the pairs: m*(m-1)/2 ~ 1.4e9 for m=54000 -> still too slow.

   Another idea: we can use the midpoints and then also use the equations to get candidate centers one by one? 

        Actually, the problem analysis says: we also generate candidate centers from solving two equations. But we can also solve one equation together with the midpoints? 

        However, the midpoints are already generated. 

        How about: for each equation, we can solve it with a midpoint? 

        But the midpoint gives a candidate center? not an equation? 

        Alternatively, we can express the midpoint as a candidate and then check if it satisfies the equation? but that doesn't give a new candidate.

        Actually, the midpoints are already in the candidate set.

   Given the complexity, and the fact that n is only 30, we can hope that the actual number of distinct equations is not 54000? 

        For Type2: 
          We have: for fixed i, j, k: 
            Equation: -2*(v_j.y - v_i.y) * cx + 2*(v_j.x - v_i.x) * cy = (v_j.x - v_i.x)*(v_i.y + v_k.y) - (v_j.y - v_i.y)*(v_i.x + v_k.x)

          But note: if we fix i and j, then the equation for different k are linear in k? 

        Actually, the equation for fixed i,j is:
            A = -2*(v_j.y - v_i.y)
            B =  2*(v_j.x - v_i.x)
            C = (v_j.x - v_i.x)*(v_i.y + v_k.y) - (v_j.y - v_i.y)*(v_i.x + v_k.x)

          = (v_j.x - v_i.x)*v_i.y + (v_j.x - v_i.x)*v_k.y - (v_j.y - v_i.y)*v_i.x - (v_j.y - v_i.y)*v_k.x

          = [ (v_j.x - v_i.x)*v_i.y - (v_j.y - v_i.y)*v_i.x ] + [ (v_j.x - v_i.x)*v_k.y - (v_j.y - v_i.y)*v_k.x ]

          = constant (for fixed i,j) + (v_j.x - v_i.x)*v_k.y - (v_j.y - v_i.y)*v_k.x

        So for fixed i,j, the equation is linear in k. Therefore, the equations for a fixed i,j and varying k are linearly independent? 

        But we are going to get many equations? 

   However, the problem constraints say n<=30, so 30^3 = 27000 is acceptable to generate equations, but the pairing of equations (which is O(m^2)) is 27000^2 = 729e6, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python? 

   We note: 729e6 iterations in Python might be borderline in PyPy/C++ but in Python we have 4 seconds? 

   Actually, 729e6 iterations in Python is about 10 seconds? (assuming 1e8 per second, so 7 seconds) -> too slow.

   Therefore, we must avoid generating all equations? 

   Alternative: we can generate candidate centers from the midpoints and then from the equations by solving only pairs that come from different (i,j) for Type2? 

   Actually, the problem analysis says: we also consider equations from Type3. 

   We must reduce the number of equations: 

        We note that an equation from Type2: for a fixed i,j and two different k1 and k2, we get two equations that are the same? 

        Actually, the equation for fixed i,j and k is unique? 

        We can try to avoid duplicates by storing the equation in normalized form? 

        Normalization: 
          We have equation: A*cx + B*cy = C.
          We can factor out the gcd of (A, B, C) and then represent as a tuple (A//g, B//g, C//g) and store in a set.

        Then the number of distinct equations is reduced? 

        How much? The coefficients are integers and the absolute values are bounded (because coordinates <=1000, so A, B, C are bounded by about 10^6). The gcd normalization might help? 

        But worst-case, we have 54000 distinct equations? 

        Then we have to solve every distinct pair: 54000^2/2 = 1.4e9, which is too slow in Python.

   Given the time constraints and the fact that n<=30, we note that the midpoints are only O(n^2) = 900. And we also need to consider the equations? 

   But the problem analysis says: we generate candidate centers from midpoints and from solving two equations. 

   However, we have an alternative: the center c must be such that the set S = {v_i} ∪ {2c - v_i} must have the property that the convex hull of S has all the original vertices on the boundary. 

   And we are going to check every candidate center. 

   How many candidate centers? 
        Midpoints: O(n^2) = 900.
        Equations: we have m equations, and then we solve every pair: O(m^2) which is 54000^2 = 2.9e9 -> too many.

   But note: we only need to solve pairs that are independent and yield a solution? 

   Alternatively, we can also note: the center c is uniquely determined by two conditions. Therefore, we can use two different triples to get two equations and then solve? 

   But how many candidate centers do we get from equations? It could be O(m^2) which is 2.9e9, which is too many.

   Revised plan:

        We generate candidate centers from:
          (a) midpoints: 900 candidates.
          (b) for each equation from Type2 and Type3, we can solve it with a midpoint? -> 900 * 54000 = 48.6e6 which is acceptable? 

        But wait: the midpoint gives a specific point, not an equation. 

        How about: for each equation, we can express one variable in terms of the other? and then plug into the midpoint? 

        Actually, we are not matching equations and midpoints. 

        How about: we also generate equations from the midpoints? 

        Actually, we can consider: the center c must be the midpoint of v_i and v_j for some i,j? -> then we have c = (v_i+v_j)/2. 

        Then for an equation from Type2: 
            A * cx + B * cy = C
            we can plug c = (v_i+v_j)/2 and check if it satisfies? -> that doesn't yield a new candidate.

        Alternatively, we can generate candidate centers from one equation and one midpoint? 

        We have one equation: A1*cx + B1*cy = C1.
        And we have a midpoint: c0 = (x0, y0). This is not an equation.

        How can we combine? 

        Another idea: we can generate candidate centers from one equation and one other equation that is from a different triple? -> that is the pairing we need. But that is O(m^2) and m=54000 -> 2.9e9.

        Given the time, we must optimize the equation solving: we note that the equations are linear and the solution is:

          det = A1*B2 - A2*B1
          if abs(det) < eps: skip
          else:
              cx = (C1*B2 - C2*B1) / det
              cy = (A1*C2 - A2*C1) / det

        This per pair is a few operations. But 2.9e9 pairs might be borderline in C++ (about 3 seconds) but in Python it will be too slow.

   Therefore, we decide to generate only:

        candidates from midpoints: O(n^2) = 900.

        candidates from equations that we generate by taking only a limited number of equations? 

        For example, we can take for each pair (i,j) one equation (by fixing k=0)? -> then we have O(n^2) equations. Then the pairs of equations: O((n^2)^2) = O(n^4) = 30^4 = 810000, which is acceptable.

        But which k to choose? 

        Alternatively, we can take for each pair (i,j) one equation for a fixed k (say k=0) and then one equation for a fixed k (k=1), and then solve these two for the same (i,j) -> no, we need two independent equations.

        Or: for each pair (i,j) and for each pair of distinct k1, k2, we get two equations? then we solve them? -> per pair (i,j) we have O(n^2) equations? and then we solve pairs of equations for the same (i,j) -> which is O(n^4) per (i,j) and then overall O(n^6) = 30^6 = 729e6, which is borderline in C++ but in Python we hope that n is 30 -> 729e6 iterations might be 729e6 * 10 operations = 7.29e9 operations -> too slow.

   Given the complexity, and the fact that the sample inputs are small, we hope that the actual number of distinct equations (after normalization) is not too large? 

   We will generate all equations (both Type2 and Type3) and store them in a set of normalized integer tuples. How to normalize:

        For an equation: A*cx + B*cy = C, we do:

          g = gcd(gcd(|A|,|B|), |C|)
          if g==0: skip (but our equations should not have g=0 because then A=B=C=0, which we skip)
          else: 
             A, B, C = A//g, B//g, C//g
             Then we also make the first non-zero among A, B, C positive? 

        Then we have a set of equations.

        The size of the set might be reduced.

   How much reduction? It is data-dependent. In the worst-case, if all equations are distinct, we have 54000 equations.

   Then we solve every pair of equations in the set: m * (m-1) / 2. For m=54000, this is 1.4e9 -> too slow.

   We need a better method.

   Insight: the center c must be such that the set S = {v_i} and {2c - v_i} must yield a convex hull that has the original vertices on the boundary. This condition is very restrictive. In fact, the only candidate centers we need are the midpoints and the ones that come from intersecting two lines that are defined by the conditions that the symmetric point of a vertex must lie on a line of two other vertices. 

   And these conditions might be satisfied by very few candidate centers. 

   Therefore, we might avoid generating all equations and then pairing, and instead use a different method.

   Given the time constraints, and the fact that n is only 30, we decide to do:

        candidate_centers = set()

        # midpoints of every pair of vertices
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                if i == j: 
                    continue
                c = ((vertices[i][0] + vertices[j][0])/2, (vertices[i][1] + vertices[j][1])/2)
                candidate_centers.add(c)

        # Also, for each pair of conditions (one from Type2 and one from Type2, or one from Type2 and one from Type3, etc.) we solve, but we do it only for a limited set of conditions that are likely to be independent and meaningful.

        # Instead, we can generate equations in a list, and then only try to solve for pairs of equations that are not the same and not multiples, and hope that the total distinct equations is not too large.

        # But worst-case 54000 equations -> 1.4e9 pairs is too many.

   We decide to hope that the normalization by gcd will reduce the number of distinct equations significantly. In practice, the coordinates are up to 1000, so the coefficients are bounded by about 4000 (since 2*(1000) is 2000, and then multiplied by 1000 -> 2e6, and gcd of numbers up to 2e6 might reduce the number of distinct representations.

   But worst-case distinct equations might be around 54000.

   We must run in time: 4 seconds in Python for 1.4e9 iterations might be borderline on PyPy/C++ but in Python it is likely too slow.

   Alternative: use only a random sample of equations? not safe.

   Given the low n (n<=30) and that 30^3=27000, and that 27000^2=729e6 which might be acceptable in C++ but in Python we need to optimize with PyPy or hope that the constant factors are low? 

   But the sample inputs might be small.

   However, the problem says: time limit 4.0s.

   We must try to reduce the number of equations:

        We note that many equations might be duplicates. Let's use a set for equations (normalized).

        How to normalize for floating point? We are in integers, so we can do integer gcd.

        Steps for one equation (A, B, C) in integers:

          if A==0 and B==0:
             if C==0: then the equation is always true -> skip.
             else: no solution, skip.
          else:
             g = gcd(gcd(abs(A), abs(B)), abs(C)) if C!=0, or gcd(abs(A),abs(B)) if C==0.
             But if C==0, then g = gcd(abs(A), abs(B)).

          Then divide A, B, C by g.

          Then we want a canonical representation: we can require:
             if A < 0: then multiply by -1.
             if A==0 and B<0: then multiply by -1.
             if A==0 and B==0 and C<0: then multiply by -1.  [but we skip if A=B=0]

          But note: if A==0 and B>0, then we leave as is.

        Then store as (A, B, C).

   We then generate:
        equations = set()

        for Type2 in (i, j, k) with i != j and k any:
            A = -2*(y_j - y_i)
            B = 2*(x_j - x_i)
            C = (x_j - x_i)*(y_i + y_k) - (y_j - y_i)*(x_i + x_k)

            But wait: our derivation earlier was:
                C = (x_j - x_i)*(y_i+y_k) - (y_j - y_i)*(x_i+x_k)
            But also note: we had an alternative expansion: 
                = (x_j - x_i)*y_i + (x_j - x_i)*y_k - (y_j - y_i)*x_i - (y_j - y_i)*x_k

            However, we'll compute with integers.

        Similarly for Type3: 
            A = 2*(y_j - y_k)
            B = 2*(x_k - x_j)
            C = (y_j - y_k)*x_i + (x_k - x_j)*y_i + (y_j*x_k - x_j*y_k)

        Then normalize and add to the set.

   The number of distinct equations might be reduced. Let's hope in practice it is reduced to O(n^2) or something.

   Then if the set has size M, the number of pairs is M*(M-1)//2. We hope M is small.

   If M is up to 1000, then 1e6 pairs, which is acceptable.

   But worst-case M can be 54000 -> 1.4e9 pairs.

   We will try and hope that the normalization reduces duplicates.

   If not, we might need to skip this part for large M and only use the midpoints? but then we might miss some centers.

   Given the sample inputs, we hope that the actual number of distinct equations is not huge.

   We will implement the gcd normalization and hope for the best.

   Steps for gcd:

        def gcd(a, b): # for nonnegative a and b
            if b==0: return a
            return gcd(b, a % b)

        Then for three numbers: gcd(a, gcd(b, c))

   Then we generate candidate centers from:
        candidate_centers (from midpoints) and also from every pair of equations in the set.

   Then for each candidate center, we do the convex hull and boundary check.

   The convex hull for 2*n points (n<=30, so 60 points) is O(60*log(60)) per candidate.

   The number of candidate centers: 
        midpoints: at most 900.
        from equations: at most M*(M-1)//2, which we hope is not too large.

   So the overall complexity is (900 + M*(M-1)/2) * (60*log(60)) 

   If M is 1000, then M*(M-1)/2 ~ 500000, so total candidates = 900 + 500000 = 500900, and then 500900 * 60*log2(60) ~ 500900 * 60*6 = 500900*360 ~ 180e6, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python might be borderline (4 seconds).

   But if M is 54000, then M*(M-1)/2 ~ 1.4e9, which is too many.

   Therefore, we will set a limit: if the set of equations has more than 1000 distinct equations, then we skip the equation pairing and hope that the midpoints cover the solution? 

   Or: if the set has more than 1000, we use only a sample? 

   Given the complexity, we will do:

        Generate distinct equations by normalization.

        If the number of distinct equations is <= 1000, then we solve every pair.

        Otherwise, we skip the equations and only use the midpoints.

   This is a heuristic. But the sample inputs might be such that the number of distinct equations is small.

   Let's test with sample input #1: 
        4
        0 0
        10 0
        8 9
        4 9

        n=4, so equations: Type2: 4*4*4 = 64? but we skip i=j, so 4*3*4 = 48.
                 Type3: 4*4*4 = 64, skip j=k? then 4*4*3 = 48? total 96.

        Then after normalization, how many distinct? We hope many duplicates.

   We will hope the normalization reduces to O(n^2)=16.

   Implement and test on sample input #1.

   However, due to time, we decide to trust the normalization and set a limit of 1000.

   We will also avoid adding duplicate equations by the normalization.

   Summary of the plan:

        Step 1: Check if the polygon is centrally symmetric.

        Step 2: Generate candidate centers from midpoints.

        Step 3: Generate equations from Type2 and Type3, and store in a set of normalized equations (as integer tuples).

        Step 4: If the size of the set <= 1000, then for every pair of equations in the set, if the determinant is not zero, solve for c and add to candidate_centers.

        Step 5: For each candidate center in candidate_centers, build the set S = {v_i} ∪ {2c - v_i} and compute its convex hull.

        Step 6: Check that every original vertex is on the boundary of the convex hull.

        Step 7: Compute the area of the convex hull and track the minimum.

        Step 8: If we found at least one valid candidate, output the minimum area; else output -1.

   We must be cautious: 
        - When solving the two equations, we get floating point? but our equations are integers, so we get rational numbers. But we do floating point division? 

        However, the coordinates of the center c might be fractional. We will use float? but then we have precision issues.

        Alternatively, we can use fractions.Fraction? but then the convex hull in floats later? 

        Given the coordinates of the original vertices are integers, and the center c is the solution of two integer equations, the center c will be rational. 

        But we will use float to represent c? and then compute symmetric points in float? 

        And then check the convex hull and on-boundary in float? 

        We must be cautious with precision.

        But the problem says: relative error 1e-9.

        The convex hull for 60 points with coordinates up to 2000? we can use float and hope.

   Let's code accordingly.

   We will write:

        convex_hull: using Andrew's algorithm (or the one we have in the sample) that returns the hull.

        is_point_on_segment: to check if a point is on an edge.

   We also note: the convex hull function should avoid duplicates? we use a set.

   We also note: the convex hull function should be robust? 

   We will reuse the convex_hull_area function from the sample code? 

   But we also need the hull as a list of points to check boundary membership.

   We will write a function to compute the convex hull and return the hull polygon.

   Steps for convex hull:

        Sort the points lexicographically (x then y).
        Build lower hull and upper hull.

   We will also write a helper function: cross(o, a, b) that returns (a-o) × (b-o)

   For boundary check: 
        For each original vertex v, we check:
          if v is in the hull list? (using exact equality? but we have floating point) -> we use a tolerance? 
        else, check if v lies on any edge of the hull (with tolerance 1e-8).

   We must be cautious: the convex hull might have points that are very close? 

   Given the time, we will code accordingly.

   Let's code.

   Note: we must not output -0.0.

   We'll format the output with 15 decimal places.

   Due to the complexity and potential for large candidate centers from equations (if the set is large), we set a limit (1000) for the equation set size for pairing.

   Let's hope the sample inputs have a small set of distinct equations.

   We will also avoid duplicate candidate centers by using a set (with tolerance? but we use a set of tuples (cx, cy) rounded to 10 decimal places? 

   But the candidate centers from midpoints and from equations might be the same? we use a set of tuples (cx, cy) without rounding? 

   However, floating point precision: we might have the same center from different sources. We will use a set and consider (x, y) as a tuple of floats. But then we might have duplicates. We can use a set of tuples (x, y) rounded to 10 decimals? or use an absolute tolerance.

   Alternatively, we can use a dictionary keyed by (round(cx, 10), round(cy,10))? 

   But then two centers that are very close might be considered distinct. 

   Given the problem constraints (integer coordinates) and the center is rational, we can use a set and consider (cx, cy) as the exact float. But then we might have duplicates from different sources.

   We will do:

        candidate_set = set()

        for midpoint in midpoints:
            # represent as (x, y)
            candidate_set.add( (midpoint[0], midpoint[1]) )

        for each pair of equations that yields a center c = (cx, cy):
            candidate_set.add( (cx, cy) )

        But the center from equations might be the same as a midpoint? then we avoid duplicate work.

   However, we use a set so duplicates are avoided.

   But floating point from equation solving might not match exactly the midpoint? 

   We can round to the nearest 1e-10? 

   But the coordinates of the midpoints are multiples of 0.5? and the centers from equations are rational numbers with denominator dividing the determinant? 

   We will use: 
        candidate_set = set()
        and then when adding a candidate from equations, we do:
            cx, cy = ... (floats)
            # round to 10 decimal places? 
            key = (round(cx, 10), round(cy, 10))
            candidate_set.add(key)

        Similarly for midpoints: 
            c = (x, y) -> key = (round(x,10), round(y,10))

   This will avoid duplicates due to floating point.

   But note: the midpoint might be (x, y) and the equation might yield (x, y) but due to floating point error they are slightly different.

   So rounding is a good idea.

   We'll do that.

   Let's code accordingly.

   Due to the complexity and potential for large number of candidates from equations, we set a limit on the equation set size (<=1000) for pairing.

   Code structure:

        import math

        def gcd(a, b):
            a = abs(a); b = abs(b)
            while b:
                a, b = b, a % b
            return a

        # Step 1: Check for central symmetry (if n even)
        # Step 2: Generate candidate centers from midpoints.
        # Step 3: Generate equations (Type2 and Type3) and store in a set `eq_set` after normalization.

        # Step 4: Convert the set of equations to a list, say `eq_list`.
        #         If the size of `eq_list` <= 1000:
        #             for i in range(len(eq_list)):
        #                 for j in range(i+1, len(eq_list)):
        #                     A1, B1, C1 = eq_list[i]
        #                     A2, B2, C2 = eq_list[j]
        #                     det = A1*B2 - A2*B1
        #                     if abs(det) < 1e-8: 
        #                         continue
        #                     cx = (C1*B2 - C2*B1) / det
        #                     cy = (A1*C2 - A2*C1) / det
        #                     key = (round(cx,10), round(cy,10))
        #                     candidate_set.add(key)

        # Step 5: For each candidate in candidate_set, do:
        #          S = [all original points and symmetric points: for v in vertices: add v and (2*cx - v[0], 2*cy - v[1])]
        #          Compute convex_hull = convex_hull(S)   [as a list of points in counter-clockwise order? we don't care the order for area, but for boundary check we need the edges]
        #          Check that every vertex in `vertices` is on the boundary of convex_hull.
        #          If valid, compute area = convex_hull_area(convex_hull) and update min_area.

        # Step 6: Output.

   We also note: we might have the same candidate center from midpoints and from equations, but we use a set with rounding to 10 decimals, so we avoid duplicates.

   We must be cautious: the rounding might hide two distinct centers that are very close? but the problem says the minimum area, and the area of the convex hull might be continuous in c? 

   However, we are only asked for the minimum area among the candidates.

   Given the complexity, we hope that the candidate centers we generate are sufficient.

   We now implement the helper functions.

   Note: the convex_hull function and the boundary check function.

   We'll implement:

        def convex_hull(points):
            # returns the convex hull as a list of points in counter-clockwise order? 
            # using Andrew's algorithm

        def is_point_on_segment(a, b, p, tol=1e-8):
            # Check if p is collinear and between a and b.

        Then in the boundary check for a vertex v:
            if v is in the convex hull (with tol 1e-8) -> then it is a vertex -> boundary.
            else, check for every edge (hull[i], hull[i+1]) if v is on that edge (with tol 1e-8).

   However, note: the convex hull function might return points in a list, and we can check membership by comparing coordinates? but with tolerance.

   We'll do:

        def point_eq(a, b, tol=1e-8):
            return abs(a[0]-b[0])<tol and abs(a[1]-b[1])<tol

        Then for v in vertices:
            if any(point_eq(v, p) for p in hull: 
                continue
            else:
                found = False
                for idx in range(len(hull)):
                    a = hull[idx]
                    b = hull[(idx+1) % len(hull)]
                    if is_point_on_segment(a, b, v, tol=1e-8):
                        found = True
                        break
                if not found:
                    skip this candidate center.

   We now code accordingly.

   Due to the length, we hope it runs within time for the given constraints.

   Let's hope the sample inputs work.

   Sample input #1: 4 points -> candidate centers: 
        midpoints: 12 (if we do for i!=j, then 12: because 4 points, 4*3=12 midpoints? but wait: i and j can be the same? we skip i=j -> 12.

        equations: we hope after normalization the set is small.

   We'll run and see.

   However, we are not required to run in the sample input in the code.

   We'll trust the method.

   Let's run sample input #1:

        Input: 
            4
            0 0
            10 0
            8 9
            4 9

        We know the output is 90.0.

        How many candidate centers? 
            midpoints: 12.

        Then equations: Type2: for i,j,k: i in [0,1,2,3], j in [0,1,2,3] (j != i), k in [0,1,2,3] -> 4*3*4 = 48.
                      Type3: similarly, 4*4*3 = 48 (since j != k? we skip j=k) -> total 96 equations.

        Then we normalize and store in a set.

        The distinct equations: ? 

        Then if the distinct equations set has size M, we then solve M*(M-1)/2 pairs.

        Then we add the centers from equations to the candidate_set (after rounding to 10 decimals).

        Then we check each candidate center.

        The valid candidate center should be (5.0, 4.5) ? 

        But note: the sample region is a hexagon? 

        The sample output is 90.0.

        We hope the candidate center (5.0, 4.5) is generated by a midpoint? 
            The midpoint of (0,0) and (10,9) -> (5,4.5) -> yes.

        So it is in the midpoints.

        Therefore, we will find it.

   Sample input #2: 8 points -> output -1.

   We'll do the same.

   We hope the boundary check fails for every candidate center? 

   We now code accordingly.

   Note: The sample input #3 is large and we hope the distinct equations set is small.

   Let's hope.

   We'll implement the gcd for three numbers.

   Note: gcd(0,0) is 0, but then if we have (0,0,0) we skip.

   We'll implement:

        def gcd_three(a, b, c):
            return gcd(gcd(a,b), c)

   But then if any of a,b,c is negative? we take absolute value.

   We'll take absolute value for gcd.

   Steps for normalizing an equation (A, B, C) (integers):

        if A==0 and B==0:
            if C==0: skip (always true)
            else: skip (contradiction)
        else:
            g = gcd_three(abs(A), abs(B), abs(C)) 
            if g==0: # then all zeros? skip
            else:
                A //= g
                B //= g
                C //= g
                # Now adjust the sign: we want the first non-zero of (A, B, C) to be positive.
                if A < 0:
                    A = -A; B = -B; C = -C
                elif A==0:
                    if B < 0:
                        B = -B; C = -C
                # if A==0 and B==0, we skip (but we already skipped above)

        Then the equation is (A, B, C)

   But note: if A==0 and B>0, then we leave as is.

   We then store in a set.

   Now, we code accordingly.

   Due to the complexity, we hope the distinct equations are not too many.

   Let's run sample input #1 and count the distinct equations.

   We'll not print here.

   But if we have time, we can run.

   We'll proceed.

   IMPORTANT: We must also avoid duplicate equations that are the same line. Normalization by gcd and sign will make them the same.

   Let's hope.

   Now, we code.

   Note: the convex hull area function we already have.

   We also note: the convex hull function we write should return the hull in a list (without duplicates) and then we check boundary.

   We'll write the convex hull function that removes duplicates.

   Steps for convex hull (Andrew's algorithm):

        Sort the points: by x then by y.
        Remove duplicates? we have a set.

   We'll do:

        points = list(set(points))   # but we use tolerance? -> but we are in float. 

        But we used a set of points? and then we sorted. However, we have floating point, so we might have duplicates by rounding. 

        We do: 
            points = sorted(set(points), key=lambda p: (p[0], p[1]))
        but set of floating points might not work well.

   We'll do: we use a set by rounding to 10 decimals? 

        points = set()
        for v in vertices:
            points.add( (round(v[0],10), round(v[1],10)) )
        for v in sym:   # sym: 2c - v
            points.add( (round(2*cx - v[0],10), round(2*cy - v[1],10)) )

        Then we form the convex hull of the set of points.

   But note: the convex hull algorithm must be robust to collinear points? but we remove duplicates.

   We'll do:

        # Remove duplicates by a set of rounded points to 10 decimals.
        # But then we lose precision? 

        Alternatively, we can use a tolerance in the convex hull? 

   Given the time, we will use the convex hull algorithm that we provided in the sample code (which uses cross product with tolerance? but we don't have tolerance in cross product).

   We'll use the exact cross product and hope that the points are not collinear? but the problem says the symmetric region must be convex, and we form the convex hull.

   We'll use the standard convex hull algorithm with cross product without tolerance? but then we use integer arithmetic? 

   But we are in floats. 

   We'll use the cross product with a tolerance? 

   We'll modify:

        def cross(o, a, b):
            return (a[0]-o[0])*(b[1]-o[1]) - (a[1]-o[1])*(b[0]-o[0])

        Then in the convex hull, we use:
            while len(lower) >= 2 and cross(lower[-2], lower[-1], p) <= 1e-8:   # but we want to remove non left turns? 
            but the standard uses <=0 for non left turn.

        We do without tolerance? 

   The problem: the points might be very close and the cross product might be near zero.

   We'll use a tolerance in the convex hull? 

        if cross(lower[-2], lower[-1], p) < -1e-8: # then it's a right turn, we keep going left?
        Actually, we want non-left turn: so if cross(...) <= 1e-8, we pop.

   We'll do:

        if cross(...) < 1e-8: # then we pop? 

        But the standard is:

            while ... and cross(o, a, b) <= 0:   # then remove the middle.

        We'll use:

            while len(lower) >= 2 and cross(lower[-2], lower[-1], p) <= 1e-8:
                lower.pop()

        Similarly for upper.

   This will remove points that are collinear? but the problem says no three vertices are collinear, but the symmetric points might be collinear? 

   We do this.

   Due to the complexity, we hope it is robust.

   We now code the entire solution.

   Note: the sample input #3 is large and has fractional centers? 

   We hope it runs within 4 seconds.

   We'll run on the sample inputs.

   Let's hope.

   Note: the area of the convex hull is computed by the shoelace formula.

   We have:

        def compute_convex_hull_area(hull_points):
            # hull_points is a list of points in ccw order? 
            # but our convex_hull function returns in counter-clockwise? 
            # Andrew's returns in counter-clockwise? 
            # Actually, lower is increasing x, upper is decreasing x, so we have to combine: lower[:-1] and upper[:-1] and then it is in counter-clockwise.

        We compute: 
            area = 0
            n = len(hull_points)
            for i in range(n):
                x1, y1 = hull_points[i]
                x2, y2 = hull_points[(i+1)%n]
                area += x1*y2 - x2*y1
            area = abs(area)/2.0
            return area

   But note: our convex_hull function returns the hull in counter-clockwise? 

   We'll assume it does.

   Now, we code.

   Due to the length, we break the code into functions.

   IMPORTANT: We must avoid using the same candidate center multiple times. We use a set of (cx,cy) rounded to 10 decimals.

   Let's code accordingly.

   We'll do:

        candidates = set()

        # Step 1: central symmetry check (if n even)
        if n % 2 == 0:
            # compute candidate center from first and n//2
            c0 = ((vertices[0][0] + vertices[n//2][0]) / 2.0, (vertices[0][1] + vertices[n//2][1]) / 2.0)
            symmetric_ok = True
            for i in range(n):
                j = (i + n//2) % n
                x_sym = 2*c0[0] - vertices[i][0]
                y_sym = 2*c0[1] - vertices[i][1]
                # Check if (x_sym, y_sym) equals vertices[j] within 1e-8?
                if abs(x_sym - vertices[j][0]) > 1e-8 or abs(y_sym - vertices[j][1]) > 1e-8:
                    symmetric_ok = False
                    break
            if symmetric_ok:
                # Compute the area of the original polygon.
                area = 0
                for i in range(n):
                    x1, y1 = vertices[i]
                    x2, y2 = vertices[(i+1) % n]
                    area += x1 * y2 - x2 * y1
                area = abs(area) / 2.0
                print("{:.15f}".format(area))
                return

        # Step 2: midpoints
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                if i == j:
                    continue
                cx = (vertices[i][0] + vertices[j][0]) / 2.0
                cy = (vertices[i][1] + vertices[j][1]) / 2.0
                # round to 10 decimals to avoid floating point duplicates
                key = (round(cx, 10), round(cy, 10))
                candidates.add(key)

        # Step 3: generate equations for Type2 and Type3, and normalize to a set of integer tuples (A, B, C) in canonical form.
        equations_set = set()

   Let's hope.

   We run the sample inputs.

   Sample input #1: expect 90.0
   Sample input #2: expect -1
   Sample input #3: expect 486567.9669655848

   We hope.

   Note: the sample input #3 has n=6, so midpoints: 6*5=30, and equations: 6^3*2 = 432, then after normalization the set of equations might be reduced. Then we solve pairs: if the set has 200 equations, then 20000 pairs, then 30+20000 = 20030 candidates, and each convex hull is 12 points? so 20030 * (12*log12) is acceptable.

   We run.

   However, due to the time, we output the code.

   Note: we use math.gcd.

   We import math.

   Also, note: the equations in Type2 and Type3 are integer, but when we solve we do division by det (which is integer) and we get float? 

   We do.

   Now, we output the code.

   IMPORTANT: The sample input #1 might have the center (5,4.5) and then the convex hull might be a hexagon? and the area 90.0.

   We hope.

   Let's test with sample input #1.

   Due to the complexity, we might not be able to test here.

   We output the code.
