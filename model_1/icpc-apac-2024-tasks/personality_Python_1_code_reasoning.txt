 We are going to follow the editorial guidelines and the C++ solution, but we must be cautious because the constraints are high (n=5000, m=3000) and a double loop in Python might be too slow if we do not optimize the inner loop.

 However, note that k is at most 5, so we can break early when we have found k matches. Also, we break when the remaining positions cannot make the count reach k.

 Steps:
 1. Precompute for each student the list of indices where they have non-dot answers.
 2. We iterate b from 1 to n-1 (0-indexed, so student index from 0 to n-1) and for each b, we iterate a from b-1 down to 0.
 3. For each pair (a, b):
      - If both have less than k non-dot answers, skip.
      - Otherwise, we iterate over the shorter list of non-dot positions. For each position j in that list:
          * Check if the other student also has a non-dot at j and if the characters match.
          * If they do, increment the count.
          * If at any time the count reaches k, we break and output (a+1, b+1) and exit.
      - We also do an early break: if the current count plus the remaining positions in the list we are iterating is less than k, we break the inner loop.

 But note: the remaining positions in the list we are iterating might be the only ones we check? Actually, we are iterating the shorter list. However, we are not considering that the other student might have more non-dot positions? Actually, we are only iterating over the positions that are non-dot for the student whose list we are using. But if we are using the list of student a, then we are checking positions that are non-dot for a, and then we check if b has non-dot at that same position. Similarly for the other way.

 Important: The early termination condition: 
      current_count + (remaining length) < k -> break.

 However, note: the remaining length is the number of positions we have left to check. But if we are iterating the shorter list, then the maximum possible matches we can get is the entire remaining list. So if current_count + (remaining_length) < k, then we break.

 4. If we find no pair, output -1.

 But note: the problem requires the pair with smallest b (then largest a). Our iteration for b from 0 to n-1 (but actually we start at b=1 index 1 to n-1) and for each b we iterate a from b-1 down to 0 (so we start from the largest a for the same b). Therefore, the first pair we find for a fixed b (and we are iterating b from the smallest to largest) and then a from largest to smallest (so the largest a for that b) is the candidate. And we break at the first candidate we find (which is the smallest b and then the largest a for that smallest b) and output.

 However, note: we are iterating b from 0-indexed 1 to n-1. So the first candidate we find is the smallest b (in 1-indexed: the b we are at is the smallest b that has a pair) and the a we found is the largest a (because we are going from b-1 down to 0) for that b.

 But note: the problem says: smallest b, then largest a. So this matches.

 However, note: we must be cautious: if we skip a pair (a1, b) because we break early and then later find a pair (a2, b) with a2 < a1, that would not be a problem because we are iterating a from high to low (so we first check a1 and then a2). Actually, we break as soon as we find a pair for (a, b). And since we iterate a from b-1 down to 0, the first valid a we find is the largest a for that b. So we output that and exit.

 But what if there is a pair (a, b) that we skip because we break early? Actually, our early break is only for the inner loop of the current a: if we are checking a particular a and we break because we cannot get k matches, we skip that a and move to the next. However, we are not skipping the entire b? No, we break the inner loop for that a only? Actually, no: the inner loop is for a fixed pair (a, b). So if we break the inner loop for the current a, we just move to the next a (the next a in the loop for this b).

 However, note: the inner loop is the one that counts the matches for the pair (a,b). So if we break the inner loop (the for-loop over the positions) because we cannot reach k, then we move to the next a. But we don't break the outer a-loop.

 But what if we break the inner loop because we found k? Then we break the inner loop (over positions) and then we output the pair and exit the entire program.

 So the structure is:

   for b in range(1, n):
      for a from b-1 down to 0:
          da = len(non_dot_positions[a])
          db = len(non_dot_positions[b])
          if da < k and db < k: skip this a (continue to next a)

          else:
             count = 0
             if da <= db:
                 iterate over non_dot_positions[a]:
                    for each j in non_dot_positions[a]:
                         if grid[b][j] != '.' and grid[a][j]==grid[b][j]:
                             count++ 
                             if count>=k: break the inner for and then we output and exit.
                         else: 
                             then we check: if count + (remaining positions) < k -> break the inner for (and then move to next a)
             else: similarly for the list of b.

          If we broke the inner loop because we found k, then output and exit.

   If we never found a pair, output -1.

 However, note: the condition for early termination by remaining positions: 
      We are iterating the list of positions. We can precompute the total length of the list we are iterating (say L). Then at each step, the remaining positions is L - (current index) - 1.

 But note: in the inner loop we are using an index variable. We can do:

      L = len(list)   [the shorter list]
      for idx, j in enumerate(list):
          ... 
          if count + (L - idx - 1) < k: break

 However, note: we are at the idx-th element (0-indexed), so the remaining is L - idx - 1.

 But what if we break the inner loop because of this condition? Then we skip the rest of the positions for this pair (a,b) and move to the next a.

 But note: we must be cautious: the condition is only an optimization. Without it, we would still break when we have found k, and if we don't find k we just move on.

 However, the problem constraints: k is at most 5, so we can also avoid the early break condition? Actually, the inner loop might be long (up to 3000) but 3000 * (number of pairs) might be too heavy. We have about 12.5e6 pairs (n*(n-1)/2 ~ 12.5e6) and each inner loop up to 3000 -> 37.5e9 operations worst-case, which is too heavy in Python.

 Therefore, we must use the early termination condition.

 But note: the condition "if da < k and db < k" already skips pairs that cannot possibly have k matches. However, if one student has many non-dot answers and the other has at least k, we still need to check. But k is small (<=5) so we can break quickly when we have found k.

 However, worst-case: if we have to go through the entire list? Then 12.5e6 * 3000 = 37.5e9 operations which is too high in Python.

 Therefore, we must optimize by iterating over the shorter list and also by the early termination condition (if the remaining positions are not enough to get k matches, we break).

 But note: the worst-case where k=5 and the two students have 3000 non-dot answers, but we break after 5 matches? Actually, we break when we have 5 matches. So worst-case we only do 5 * (number of pairs that have at least 5 matches) which is acceptable? But the problem is that we have to check the pairs until we find one that has at least 5 matches.

 However, worst-case there might be no pair that has 5 matches, then we have to check all pairs and for each pair we have to check the entire shorter list? Then worst-case 12.5e6 * 3000 = 37.5e9 operations, which in Python is too slow.

 We need a better approach.

 Alternative approach:

 Since k is small (at most 5), we can do the following:

   For each student, we precompute the set of non-dot positions and the answers.

   For a pair (a, b) to be similar, they must have at least k common positions where both have the same character.

   Instead of iterating over every pair, we can try to index the students by the questions they answered? But note: we have up to 3000 questions.

   Alternatively, we can use the following: 
        We are iterating by b from 1 to n-1 (0-indexed) and for each b, we want to check the previous students (a) from b-1 down to 0.

   How about: for each question j, we can record the students that answered that question and what they answered? But then we have to combine multiple questions? and we need at least k.

   Another idea: since k is small, we can use a randomized hashing? Or we can use the fact that we only need one pair.

   Alternatively, we can use the following: 
        For each student b, we want to know if there exists a previous student a (with a < b) such that the number of questions j where:
            grid[a][j] == grid[b][j] and grid[a][j] != '.' and grid[b][j] != '.'
        is at least k.

   We can precompute for each student a set of (position, character) pairs? Then the condition is: the intersection of the two sets (but only considering the same position and same character) must have at least k.

   But note: the same position might appear in both sets, but we require the same character? So we are counting the positions j that are in both sets and for which the character is the same.

   Actually, we can store for each student the set of non-dot positions and the character at that position. Then the condition for a position j is: if j is in both sets and the character is the same, then it counts.

   However, how to quickly compute the number of such positions for a pair (a,b)? We can do:

        common = 0
        for j in the non-dot positions of student a (or the smaller set):
            if j is also in the set of non-dot positions of b and grid[a][j] == grid[b][j]:
                common += 1
                if common>=k: break

   But this is the same as our original approach.

   How to speed up? We can use a bitset? But we are only counting the matches and k is small.

   Alternatively, we can precompute for each question j and for each character c, which students have c at j? Then we can for each student b, and for each j that b answered, we can look at the character c = grid[b][j] and then the list of previous students a that have the same character at j. Then we can use a global array for each student a, we increment a counter for (a, b) when we see j? But we don't want to iterate over all j for b and then all a that have the same j? That would be O(m * (# of students that have the same character at j)) which might be heavy.

   Instead, we can do:

        We are iterating b from 0 to n-1 (but we want the smallest b? Actually we are iterating b from 0-indexed 1 to n-1). For each b, we want to check the previous students.

        We maintain an array `counts` of length n (for previous students) that counts, for the current b, the number of matching answers so far.

        Then for each question j that student b answered (non-dot), we can:
            c = grid[b][j]
            For each student a (in the set of students that have a non-dot at j and the character c and a < b) we can do:
                counts[a] += 1
                if counts[a] >= k:
                    then we have found a pair: (a, b) -> but note: we are iterating b from small to large, and for a fixed b we are iterating j arbitrarily. We want the largest a? Actually, if we update the counts for all a, then we can after processing j, check: is there an a that has counts[a]>=k? And we want the largest a? So we can do:

                    We can break the j-loop and then search for the largest a (<= b-1) such that counts[a]>=k? 

        However, we are iterating j for student b. We want to break as soon as we have one a that reaches k? But note: we want the largest a for the current b. So we can after updating, check: if we have an a that reached k, then we break and then we choose the largest a that has counts[a]>=k? But we are updating multiple a's. How to track the largest a that has counts>=k? We can have a variable that tracks the maximum a index that has counts[a]>=k? Then after each j, we can check: if we have such a candidate? But we are updating counts for each a.

        Alternatively, we can break the j-loop as soon as we have updated an a to k and that a is the largest possible? Actually, we are iterating j arbitrarily. The largest a might not be updated until the last j.

        We can do: after processing each j, we check: is there an a (from 0 to b-1) that has counts[a]>=k? and then take the maximum a? But that is O(n) per j, and j up to 3000, and n=5000 -> 3000*5000 = 15e6 per b, and b from 1 to 4999 -> 15e6 * 5000 = 75e9 which is too heavy.

   Another idea: we can use a Fenwick tree or segment tree? But k is small and we break early? Actually, we can hope that we break early because k is small? But worst-case we might have to process all j for b.

   Alternatively, we can break the j-loop as soon as we have found at least one a that has counts[a]>=k? Then we break and then we scan from a = b-1 down to 0 to find the first a (largest a) that has counts[a]>=k? Then we output and exit.

        But worst-case, we might break after the first j? Then we have to scan 5000 students for each b? That would be 5000 * 5000 = 25e6, which is acceptable? But worst-case we break at the last j, so we do 3000 * (# of a that share the same j) per b. The worst-case for one j: if all students have the same character at j, then we update all a (b-1) for each j. Then for one b, we do 3000 * (b-1) operations. For b=5000, that is 3000*4999 ~ 15e6 per b, and then for 5000 b's: 15e6 * 5000 = 75e9, which is too heavy.

   Therefore, we need a better method.

   Alternatively, we can use the following: for each student b, we want to know the largest a (a < b) such that the number of matching non-dot answers is at least k. We can do:

        We maintain a global array `ans` for each student a: we don't.

        Instead, we can precompute an array `match_count` of size n (for the current b) that we reset for each b? Then we iterate over the non-dot positions of b. For each non-dot position j and character c = grid[b][j], we want to update all previous students a that have the same character at j. 

        But we can avoid iterating over all a? We can have a 2D array `prev` of size m x 26: for each j and each character c, we store the list of students a (with a < b) that have non-dot at j and character c. Then when we update, we iterate over the list for (j, c). Then we update `match_count[a]` for each a in that list. Then we check: if after updating, `match_count[a]` becomes k, then we mark that a is a candidate? Then we want the largest a that becomes at least k? 

        But note: we are iterating j. We can break early: if after updating a particular j, we have a candidate a that has `match_count[a]>=k`, then we break the j-loop and then find the largest a that has `match_count[a]>=k`? 

        How to update: 
            We have an array `match_count` for the current b, of length n (only for a from 0 to b-1). Initially zeros.

            For each j in non_dot_positions[b]:
                c = grid[b][j]
                for each a in the list L = prev[j][c]:
                    if a < b:  # always true since we haven't added b to the list yet
                        match_count[a] += 1
                        if match_count[a] >= k:
                            candidate_a = max(candidate_a, a)   # but we want the largest a, so we can keep a variable: candidate = max(candidate, a)

                Then we can check: if we have candidate_a (from -1 to something) then after this j, we have at least one candidate. But note: we want to break as soon as we have the candidate? Actually, we cannot break the j loop early because a later j might update a larger a? 

                However, we are iterating j arbitrarily. We want the largest a. So we have to update for all j? 

            Then after all j, we check if candidate_a is set? Then we output (candidate_a+1, b+1) and exit.

        But note: we are iterating j in non_dot_positions[b] (which is at most 3000). For each j, we iterate over the list of a that have (j, c). The total work over all b might be the total number of (a, j) pairs? 

        Specifically, each time we see a student a at position j, we will be iterated over for every b (with b>a) that has the same (j, c). The total work is then the sum over j of (number of pairs (a, b) that share (j, c)). This can be O(n^2) in the worst-case (if one j has all students) and then n=5000 -> 12.5e6 per j, and 3000 j's: 37.5e9, which is too heavy.

   Therefore, we stick to the original method but optimize the inner pair check with early termination.

   How to make the original method faster? 

        We note that k is small (<=5). Therefore, we can break very early in the inner loop if we get k matches. Also, if one student has only 5 non-dot answers, then we only check 5 positions.

        Worst-case scenario: no pair has k matches. Then we have to check every pair (a,b). And for each pair, we have to check min(da, db) positions. The worst-case min(da, db) is 3000. And the total pairs is n*(n-1)/2 ~ 12.5e6. Then the total operations is 12.5e6 * 3000 = 37.5e9, which is too slow in Python.

   Therefore, we need to avoid iterating over the entire shorter list for every pair.

   Alternative idea: precomputation of common positions per pair is too heavy. We can precompute for each question j, and then for each character c, the list of students that have c at j. Then for a fixed b, we can iterate over the non-dot positions j of b, and for each such j, we can get the list of students a (a < b) that have the same character at j. Then we can update a global counter for each a (for the current b). Then we check if any a has reached k? 

        Steps for fixed b:
            Let count = [0]*b   (for a in range(b))
            For each j in non_dot_positions[b]:
                c = grid[b][j]
                For each a in prev_list[j][c] (which is the list of students a (with a < b) that have c at j):
                    count[a] += 1
                    if count[a] >= k:
                         we remember candidate_a = max(candidate_a, a)   # but note: we are iterating j, so we cannot break because we might get a larger a later.

            Then after processing all j, we set candidate_a = the largest a (if any) such that count[a] >= k? We can do:

                candidate = -1
                for a in range(b-1, -1, -1):
                    if count[a] >= k:
                        candidate = a
                        break

            Then if candidate != -1, output (candidate+1, b+1) and exit.

        But the inner loop: for each j, we iterate over the list of a in prev_list[j][c]. The total work for one b is the sum over j (in non_dot_positions[b]) of len(prev_list[j][c]). Then the total over all b is the sum over j, c, and over every student b that has (j,c) and then the list of a (that are < b) that also have (j,c). 

        How to compute the total? For each triple (j, c), let the list of students that have (j,c) be L. Then the total work for this (j,c) is: for each b in L, we add the number of a in L that are < b. This is the same as the number of pairs (a, b) with a < b and both in L. The total over the entire input is the sum over j, c of (|L_{j,c}| choose 2). 

        The worst-case: if for one j, all students have the same character c, then |L_{j,c}| = n, and the pairs is n*(n-1)/2. Then over 3000 j's: 3000 * (n*(n-1)/2) = 3000 * 12.5e6 = 37.5e9, which is too heavy.

   So we must avoid that.

   How about: we do not store the entire list? Instead, we update the list as we go. We can use a dictionary for each j: for each c, we store the list of a that have (j,c) and then when we process b, we get the list and then update the count for each a in the list. But the total work is the same.

   Alternatively, we can store for each j, an array of length 26 that stores the last student index that had that character? That doesn't help because we need all a.

   Or we can store for each j, a list for each character that we only keep the most recent students? But we need to update the counts for all a.

   We need a faster update.

   Idea: for each student b, we want to update the count for every a in the list for (j,c). But we can break early in the update? Actually, we don't care about a that are too small? We want the largest a that gets to k. But we are updating count[a] for each a. Then we have to update all a.

   Alternatively, we can use a Fenwick tree or segment tree for the count array? But then we want to update multiple a's by 1 and then query: is there an a with count[a]>=k? and then we want the largest a? We can do a binary search on the segment tree? But that is O(log n) per query. But we want to do it after each j? Or we can do it at the end of b? Then we do:

        We maintain an array `counts` for a in [0, b-1] for the current b.

        For each j in non_dot_positions[b]:
            c = grid[b][j]
            for a in prev_list[j][c]:
                if a < b:   # we ensure
                    counts[a] += 1

        Then after processing all j, we want to know: what is the largest a in [0, b-1] such that counts[a] >= k? We can traverse from a = b-1 down to 0 and break at the first one that has counts[a]>=k.

        The work per b is the total number of a's in the lists for the non_dot_positions of b. The worst-case total work is the sum over j of (number of pairs (a, b) that share j and the same character). This is the same as the total number of pairs (a,b) that share at least one common j with the same character? Actually, it is the sum over j of (|L_{j,c}| choose 2) for each c, but note: one pair (a,b) may be counted in multiple j's. And the total over j and c might be huge.

   But note: we only care about the total work. And the worst-case is when for every question j and for every student, they have the same character. Then for each j, the list for that character has n students. Then the work for one j is: for b from 0 to n-1, we do: for each b, we iterate over the list of a < b for this j: which is b. So total for one j: sum_{b=0}^{n-1} b = O(n^2). Then for 3000 j's: 3000 * O(n^2) = 3000 * 12.5e6 = 37.5e9, which is too heavy.

   Given the complexity of the problem and the constraints, we might have to hope that the worst-case doesn't happen? Or we use the first method with heavy optimization in C++? But we are in Python.

   Alternatively, we can use the first method but with the following optimization: 

        Only iterate over pairs (a, b) for which both da and db are at least k. Because if one of them has less than k non-dot answers, then they cannot have k matches. So we can skip the pair.

        Precompute for each student the number of non-dot answers. Then for a given b, we only consider a that have non_dot_count[a] >= k.

        Then the number of pairs we consider is: only the students that have at least k non-dot answers. Let T be the number of students with at least k non-dot answers. Then the number of pairs is T*(T-1)/2.

        In worst-case, T = n (5000), so the number of pairs is 12.5e6.

        And for each pair, we hope that the inner loop breaks early? 

        Specifically, we iterate over the shorter list (which is at most min(da, db)). The worst-case min(da, db) is 3000. Then 12.5e6 * 3000 = 37.5e9, which is too heavy in Python.

   Therefore, we must hope that the early termination by count (when we reach k) and by the condition (current_count + remaining_positions < k) will prune most of the cases.

   How effective is the pruning by "current_count + remaining_positions < k"?

        Let r = remaining_positions = L - idx - 1.
        Then if current_count + r < k, we break.

        This condition is very effective when k is small and the current_count is small. For instance, if after half the list we have 0 matches, and k=5, then we break at the first half.

   But worst-case: the last k positions are matches, then we have to iterate the entire list. And if no match at all, we also break at the first time we know we cannot reach k.

   In the worst-case where a pair has exactly k matches and they are at the end of the list, we have to iterate the entire list.

   Given that 12.5e6 * 3000 = 37.5e9, and Python might do 10e6 to 100e6 operations per second, 37.5e9 is 375 seconds in Python.

   We need a better method.

   Another idea: we can represent each student by a set of (j, c) for their non-dot answers. Then we wish to find a pair (a,b) such that the intersection of their sets has at least k elements.

   We can use min-hashing or locality sensitive hashing? But k is small.

   Or, we can use: since k is at most 5, we can for each student a, record all combinations of 5 non-dot positions? But that is C(da, 5) which is too many.

   Alternatively, we can use: for each student a, we can record the set of non-dot positions. Then the condition is: |set_a ∩ set_b| >= k? Actually, no: it's not just the common positions, but also the character must match. So it is the size of the set: { j in set_a ∩ set_b such that grid[a][j]==grid[b][j] }.

   But note: if we define the set for a as the set of (j, grid[a][j]), then the condition is: the intersection of the set for a and the set for b has at least k elements.

   How to compute the size of the intersection of two sets quickly? We can do with hashing the entire set, but then how to compute the size of the intersection without iterating? 

   We can use a bloom filter? Or we can use a bitset? But the set size is up to 3000 and we have 5000 students, so we can store a bitset of 3000 bits? 3000/8 = 375 bytes per student, total 5000*375 = 1.875e6 bytes, which is acceptable. But then the intersection is and-popcount? But 12.5e6 * (375/8)? Actually, 375 bytes is 375*8 = 3000 bits, and we can use integers and then and and then popcount in Pyton with:

        count = 0
        for i in range(len(bits_a)):
            count += bin(bits_a[i] & bits_b[i]).count('1')   -> but this is not efficient.

   Alternatively, we can use one integer per student? But 3000 bits requires multiple integers. We can use bit-level parallelism with 64-bit integers: ceil(3000/64) = 47 integers per student.

   Then for a pair, we do 47 and-operations and then 47 popcounts. Popcount can be done by converting to bin and bin(x).count('1') is slow. We can use:

        count = 0
        for i in range(47):
            count += bin(bits_a[i] & bits_b[i]).count('1')

   But worst-case, 47 * (time for bin and count) per pair. And 12.5e6 * 47 = 587.5e6, which might be acceptable in Pyton in PyPy or in C++ but in Python might be borderline in Pyton (587.5e6 iterations might be 10 seconds?).

   However, we can use the built-in popcount for integers if we use:

        count = 0
        for i in range(47):
            count += (bits_a[i] & bits_b[i]).bit_count()

   But note: Python's int.bit_count() is available in Python 3.10+ and is fast.

   Steps for this approach:

        Let's represent the set of (j, grid[i][j]) for student i by a bitset? But wait: the set is over j. But note: we cannot use j alone because the same j might have different characters. So we need to encode (j, c). But the total number of possible (j, c) is m * 26 = 3000*26 = 78000. We can create a universal set of size 78000? But then the bitset would be 78000 bits, which is 78000/8 = 9750 bytes per student, and 5000 students -> 48.75e6 bytes = 48.75 MB, which is acceptable.

        But then the bitset for a student would be: for each (j, c) in the universal set, bit=1 if the student has c at j.

        However, we only care about the non-dot answers. So for a student i, for each j in non_dot_positions[i], we set the bit for (j, grid[i][j]).

        The intersection size between student a and student b is the number of (j, c) such that both have it, which is the popcount of (bitset_a & bitset_b).

        But note: is that correct? Yes.

        However, the total number of pairs: 12.5e6, and each bitset has 78000 bits -> 78000/8 = 9750 bytes. But to do the & and then popcount for two bitsets of size 9750 bytes, that is 9750 * 8 = 78000 bits, and then popcount? 

        We can do:

            count = 0
            for i in range(num_chunks):
                x = bits_a[i] & bits_b[i]
                count += x.bit_count()

        How many chunks? 78000 // 64 + 1 = 78000 / 64 ≈ 1220 chunks.

        Then per pair: 1220 operations. Total operations: 12.5e6 * 1220 = 15.25e9, which is 15.25 billion, which in Python might be too slow.

   We can use a better encoding? Only for the non-dot positions? But then the bitsets would be sparse. We could use a bloom filter? Or we could use hashing to compute the size of intersection? 

   We can use: store for each student the set of (j, c) as a Python set. Then for a pair, we do:

        common = len(set_a & set_b)

   But the worst-case set size is 3000, and set intersection is O(min(|set_a|,|set_b|)). Then per pair: 3000. Total: 12.5e6 * 3000 = 37.5e9.

   So we are back to the same.

 Given the time constraints, and that k is small, we hope that in practice the early termination in the first method will work. Because for a pair that has at least k matches, we break after k matches (which is at most 5 iterations per pair). For pairs that do not have k matches, we hope that the early termination condition (current_count + (remaining) < k) will trigger early.

   How early? If the shorter list has length L, then in the worst-case (no matches) we break when we have processed enough positions to know we cannot reach k: that is, when we have processed L - k + 1 positions and found 0 matches, then we break. But if L < k, we skip the pair. If L>=k, then we break after L - k + 1 positions. For example, if L=3000 and k=5, we break after 3000-5+1 = 2996 positions, which is almost the whole list.

   Therefore, for pairs that have no match, we do min(da, db) iterations, which is 3000.

   And if there are many such pairs, we do 12.5e6 * 3000 = 37.5e9 iterations.

   We must hope that there is a valid pair early or that the students have very short lists.

   The problem says: time limit 3.0 seconds.

   In C++ 37.5e9 iterations might be borderline (around 37.5 seconds in C++ if each iteration is one cycle, but they are not). In Python, it is definitely too slow.

   Therefore, we must try to reduce the number of pairs we check.

   We can try: only check pairs (a,b) such that the combined non-dot answers of a and b have at least k potential matches. But that is the same as our first skip (if da<k and db<k, skip).

   Another idea: sort the students by the number of non-dot answers in descending order? Then if we are checking b, we only check a that have da >= k. But the number of a with da>=k might be the entire set.

   Given the severity, we might have to use the following in C++ but in Python we must hope that the average min(da,db) is small.

   But note: the worst-case might be designed to fail in Python.

   Sample input 4: 
        "4 12 2
         GOOD.LUCK.IN
         WINNING.ICPC
         ASIA.PACIFIC
         CHAMPIONSHIP"

   Here, m=12, so the non-dot answers for each student are at most 12. And 12.5e6 (pairs) * 12 = 150e6, which is acceptable in Python.

   So if the typical student has few non-dot answers, it will be fast.

   Therefore, we go with the first method, and hope that the average length of the non-dot lists is small.

   Summary of the code:

        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]

        non_dot_positions = []
        for i in range(n):
            positions = []
            for j in range(m):
                if grid[i][j] != '.':
                    positions.append(j)
            non_dot_positions.append(positions)

        # We'll iterate b from 1 to n-1 (0-indexed), and for each b, iterate a from b-1 down to 0.
        for b in range(1, n):
            for a in range(b-1, -1, -1):
                da = len(non_dot_positions[a])
                db = len(non_dot_positions[b])
                if da < k and db < k:
                    continue

                count = 0
                # If we use the list of a or b whichever is shorter.
                if da <= db:
                    # use a's list
                    positions = non_dot_positions[a]
                    L = da
                    for idx, j in enumerate(positions):
                        if grid[b][j] != '.' and grid[a][j] == grid[b][j]:
                            count += 1
                            if count >= k:
                                break
                        # Check if we can break early by the remaining not being enough.
                        if count + (L - 1 - idx) < k:
                            break
                else:
                    # use b's list
                    positions = non_dot_positions[b]
                    L = db
                    for idx, j in enumerate(positions):
                        if grid[a][j] != '.' and grid[a][j] == grid[b][j]:
                            count += 1
                            if count >= k:
                                break
                        if count + (L - 1 - idx) < k:
                            break

                if count >= k:
                    print(a+1, b+1)
                    exit(0)

        print(-1)

   Let's test with the sample inputs.

   Sample 1: 
        n=3, m=3, k=2, grid = ["BBC", "..C", ".BC"]

        non_dot_positions:
            student0: [0,1,2]  # "BBC"
            student1: [2]       # "..C"
            student2: [1,2]     # ".BC"

        b=1 (student1): a=0
            da=3, db=1 -> skip because db<k (k=2) and da>=k, but db<k -> then skip? 
            But note: condition: if da<k and db<k: skip. Here da>=k (3>=2) and db<k (1<2) -> so we don't skip? 
            Actually, the condition: if da<k and db<k -> skip. But here not both are <k? So we do the inner.

            However, in the sample, students 1 and 2 are not similar? But the sample input2 has k=1 and then they become similar.

            For sample1: k=2, so for pair (0,1): 
                da=3, db=1: we use the shorter list: db=1, so we use b's list: positions = [2]
                at j=2: 
                   student0 at 2 is 'C', student1 at 2 is 'C' -> match, count=1 -> not >=2.
                then we break because after this, count + (1-1) = 1<2 -> break the inner loop.
                count=1 <2 -> skip.

        Then b=2: a in [1,0]
            a=1: 
                da = len(student1)=1, db=2 -> use a's list: [2]
                j=2: student2 has at 2: 'C' -> match? and student1 has 'C' -> count=1 -> then break because count + (1-1)=1<2? -> skip.
            a=0:
                da=3, db=2 -> use b's list: [1,2]
                j=1: 
                    student0 at1: 'B', student2 at1: 'B' -> count=1.
                    then check: count + (2-1-0) = 1+ (2-1) = 1+1=2 >=2 -> continue.
                j=2: 
                    student0 at2: 'C', student2 at2: 'C' -> count=2 -> break.
                then we output (0+1, 2+1) = (1,3)

        This matches sample1.

        Sample2: k=1
            b=1: a=0: 
                use b's list (shorter) of [2]: 
                    j=2: match -> count=1>=1 -> break and output (0+1,1+1) = (1,2)

        Sample3: k=3: 
            b=1: a=0: 
                count=1 -> then break by condition: count + (1-1) = 1<3 -> skip.
            b=2: a=1: 
                count=1 -> then break by condition: count + (1-1)=1<3 -> skip.
            b=2: a=0:
                use b's list: [1,2] -> 
                    j=1: count=1 -> then check: 1+(2-1-0)=1+1=2 <3 -> then break? 
                then no output.

        So output -1.

   Therefore, the code is correct.

   But will it run in time? 

        In the worst-case: 
            n=5000, m=3000, and every student has all 3000 non-dot answers, and there is no valid pair (so we have to check every pair and for each pair we iterate 3000 positions).

        Total operations: 12.5e6 * 3000 = 37.5e9.

        In Python, each inner iteration is a few operations (checking grid[a][j] and grid[b][j] and some conditionals). Let's assume 10 operations per iteration. Then 37.5e9 * 10 = 375e9 operations.

        Python might do 1e7 to 1e8 operations per second? Then 375e9 / 1e8 = 3750 seconds.

        So we must hope that in practice the students have few non-dot answers or there is a valid pair early.

   The problem sample input4 has m=12, so the lists have at most 12. And the total operations would be: 
        T = number of students with at least k non-dot answers. In input4, all students have many non-dot answers: 
            "GOOD.LUCK.IN" -> 10
            "WINNING.ICPC" -> 10
            "ASIA.PACIFIC" -> 10
            "CHAMPIONSHIP" -> 11 (or 12? the string is "CHAMPIONSHIP", but it has 12 letters: 
                CHAMPIONSHIP has no dot? -> 12 non-dot.

        So T=4, number of pairs=6, and each pair: at most min(10,12)=10, so total operations 6*10=60.

   Therefore, in practice it might be fast.

   But if the worst-case happens (all students have all 3000 non-dot answers and there is no valid pair) then it is 37.5e9 iterations, which in C++ is borderline (if each iteration is a few cycles) but in Python is too slow.

   We must hope that the test data is not worst-case or that there is a valid pair early.

   The problem requires: the pair with smallest b. So if we find a valid pair with b=1, we break. Therefore, if there is a valid pair with small b, we are safe.

   But if there is no valid pair, then we have to check all pairs, and then it might be slow.

   Given the constraints and the fact that k is at most 5, the intended solution in C++ is O(n^2 * min_answer_length) and relies on the fact that the inner loop might break early. In C++ 37.5e9 might be borderline in 3 seconds (if each iteration is 10 cycles, then 375e9 cycles; 3GHz processor: 125 seconds). So the intended solution might rely on average-case.

   But the problem says: time limit 3.0 seconds.

   Therefore, we must try to optimize further.

   We can try to not iterate over all a for a given b if we can prune based on the non_dot_positions counts. 

        For a given b, we iterate a from b-1 down to 0. 
        But if we could skip some a that have too few non-dot answers, we already do: if da<k and db<k, skip.

        However, if db < k, then we skip the entire b? Actually, for this b, every a: if da<k and db<k, we skip. But if db<k, then we skip every a? 

        So we can do for a given b: if db < k, then we can skip this b entirely? 

        But note: the condition is: if da<k AND db<k -> skip. 
        But if db<k and da>=k, then we do not skip the pair? 
        However, can such a pair have k matches? 
            The number of matches cannot exceed min(da, db) and db<k, so min(da, db) <= db < k -> cannot have k matches.

        Therefore, for a given b, if db < k, then for any a, the pair (a,b) cannot have k matches. So we can skip the entire b.

        Similarly, if db>=k, then we only need to consider a that have da>=k? Because if da<k, then min(da, db) = da < k, so cannot have k matches.

        So we can precompute:
            valid_students = [i for i in range(n) if len(non_dot_positions[i])>=k]

        Then for b in range(1, n):
            if db = len(non_dot_positions[b]) < k:
                continue
            for a in valid_students that are in [0, b-1] and in reverse order? But we want to go from b-1 down to 0, and we want the largest a, so we can iterate a from b-1 down to 0, but only consider a that are in valid_students.

        How to do that? We can precompute an array for each b, the list of a in valid_students with a < b, sorted in descending order. But we are iterating b from 1 to n-1, and we want the largest a first.

        Alternatively, we can store for each student whether it is valid. Then in the a-loop, we skip if not valid.

        We can do:

            valid = [ (len(x)>=k) for x in non_dot_positions ]

            for b in range(1, n):
                if not valid[b]:
                    continue
                for a in range(b-1, -1, -1):
                    if not valid[a]:
                        continue
                    ... then check the pair ...

        Then the number of pairs we check is the number of pairs (a,b) such that both are valid. Let T = number of valid students, then the number of pairs is T*(T-1)/2.

        In worst-case, T = n, so we check 12.5e6 pairs.

        And for each pair, we iterate at most min(da, db) which is 3000.

        So worst-case operations: 12.5e6 * 3000 = 37.5e9.

        But in practice, T might be smaller.

        And for a pair that has no k matches, we hope that the inner loop breaks early by the condition (current_count + remaining < k) after we have found some matches? Actually, if we have found no matches after L - k + 1 iterations, then we break.

        For example, if k=5, then we break after 3000-5+1=2996 iterations? That is not a big savings.

   Therefore, we must hope that either a valid pair is found early or that the shorter list is short.

   We might also try to use the fact that the non_dot_positions lists are sorted? They are stored in increasing order of j. But the early termination condition does not care about j order.

   Given the time, we output the code and hope that the test data is not worst-case.

   Or, we can try to use an additional optimization: if the total number of common non-dot positions is less than k, skip. But we are already doing the condition on the lists.

   We are not storing the entire set of non-dot positions in a set per student, but we are storing the list of indices. We could compute the intersection of the two lists of indices? But that would be O(da+db) and then we iterate over the intersection? But then we would do:

        common_positions = sorted(list(set(non_dot_positions[a]) & set(non_dot_positions[b]))   # O(da+db) and then O(da+db) for the set and then the intersection.

        then iterate over common_positions and count the matches.

        Then the work per pair is O(da+db). In the worst-case, da+db = 6000, and 12.5e6 * 6000 = 75e9, which is even worse.

   Therefore, we output the first method with the valid filter and hope for the best.

   Let's code accordingly.

   Steps:

        Precompute non_dot_positions and valid.

        for b in range(1, n):
            if not valid[b]: 
                continue
            for a in range(b-1, -1, -1):
                if not valid[a]:
                    continue
                da = len(non_dot_positions[a])
                db = len(non_dot_positions[b])   # we know db>=k, and da>=k by valid, so skip the condition on both<k.

                count = 0
                if da <= db:
                    positions = non_dot_positions[a]
                    L = da
                    for idx, j in enumerate(positions):
                        if grid[b][j] == grid[a][j]:   # and by the list of a, grid[a][j] is non-dot. But grid[b][j] might be dot? 
                            # But j is in non_dot_positions[a], so grid[a][j] is non-dot. But grid[b][j] might be dot -> then not match.
                            if grid[b][j] != '.':
                                count += 1
                                if count >= k:
                                    break
                        # If we are here, either grid[b][j]=='.' or grid[b][j]!=grid[a][j] -> not a match.
                        # Then check early termination: 
                        if count + (L - idx - 1) < k:
                            break
                else:
                    positions = non_dot_positions[b]
                    L = db
                    for idx, j in enumerate(positions):
                        if grid[a][j] == grid[b][j]:
                            if grid[a][j] != '.':
                                count += 1
                                if count >= k:
                                    break
                        if count + (L - idx - 1) < k:
                            break

                if count >= k:
                    print(a+1, b+1)
                    exit(0)

        print(-1)

   Note: in the inner loop, we have to check that the other student has non-dot at j? In the first branch, we use a's list: then we know grid[a][j] is non-dot. But we must check grid[b][j] != '.'? Yes, because if grid[b][j] is '.', then it doesn't count.

   However, note: we are only iterating over the non-dot positions of one student. For the other student, we must check if it is non-dot.

   This matches the sample.

   We hope that this is fast enough for the provided test data.

   Let's run sample4: 
        Input: 
            4 12 2
            GOOD.LUCK.IN   -> 10 non-dot: [0,1,2,3,5,6,7,8,10,11]  -> but the string: 
                index0: 'G'
                index1: 'O'
                index2: 'O'
                index3: 'D'
                index4: '.' -> skip
                index5: 'L'
                index6: 'U'
                index7: 'C'
                index8: 'K'
                index9: '.' -> skip
                index10: 'I'
                index11: 'N'

            Similarly for others.

        The sample output is 2 3.

        We need to find the pair (1,2) in 0-indexed: a=1, b=2.

        b=2 (0-indexed student2) is "ASIA.PACIFIC", which has non-dot: 
            positions: [0,1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10]  (10 non-dot)

        We iterate b from 1 to 3 (0-indexed b=1,2,3). 
        For b=1: student1: "WINNING.ICPC" -> valid? 10>=2 -> valid.
            a=0: valid, then we compare student0 and student1: 
                da=10, db=10 -> we take the list of a or b? doesn't matter, we take a's list (da<=db -> we use a's list? no, because da=10, db=10 -> da<=db -> use a's list.
                iterate over a's positions: [0,1,2,3,5,6,7,8,10,11] 
                j0:0 -> student0: 'G', student1: 'W' -> not match -> then condition: count=0, remaining=10-0-1=9 -> 0+9>=2 -> continue.
                j1:1: 'O' vs 'I' -> not match -> count=0, remaining=8 -> 0+8>=2 -> continue.
                j2:2: 'O' vs 'N' -> not match -> count=0, remaining=7 -> 0+7>=2 -> continue.
                j3:3: 'D' vs 'N' -> not match -> count=0, remaining=6 -> continue.
                j4:5: 'L' vs 'I' -> not match -> count=0, remaining=5 -> 0+5>=2 -> continue.
                j5:6: 'U' vs 'N' -> not match -> count=0, remaining=4 -> continue.
                j6:7: 'C' vs 'G' -> not match -> count=0, remaining=3 -> continue.
                j7:8: 'K' vs '.' -> wait, student1 at position8 is '.'? 
                    But the string for student1: "WINNING.ICPC" -> 
                        0:W,1:I,2:N,3:N,4:I,5:N,6:G,7:.,8:I,9:C,10:P,11:C -> so position8 is '.'? 
                    Actually, the string has length 12: 
                        "WINNING.ICPC" -> 
                        0:W,1:I,2:N,3:N,4:I,5:N,6:G,7:.,8:I,9:C,10:P,11:C -> so position8 is 'I'? 
                    Correction: the string is 12 characters: 
                        "WINNING.ICPC" -> maybe it's "WINNING.ICPC" has 12 characters? 
                        WINNING.ICPC -> 7 letters then '.' then ICPC -> 7+1+4=12.

                    So positions: 
                        0:W, 1:I, 2:N, 3:N, 4:I, 5:N, 6:G, 7:., 8:I, 9:C, 10:P, 11:C.

                    So position8 is 'I'. 
                So j=8: student0: 'K' (from "GOOD.LUCK.IN" -> position8 is 'K') and student1: 'I' -> not match.

                j8:10: student0: 'I', student1: 'P'? -> not match.

                j9:11: student0: 'N', student1: 'C' -> not match.

                count=0 -> then break after j9? no, we break by the condition at the last step? 
                After j9: idx=9, then condition: count + (10-9-1) = 0+ (10-9-1)=0<2 -> break.

            Then a=0 fails.

        Then b=2: 
            a=1: valid.
                da=10, db=10 -> use a's list? (we can use either, but we choose the list of a if da<=db, which it is) -> use student1's list: [0,1,2,3,5,6,7,8,10,11] 
                j0:0: student1: 'W', student2: 'A' -> not match.
                j1:1: 'I' vs 'S' -> not match.
                j2:2: 'N' vs 'I' -> not match.
                j3:3: 'N' vs 'A' -> not match.
                j4:5: 'N' vs 'P' -> not match.
                j5:6: 'G' vs 'A' -> not match.
                j6:7: '.' -> but wait, the list for student1: we stored non-dot positions: position7 is '.'? -> no, we stored non-dot positions: so we have stored only non-dot positions. 
                    In student1, position7 is '.' -> so it should not be in the list. 
                    But our stored list for student1: 
                        "WINNING.ICPC" -> the non-dot positions: 
                        0,1,2,3,5,6,8,9,10,11 -> 10 non-dot, but we stored [0,1,2,3,5,6,7,8,10,11]? 
                    Actually, we stored by:
                        for j in range(m):
                            if grid[i][j]!='.' then append j.

                    For student1: 
                        0:W -> non-dot
                        1:I -> non-dot
                        2:N -> non-dot
                        3:N -> non-dot
                        4: I? -> wait the string: "WINNING.ICPC" -> 
                            index0: 'W'
                            index1: 'I'
                            index2: 'N'
                            index3: 'N'
                            index4: 'I' -> but wait, the sample input says "WINNING.ICPC" -> 
                            Actually, the sample input: 
                                "GOOD.LUCK.IN"
                                "WINNING.ICPC"
                                "ASIA.PACIFIC"
                                "CHAMPIONSHIP"

                        The second string: "WINNING.ICPC" has 12 letters: 
                            W I N N I N G . I C P C -> so index7 is '.'.

                    So we stored for student1: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11]? 
                    But wait, the input has 12 letters, and we have 11 non-dot? 

                Actually, the string is "WINNING.ICPC" -> 
                    W at0, I at1, N at2, N at3, I at4, N at5, G at6, . at7, I at8, C at9, P at10, C at11.

                So non-dot: 11 positions.

                Then the list for student1 is [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11] (11 elements).

                Then for the pair (1,2) (0-indexed), we use student1's list (because da=11, db=10 -> we use the shorter list, which is student2: db=10? 
                Actually, we do: 
                    if da<=db: then use a's list (student1, da=11) -> but 11<=10? no -> else: use b's list (student2, db=10).

                So we use student2's list: non_dot_positions[2] = [0,1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10]   (because "ASIA.PACIFIC": 
                    A S I A . P A C I F I C? 
                    Actually: 
                        0: A
                        1: S
                        2: I
                        3: A
                        4: . 
                        5: P
                        6: A
                        7: C
                        8: I
                        9: F
                        10: I
                        11: C   -> but wait, the string is "ASIA.PACIFIC", so 
                        ASIA.PACIFIC -> 4 letters, then '.' then 6 letters? 
                        That's 4+1+6=11, but the problem says m=12? 
                    The sample input: 
                        "4 12 2"
                        "GOOD.LUCK.IN" -> 12
                        "WINNING.ICPC" -> 12
                        "ASIA.PACIFIC" -> 12: ASIA.PACIFIC has 11? -> maybe it's "ASIA.PACIFIC "? 

                The problem says: 4 12 2, and then 4 lines of 12 characters.

                Let me count:
                    GOOD.LUCK.IN -> 12
                    WINNING.ICPC -> 12: "WINNING.ICPC" -> 12: WINNING.ICPC is 7 (WINNING) +1 (.) + 4 (ICPC) = 12.
                    ASIA.PACIFIC -> 12: ASIA (4) + . (1) + PACIFIC (7) -> 4+1+7=12? but PACIFIC is 7? 
                        A S I A . P A C I F I C -> 12? 
                    and CHAMPIONSHIP: 12.

                So the third string: "ASIA.PACIFIC" -> 
                    index0: 'A'
                    index1: 'S'
                    index2: 'I'
                    index3: 'A'
                    index4: '.' 
                    index5: 'P'
                    index6: 'A'
                    index7: 'C'
                    index8: 'I'
                    index9: 'F'
                    index10: 'I'
                    index11: 'C'

                So non-dot: 11 (all except index4).

                Then for student2: non_dot_positions = [0,1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,11] -> 11? 

                Then for the pair (1,2): 
                    da = student1: 11, db= student2: 11 -> then we use a's list (student1) because da<=db -> use student1's list: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11] (11 elements)

                Now iterate:
                    j0:0: student1: 'W', student2: 'A' -> not match.
                    j1:1: 'I' vs 'S' -> not match.
                    j2:2: 'N' vs 'I' -> not match.
                    j3:3: 'N' vs 'A' -> not match.
                    j4:4: 'I' (student1 at4 is 'I') -> student2 at4 is '.' -> skip (but note: we are using student1's list, and we are at j=4. We must check: 
                         if grid[2][4] is non-dot? -> it is '.' -> not match.

                    j5:5: 'N' (student1) vs student2: 'P' -> not match.
                    j6:6: 'G' vs 'A' -> not match.
                    j7:8: 'I' (student1) vs student2: 'I'? at8? -> student2 at8 is 'I'. 
                         match -> count=1.
                         condition: count + (11-7-1) = 1+ (11-7-1)=1+3=4>=2 -> continue.

                    j8:9: 'C' (student1) and student2: 'F'? -> not match.
                    j9:10: 'P' and 'I'? -> not match.
                    j10:11: 'C' and 'C'? -> match -> count=2 -> break.

                Then we output (1+1, 2+1) = (2,3) in 1-indexed.

        So it matches.

   Therefore, we output the code with the valid filter.

   Note: we must be cautious to store the non_dot_positions correctly.

   Let's run the sample with the valid filter.

   We'll do:

        n, m, k = 4, 12, 2
        grid = [ "GOOD.LUCK.IN", "WINNING.ICPC", "ASIA.PACIFIC", "CHAMPIONSHIP" ]

        non_dot_positions for each:
            s0: [0,1,2,3,5,6,7,8,10,11]  (10 non-dot: because at index4 and index9 are dots) -> valid? 10>=2 -> valid.
            s1: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11] (11) -> valid.
            s2: [0,1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,11] (11) -> valid.
            s3: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]? -> if "CHAMPIONSHIP" has no dot, then 12 -> valid.

        Then we iterate b from 1 to 3 (0-indexed: 1,2,3)

        b=1: student1: valid -> then a=0: valid -> check: 
            da=10, db=11 -> use a's list: [0,1,2,3,5,6,7,8,10,11] (10)
            ... and we do 10 iterations and break -> no output.

        b=2: student2: valid -> a=1: valid -> then we do and find 2 matches -> output (1,2) in 0-indexed -> (1+1,2+1) = (2,3)

        So we output "2 3".

   This matches sample4.

   We hope it passes.

   Note: worst-case might be too slow in Python, but we hope the test data is not worst-case.

   We output the code accordingly.

   IMPORTANT: We must use sys.stdin for speed.

   Let me rewrite with sys.stdin.

   Code:

        import sys

        data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()
        n, m, k = map(int, data[0].split())
        grid = [line.strip() for line in data[1:1+n]]

        non_dot_positions = []
        valid = []
        for i in range(n):
            positions = []
            for j in range(m):
                if grid[i][j] != '.':
                    positions.append(j)

   Let's test with the samples.

   We already did.

   We hope.

   Note: The condition in the inner loop: 
        if grid[b][j] != '.' and grid[a][j] == grid[b][j]: 
        This is correct: because if grid[b][j] is dot, then it doesn't count, and we are only iterating the non-dot positions of one student, so the other student might be dot.

   We run sample1: 
        k=2, and we break at the pair (0,2) and output (1,3).

   Sample2: k=1, break at (0,1) and output (1,2).

   Sample3: no output -> -1.

   Sample4: output (2,3).

   Therefore, we output the code.
