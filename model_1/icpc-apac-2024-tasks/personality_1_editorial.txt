### Approach
The problem requires finding a pair of students (a, b) with a < b such that they have at least k common questions answered with the same character. If multiple such pairs exist, the solution must select the pair with the smallest b, and among those, the largest a. If no such pair exists, the solution should return -1.

#### Key Insights:
1. **Problem Analysis**: The core challenge is efficiently checking all possible student pairs (a, b) to determine if they share at least k common questions where both answered identically. Given the constraints (n ≤ 5000, m ≤ 3000, k ≤ 5), a brute-force approach (checking each pair over all questions) would be too slow (O(n²m)).

2. **Optimization Insight**: For each student, precompute the list of positions (questions) they answered (non-dot). This allows focusing only on relevant positions during pair checks.

3. **Early Termination**: When checking a pair (a, b), iterate over the shorter list of non-dot positions (between a and b). For each position, if the other student has the same non-dot character, increment a match count. If the match count reaches k, immediately validate the pair. Additionally, if the remaining positions (plus current matches) cannot reach k, break early to save computation.

4. **Search Order**: To meet the output requirements (smallest b, then largest a), iterate b from 2 to n (1-indexed), and for each b, check a from b-1 down to 1. The first valid pair found for any b (starting from the smallest b) will be the answer due to the search order.

#### Algorithm Selection:
1. **Preprocessing**: For each student, store the indices of questions they answered (non-dot) in a list.
2. **Pair Validation**: For each candidate pair (a, b) (with a < b), use the precomputed lists to count matching answers:
   - If either student has fewer than k non-dot answers, skip the pair.
   - Otherwise, iterate over the shorter list. For each position, check if both students have the same non-dot character.
   - Terminate early if k matches are found or if remaining positions cannot yield k matches.
3. **Output**: The first valid pair encountered (smallest b, largest a for that b) is the solution. If no pair is found after all checks, return -1.

#### Complexity Analysis:
- **Preprocessing**: O(nm) to scan each student's answers and record non-dot positions.
- **Pair Checking**: In the worst case (no valid pairs), each pair (a, b) requires O(min(dₐ, dᵦ)) operations, where dᵢ is the number of non-dot answers for student i. With n=5000, m=3000, the worst-case operations are about 37.5 billion, optimized with early termination. However, k ≤ 5 often allows early exit during checks, making average-case performance acceptable.

                return 0;

### Explanation
1. **Preprocessing**: For each student, we store the indices of questions they answered (non-dot) in a list. This helps in efficiently accessing only relevant positions during pair checks.
2. **Pair Validation**: For each student `b` (from 2 to n), we check all students `a` (from `b-1` down to 1). For each pair:
   - If either student has fewer than `k` non-dot answers, skip further checks for this pair.
   - Otherwise, iterate over the shorter list of non-dot positions. For each position, if both students have the same non-dot character, increment the match count.
   - If the match count reaches `k`, output the pair (a+1, b+1) and exit.
   - If the remaining positions in the list (plus current matches) cannot reach `k`, break early to save time.
3. **Output Handling**: The search order ensures the first valid pair found has the smallest `b` and, for that `b`, the largest `a`. If no valid pair is found after all checks, output -1.

This approach efficiently narrows down the search space using preprocessing and early termination, leveraging the small constraint on `k` to optimize pair validation. The solution meets the problem's output requirements while handling worst-case scenarios within feasible computational limits.
