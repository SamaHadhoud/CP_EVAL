 Okay, we are given t test cases. For each test case, we are given n and a sequence a1, a2, ... an (each a_i between 0 and 60). We are to find the smallest non-negative integer x such that for all i from 0 to n-1, p(x+i) = a_{i+1}.

 Important constraints:
   - t up to 1000, but the sum of n across test cases <= 500,000.
   - Each a_i is between 0 and 60.

 Observing the problem:

 We note that the function p(x) (popcount) has known properties. In particular, when moving from x to x+1, we have:

   p(x+1) = p(x) - t + 1

 where t is the number of trailing ones in x.

 However, we are matching a sequence of n consecutive popcounts.

 How can we approach the problem?

 Idea 1: Since the total n across test cases is bounded by 500,000, we can try to design an algorithm that runs in O(n) per test case? But note: worst-case n can be 500,000 and t up to 1000, but the sum of n is 500,000 so worst-case t is 1000, but the total n is 500,000 so worst-case we have about 1000 test cases each with n=500? Actually, the problem says the sum of n across test cases <= 500,000. So we can have up to 500,000 numbers in total.

 However, note that the values of a_i are bounded (0 to 60). Also, we are looking for the smallest x that matches the sequence.

 How to search for x?

 Important: The sequence a_i must satisfy some necessary conditions.

 Condition 1: The sequence must be consistent with the relation between consecutive popcounts.

 Specifically, we know that when we increment by 1, the popcount changes in a particular way.

 We can write:

   Let x_i = x + i.

   Then:
      p(x_{i+1}) = p(x_i + 1) = p(x_i) - t_i + 1

   where t_i is the number of trailing ones in x_i.

 Therefore, we have:

      a_{i+1} = a_i - t_i + 1   =>   t_i = a_i + 1 - a_{i+1}

 But note: t_i must be at least 1 (because we are adding 1, so we break at least one trailing one) and at most the entire block of trailing ones. Actually, t_i can be zero? But the formula: when there are trailing zeros, we flip the last zero to one and set the trailing ones to zeros? Actually, no: we break a trailing block of ones and then set the next zero to one. So the trailing ones we break is exactly the consecutive ones at the end. And then we set the next zero to one. So the number of trailing ones in x_i is t_i, and then:

   x_i = ...01...1 (with t_i ones at the end) -> becomes ...10...0 (with t_i zeros) and then we set the next zero to one? Actually, we just break the trailing ones and set the next zero to one. So:

   x_i + 1 = x_i with the trailing t_i ones becoming zeros and the next bit (which was zero) becomes one.

 Therefore, the popcount change: we remove t_i ones and add one one: so net change: 1 - t_i.

 So we have:

   a_{i+1} = a_i - t_i + 1.

 Therefore, for each i from 0 to n-2:

   t_i = a_i + 1 - a_{i+1}

 Conditions:

   (a) t_i must be an integer between 1 and ...? Actually, we cannot have t_i = 0 because then we wouldn't break any ones? Actually, if there are no trailing ones, then the trailing block we break is of length 0? But then the formula would be: a_{i+1} = a_i + 1? 

 However, let's check:

   If x_i is even? Then it ends with 0. Then x_i+1 ends with 1 and the rest is the same. So p(x_i+1) = p(x_i) + 1? Actually, no: because the last bit becomes one, but if the last bit was zero, then we are just changing one zero to one -> so we add one. Hence:

      p(x_i+1) = p(x_i) + 1.

   So in that case, the trailing ones broken is 0? But then our formula would be: a_{i+1} = a_i - 0 + 1? -> a_i + 1.

   Similarly, if x_i is odd, then we break a block of trailing ones of length t_i (at least 1). Then a_{i+1} = a_i - t_i + 1.

 Therefore, we can define:

   For each i (from 0 to n-2):

      if a_{i+1} = a_i + 1, then we must have that the number of trailing ones in x_i is 0? Actually, that would imply t_i = 0? But then the formula holds: a_{i+1} = a_i - 0 + 1.

      if a_{i+1} <= a_i, then we must have t_i = a_i + 1 - a_{i+1} and t_i must be at least 1.

      However, note: the trailing ones t_i can be 0 only when the next bit is not one? Actually, the trailing ones are defined as the consecutive ones at the end. So if the last bit is 0, then there are zero trailing ones. So the condition for t_i=0 is when the last bit is 0.

 But also note: the value t_i must be at least 1 if the last bit is 1. So:

   Condition: t_i = a_i + 1 - a_{i+1} must be at least 0? Actually, we see:

      if a_{i+1} = a_i + 1, then t_i = 0 -> valid.

      if a_{i+1} <= a_i, then t_i = a_i - a_{i+1} + 1 must be at least 1 -> which it is (since a_i>=a_{i+1}).

      if a_{i+1} > a_i+1? Then we get t_i = a_i - a_{i+1} + 1 < 0 -> invalid.

      if a_{i+1} = a_i + 2? Then t_i = a_i - (a_i+2) + 1 = -1 -> invalid.

 Therefore, for the entire sequence we must have:

      For each i from 0 to n-2: a_{i+1} <= a_i + 1   and   a_{i+1} >= a_i - (max_possible_t_i)  ... but we know that the trailing ones cannot exceed the entire number of ones? Actually, no: the trailing ones are just the consecutive ones at the end, and they can be as large as the bit-length? But note: the popcount a_i is at most 60, so the trailing ones cannot exceed a_i. Therefore, we must have:

          a_{i+1} >= a_i - (a_i) + 1 = 1? 

          Actually: t_i = a_i - a_{i+1} + 1 must be at least 1 (if the last bit is one) OR we can have t_i=0 (if last bit is zero) and then a_{i+1}=a_i+1.

          But also note: if the last bit is one, then t_i>=1, so we require:

             a_{i+1} = a_i - t_i + 1 <= a_i   (because t_i>=1) and also a_{i+1} >= a_i - (max_t_i) + 1.

          However, the maximum t_i is the entire block of ones at the end. But we don't know the entire binary representation. However, we know that the trailing ones cannot exceed the total number of ones, and also they cannot exceed the bit-length? Actually, the trailing ones can be arbitrarily long? But note: the popcount is bounded (a_i<=60). So the trailing ones cannot exceed 60.

          Therefore, we must have: t_i = a_i - a_{i+1} + 1 <= a_i   => a_{i+1} >= 1? Actually, that's not the constraint we get.

          Actually: we have t_i = a_i - a_{i+1} + 1, and if the last bit is one, then t_i must be at least 1 and at most a_i? Why at most a_i? Because we are breaking a block of ones that are included in the popcount. So:

             1 <= t_i <= a_i   =>  1 <= a_i - a_{i+1} + 1 <= a_i

          =>  0 <= a_i - a_{i+1} <= a_i-1

          =>  a_{i+1} <= a_i   and   a_{i+1} >= a_i - (a_i-1) = 1? 

          But wait: if a_i is 0, then we cannot have the last bit one? Because then we would have at least one one. So if a_i=0, then the entire number is zero -> then the trailing ones are 0? Actually, the number is zero: then x_i=0, then x_i+1=1 -> p(1)=1. So we would have a_{i+1}=1. Therefore, if a_i=0, then we must have a_{i+1}=1? 

          Actually, we can also have a_i=0 and then the next one must be 1? Or if n=1? Then no constraint.

          So the constraints for consecutive elements:

            If i from 0 to n-2:

               Case 1: the last bit of x_i is 0 -> then a_{i+1} = a_i + 1.

               Case 2: the last bit of x_i is 1 -> then a_{i+1} = a_i - t_i + 1, and t_i (number of trailing ones) must be at least 1 and at most min(a_i, ...) but we know that the trailing ones cannot exceed the total number of ones, and also we cannot have more than the entire binary representation? Actually, the trailing ones are limited by the bit-length of the number? But note: the popcount is a_i, so the trailing ones cannot exceed a_i. Also, the trailing ones can be arbitrarily long? But the number of bits of x_i is at most about 60? Actually, no: x_i could be a huge number. However, the popcount is bounded by 60, so the trailing ones cannot exceed 60? Actually, the trailing ones are a contiguous block at the end, so they are included in the popcount. Therefore, t_i <= a_i.

          Therefore, the necessary conditions for the entire sequence (for consecutive terms) are:

            For each i from 0 to n-2:

               a_{i+1} must be either:
                 (a) a_i + 1,   OR
                 (b) a_i - t_i + 1 for some integer t_i in [1, a_i]   -> which implies: a_{i+1} must be between a_i - a_i + 1 = 1 and a_i? 

               Specifically, we have:

                 If a_i = 0, then we must have a_{i+1} = 1 (because the trailing ones would be 0? Actually, if a_i=0 then x_i=0, so trailing ones=0? Then the next popcount must be 1). So the only possibility is a_{i+1}=1.

                 If a_i>=1, then a_{i+1} must be either a_i+1 or at most a_i and at least 1? Actually, no: we have:

                    if the last bit is 0: then a_{i+1}=a_i+1.
                    if the last bit is 1: then a_{i+1}=a_i - t_i + 1, and t_i in [1, a_i] -> so a_{i+1} in [a_i - a_i + 1, a_i - 1 + 1] = [1, a_i].

                 Therefore, a_{i+1} must be in the set {a_i+1} âˆª [1, a_i].

                 But note: [1, a_i] is contiguous.

                 So: we must have 1 <= a_{i+1} <= a_i+1.

                 However, we also have the constraint that if a_{i+1} is in [1, a_i], then we require t_i = a_i - a_{i+1} + 1 to be an integer? It is, but also we require that the trailing ones of x_i is exactly t_i.

          But note: we also have the constraint that if a_{i+1} = a_i+1, then the last bit of x_i must be 0. And if a_{i+1} <= a_i, then the last bit of x_i must be 1 and the trailing ones must be t_i = a_i - a_{i+1} + 1.

          How does this relate to the entire sequence? We can deduce the trailing ones for every step? Actually, we can compute t_i for every i (for consecutive terms) as:

             t_i = 
                 if a_{i+1} == a_i+1: then 0
                 else: t_i = a_i - a_{i+1} + 1   (and then we require 1<=t_i<=a_i)

          Therefore, we can check the entire sequence:

            Step 1: Check for i in [0, n-2]:
                if a_{i+1} == a_i + 1: then t_i = 0 -> valid.
                else if a_{i+1} <= a_i and a_{i+1} >= a_i - a_i + 1 = 1: then t_i = a_i - a_{i+1} + 1 -> and we require that t_i is at least 1 and at most a_i. But note: since a_{i+1} <= a_i and a_{i+1}>=1, then t_i = a_i - a_{i+1}+1 is at least 1 and at most a_i (because a_{i+1}>=1 => t_i<=a_i, and a_{i+1}<=a_i => t_i>=1). So this is valid? However, we must also check that the trailing ones condition is consistent with the bits we have set.

          But wait: what if the trailing ones we set in step i conflicts with the bits we set in previous steps? For example, the trailing ones we break at step i must be consistent with the bits we assumed in the previous steps.

 How to reconstruct x?

 We note that the entire sequence of popcounts must be consistent with the binary representation of x and the following numbers.

 However, we are to find the smallest x. We can try to reconstruct x from the least significant bit (LSB) to higher bits? We know the trailing ones for each step? Actually, for each i, we know the trailing ones of x_i. And note that the trailing ones of x_i determine the lower t_i+1 bits of x_i: the last t_i bits are ones and the bit before that is zero.

 Therefore, we can represent x_i as:

      x_i = ... 0 1 1 ... 1   (with t_i ones at the end)   [if t_i>=1]

      x_i = ... ? 0   [if t_i=0]

 But note: if t_i=0, then the last bit is 0.

 However, the same x_i appears as the starting number of the sequence? Actually, we are given x0 = x, x1 = x+1, ... x_{n-1}=x+n-1.

 How to relate the bits of x0, x1, ...?

 We can consider the entire sequence of numbers and the bits that are set. But note that the numbers are consecutive, so the binary representations are connected.

 Alternate approach:

   We know the entire sequence a0, a1, ... a_{n-1}. We can compute the required trailing ones for each x_i (for i from 0 to n-2) as:

        t_i = 
            if a_{i+1} == a_i + 1 -> 0
            else -> a_i - a_{i+1} + 1

   Then, we can try to reconstruct the bits of x0 (x) from the least significant bit to the most.

   How?

      Let x0 = x.

      We know the trailing ones of x0: t0. Then the last t0+1 bits of x0 are: [bit0, bit1, ..., bit_{t0}] = [1,1,...,1,0]? Actually, the last t0 bits are ones and the (t0)-th bit (counting from 0) is 0? Actually, the trailing ones are the consecutive ones from the least significant bit. So:

          x0 mod 2^(t0+1) = (1 << t0) - 1   ??? But that would be if the next bit were zero? Actually, we break at the next zero. So:

          x0 mod 2^(t0+1) = (1<<t0) - 1   -> but wait, that is a number with the last t0 bits as ones and the (t0)-th bit is zero? Actually, no: (1<<t0) - 1 is a number with t0 ones. But we require that the next bit (the bit at position t0) is zero. So the entire block of the last t0+1 bits is: 0 followed by t0 ones? No, that would be ...0 1...1 (with t0 ones) but then the value would be (0<<t0) + (1<<t0)-1? Actually, the representation is:

          ... b_{k} ... b_{t0} b_{t0-1} ... b_0
          where b_{t0} must be 0 and b_{t0-1} to b_0 are ones.

          Therefore, the value mod 2^(t0+1) is: (0 << t0) + ( (1<<t0) - 1 ) = (1<<t0) - 1.

          But note: if t0=0, then we require the last bit is 0 -> then mod 2^1 = 0.

      Then x0+1: we break the trailing ones and set the next bit to one? So:

          x1 = x0+1 = ... (b_{t0} becomes 1) and the last t0 bits become zeros.

          Then we can compute the trailing ones for x1? Actually, we know t1 from the sequence.

      How to reconstruct the bits for x1? The last t0 bits of x1 are zeros. Then the next bit is set to one. Then the trailing ones for x1 would start at the next set of ones? But we know t1: so the trailing ones for x1 must be t1.

      Therefore, the last t1 bits of x1 must be ones? But the last t0 bits of x1 are zeros. So we require that t1 must be 0? Or if there are ones beyond the last t0 bits? Actually, the trailing ones of x1 start at the next bit. Since the last t0 bits are zeros and then the bit at position t0 is set to one, then the trailing ones for x1 would start at the bit at position t0. So the trailing ones for x1 are the consecutive ones starting at bit t0 and going upward? And we require that the trailing ones for x1 is t1.

      Therefore, the bits of x1 from the LSB: 
          bits 0 to t0-1: 0
          bit t0: 1
          then we require that the next t1 bits (bits t0+1 to t0+t1) are ones? and then the bit at t0+t1+1 must be zero.

      But note: x1 = x0+1, so we have:

          x0: ... 0 1 1 ... 1   (t0 ones) -> mod 2^(t0+1) = (1<<t0)-1.
          x1: ... 1 0 0 ... 0   -> but then we set the last t0 bits to zeros and the bit at position t0 to one? Actually, we add one to x0: so we get:

             ... (the part above t0) becomes ... (b_{t0}+1) and then the last t0 bits become zeros? But we set the bit at position t0 to one? Actually, no: we break the trailing ones and set the next bit. So:

                x0: ... b_{t0} (which is 0) then t0 ones -> adding one: the last t0 ones become zeros and the b_{t0} becomes 1.

          So x1: ... 1 and then t0 zeros.

          Then the trailing ones of x1: we look at the LSB: the first bit is 0 -> so trailing ones? Actually, we have to look from the LSB: the trailing ones start at the first one? But the last bit is zero. So the trailing ones of x1 is 0? But we require t1 from the sequence? 

          This seems inconsistent.

      Actually, the trailing ones of x1 are not starting at the LSB? They start at the first one we meet? Actually, no: the trailing ones are the consecutive ones starting from the LSB. But in x1, the LSB is zero -> so the trailing ones of x1 are 0? 

      But then we have: if t0>=1, then the trailing ones for x1 is 0? Then from the sequence we have:

          t1 = a1 - a2 + 1? or if the next term a2 = a1+1 then t1=0? 

      How do we relate? 

          We have a0 = p(x0), a1 = p(x1). Then:

             p(x1) = p(x0) - t0 + 1 = a0 - t0 + 1 = a1.

          Then from the sequence, we have a1 = a0 - t0 + 1 -> so t0 = a0 - a1 + 1.

          And then for x1: we know that the last t0 bits are zeros and the bit at t0 is set to 1. Then the trailing ones of x1: we look from the LSB: we see zeros until we hit the bit at t0 which is 1? Then we look beyond: the trailing ones of x1 are the consecutive ones starting at the bit at t0? Actually, no: the trailing ones are defined as the consecutive ones starting at the LSB. Since the LSB is 0, the trailing ones of x1 is 0.

          Therefore, we must have t1=0? But what if the sequence says t1>0? Then we have a problem.

      How do we reconcile?

          Actually, the trailing ones for x1 are defined as the consecutive ones starting at the least significant bit. Since the least significant bit is 0, there are no ones at the end -> trailing ones = 0.

          Then from the recurrence: for x1, the next term a2 must be a1+1? because the trailing ones of x1 is 0 -> then a2 = a1+1.

          So if the sequence has a2 != a1+1, then we have a conflict.

      Therefore, we can deduce:

          After a step that breaks t_i ones (so t_i>=1), the next number x_{i+1} has last t_i bits as zeros and the next bit set to one. Then the trailing ones of x_{i+1} are 0? Actually, no: it might have ones beyond the last t_i bits? The trailing ones of x_{i+1} start at the bit at position t_i? But the trailing ones are defined as consecutive ones starting at the LSB. Since the LSB is 0, the trailing ones of x_{i+1} is 0.

          Therefore, the next term must satisfy: a_{i+2} = a_{i+1} + 1? 

          But wait: what if the bit at position t_i (in x_{i+1}) is followed by ones? Then we have:

             x_{i+1} = ... 0 1 ... 1 1 ... with the last t_i bits zeros and then at position t_i we have 1, and then beyond we have ones? 

          Then the trailing ones of x_{i+1} is not 0? Actually, the trailing ones are the consecutive ones starting at the LSB. The LSB is 0 -> so the trailing ones are 0.

          Why? The trailing ones must start at the very first bit. Since the first bit is 0, we break immediately.

          Therefore, regardless of the bits beyond the last t_i bits, the trailing ones of x_{i+1} is 0.

          So we must have: after a step that uses t_i>=1, the next step must have a_{i+2} = a_{i+1} + 1? 

          But wait: we have:

             x_{i+1} = ... 1 0...0 (with t_i zeros) -> then the trailing ones of x_{i+1} is 0 -> then the next popcount: p(x_{i+1}+1) = p(x_{i+1}) + 1? -> so a_{i+2} = a_{i+1} + 1.

          Therefore, we have a necessary condition:

             For each i from 0 to n-2:

                 If t_i >= 1 (i.e., a_{i+1} != a_i+1), then we must have that at the next step i+1 (if i+1 is within the sequence) the trailing ones t_{i+1} must be 0? Actually, not exactly: the condition for the next step is independent? But we just deduced that the trailing ones of x_{i+1} is 0, so the next step must have:

                    a_{i+2} = a_{i+1} + 1.

          Therefore, if we have a step i with t_i>=1, then we must have that the next term a_{i+2} must be a_{i+1}+1.

          This is a strong condition.

      Example: 
          Sequence: [3, 3, 4] -> 
            i=0: a0=3, a1=3 -> then t0 = 3 - 3 + 1 = 1 (>=1) -> then we require a2 = a1+1 = 4? -> yes, so it's valid.

          Then i=1: a1=3, a2=4 -> t1 = 0 -> valid.

      How about [3, 2, 3]?
          i0: a0=3, a1=2 -> t0=3-2+1=2 -> then we require a2 = a1+1 = 3 -> so the sequence [3,2,3] is valid? 

          But then we have:

            x0: ... 0 11 -> so the last 2 bits are ones and the next bit is zero? Then x0 mod 4 = 3 (binary 11).

            Then x1 = x0+1 = ... 1 00 -> so the last two bits are zeros and the next bit is one? Then the entire number: ...100 -> then p(x1) = p(x0) - 2 + 1 = 3-2+1=2 -> correct.

            Then x2 = x1+1 = ...101 -> p(x2)= ... how many ones? The ... part is the same as the ... part of x0? But we broke the trailing ones and set the next bit to one. Then we added one: the last two bits become 00 -> then we set the first zero to one -> becomes 01? Actually:

                x1 = ...100
                x1+1 = ...101 -> popcount: the ... part is the same as x1? Then the last two bits: 01 -> so we added one one and removed zero ones? So p(x2)=p(x1)+1? -> 3.

          So [3,2,3] is valid.

          However, according to our condition: after a step with t0=2 (which is >=1), we require the next step to have a2 = a1+1? -> 2+1=3 -> which is satisfied.

      Therefore, we have a necessary condition for the entire sequence:

          Condition 1: For every i from 0 to n-2: 
             1 <= a_{i+1} <= a_i+1   [because if a_{i+1} is too large, we break] and also if a_{i+1} <= a_i, then we have a_{i+1} must be at least 1.

          Condition 2: Moreover, if at step i we have t_i>=1 (i.e., a_{i+1} != a_i+1), then we require that the next term (if it exists) must be a_{i+2} = a_{i+1} + 1.

          Actually, condition 2 can be restated: after any step that does not end with a zero (i.e., we broke some ones) then the next step must be an increment by one.

          But note: we have:

             i: we break t_i ones -> then x_{i+1} has last t_i bits zeros and the next bit set to one -> then the trailing ones of x_{i+1} is 0 -> so the next step must be an increment by one? -> so a_{i+2} = a_{i+1} + 1.

          Therefore, we can check:

             for i in [0, n-2]:
                 if a_{i+1} != a_i+1:   [so we broke some ones at step i]
                    then we must have that i+1 < n-1? -> then we require that a_{i+2} = a_{i+1} + 1.

          But what if i = n-2? Then we break ones at the last step? Then there is no next term? So no condition.

          Therefore, we require:

             for i from 0 to n-3:
                 if a_{i+1} != a_i+1, then a_{i+2} must be a_{i+1} + 1.

      Now, we have:

          Conditions:

            (1) For every i in [0, n-2]: a_{i+1} is in [1, a_i+1]? Actually, we must allow a_{i+1}=0? But condition (1) above: if a_i=0 then we must have a_{i+1}=1. So a_{i+1} cannot be 0? Actually, if the entire sequence has only one element, then a0 can be 0. But if n>=2, then the first element might be 0 and then the next must be 1.

            Actually, the condition for consecutive terms:

                 a_{i+1} must be between max(1, a_i - a_i + 1) and a_i+1 -> which is [1, a_i+1]? 

            However, note: we can have a_{i+1}=0? 

            Let me check: if x_i is a number with popcount a_i, and we break a block of t_i trailing ones, then:

                 a_{i+1} = a_i - t_i + 1.

            Since t_i>=1, then a_{i+1} = a_i - t_i + 1 <= a_i and >= a_i - (a_i) + 1 = 1.

            So a_{i+1} cannot be 0? 

            Therefore, the only term that can be 0 is the first term? But wait: if the first term is 0, then the next must be 1. Then the next can be 0? 

            How? 

                x0: 0 -> p(0)=0 -> then x1=1 -> p(1)=1 -> then x2=2 -> p(2)=1? -> but then we break: 

                   a0=0, a1=1 -> then t0 = 0? because a1=a0+1 -> so trailing ones of 0 is 0? -> valid.

                   Then for x1=1: a1=1, then we need a2: if we have a2=0? then we require t1 = 1 - 0 + 1 = 2 -> but x1=1: which is ...0001 -> trailing ones is 1 -> so t1=1 -> then a2 = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1 -> so we cannot get 0.

            Therefore, the only 0 that can appear is as the first term? Or as a term that is not the first? Actually, we can only get 0 at the first term? Because:

                For i>=0, a_{i+1}>=1.

            Therefore, if the sequence has a 0 at any position that is not the first, it is invalid.

          Condition 3: 
               For i in [0, n-1]: if i>0, then a_i>=1.

      Summary of necessary conditions:

          Condition A: a0 can be any integer in [0,60] (and if n==1, then it's the only one; if n>=2, then a0 can be 0 but then a1 must be 1).

          Condition B: for i from 0 to n-2:
               (i) a_{i+1} must be in [1, a_i+1]   [because if a_i=0 then a_{i+1}=1, and if a_i>=1 then a_{i+1} in [1, a_i] or a_i+1]

          Condition C: for i from 0 to n-3:
               if a_{i+1} != a_i+1, then a_{i+2} must be a_{i+1}+1.

      Now, if the sequence does not satisfy these, we output -1.

      How to compute x?

          We know the trailing ones for each x_i for i from 0 to n-2: t_i = 
               if a_{i+1} == a_i+1 -> 0
               else -> a_i - a_{i+1} + 1

          Then we can reconstruct the bits of x0 (x) from the least significant bit to the most.

          We are going to determine the bits of x0, x0+1, ... in a sliding window? Actually, we can use a greedy approach:

          We know the trailing ones for x0: t0. Then the last t0+1 bits of x0 are fixed: the last t0 bits are ones and the bit at position t0 is zero? Actually, the last t0+1 bits: the highest bit (bit t0) is zero and the lower t0 bits are ones.

          Then x0 mod (2^(t0+1)) = (1<<t0) - 1.

          Then x1 = x0+1: we break the trailing ones -> so x1 mod (2^(t0+1)) = 1<<t0.

          Then we know the trailing ones for x1: t1. How do we get the next bits?

          Actually, for x1, we have the last t0+1 bits: the last t0 bits are zeros and the bit at t0 is one. Then the trailing ones for x1 are the consecutive ones starting from the LSB? But the LSB is 0 -> so the trailing ones are 0? Therefore, we must have t1=0? 

          But wait: condition C says that after a step that broke ones (t0>=1), the next term must be a2 = a1+1 -> which implies t1=0. So condition C guarantees that.

          Then for x1: we have trailing ones t1=0 -> then the last bit of x1 must be 0? Actually, no: we just saw that the last bit of x1 is 0. Then we have:

             The last t0+1 bits of x1: we know: ... (higher bits) 1 0...0 (t0 zeros). Then we want to set the next bit? Actually, we don't know beyond the t0+1 bits.

          How do we get the next part?

          Actually, we are going to reconstruct the entire number x0 by determining the bits that are set. We note that the representation of x0 might be long, but we are only concerned with the bits that are involved in the popcount and the trailing ones. However, the trailing ones we break might extend beyond the window we have considered? 

          We can use a state that tracks:

            - the current position (bit index) we are considering
            - the current value of x0 modulo some base? But the numbers can be huge.

          Alternate approach: we can reconstruct the bits in a backward manner? Or we can use a constraint system.

          Insight: the entire sequence of operations fixes the lower L bits of x0, where L is the maximum bit we have set so far? But we break at the next zero? 

          We know:

             x0: has the form ... 0 1...1 (t0 ones) -> so the last t0+1 bits are fixed.

          Then x1 = x0+1: ... 1 0...0 (t0 zeros). Then the next number x2 = x1+1: ... 1 0...01? Actually, we break the trailing zeros: the last bit becomes 1? So we have:

             x1: ... A 1 0...0   (where A is the part above the t0+1 bits) -> then x1+1: ... A 1 0...01? -> no: we break the trailing zeros: we set the last zero to one? So we get ... A 1 0...0 with the last zero set to one? Actually, no: adding one to ...100..0 (t0 zeros) gives ...100..01? No, it gives ...100..0 + 1 = ...100..01? That is not correct: we break the trailing zeros: we set the last bit to one -> then we get ...1 0...01? Actually, the last bit becomes one and the rest of the zeros remain? So we get ...1 0...01 -> then the trailing ones of x1 is 0, so the next step (x2) must be x1+1 = ...1 0...01 + 1 = ...1 0...10? -> then the trailing ones of x2 is 0? Then the next step: ...1 0...10 + 1 = ...1 0...11 -> trailing ones=2? Then ...1 0...11+1 = ...1 1...00 -> trailing ones=0? 

          This is getting messy.

      Another idea: we can represent x0 modulo M, where M is a modulus that covers the bits that are fixed by the entire sequence.

          How many bits do we need to fix? 

          Consider: the entire sequence of n numbers, we break trailing ones at each step. The maximum bit we set might be the maximum of the positions we break? 

          Actually, when we break a block of t_i ones, we set the next bit to one. That next bit is at position = (the position of the first zero we meet) = at least t_i bits above the LSB? 

          The maximum bit we might touch is bounded by the maximum value of t_i? But t_i can be up to 60? And we have n up to 500,000, so we might set a bit at position up to 500,000? That is too high.

      However, note the condition: after breaking a block of t_i ones, the next step must be an increment by one (so we set the last bit to one and then the next step breaks nothing). Therefore, the only time we carry beyond the current block is when we break a block? And then we set a bit at the next higher position? 

          Actually, the entire sequence of breaks: we break at step0: t0 ones -> then we set a bit at position t0. Then the next step: we have a trailing zero? Then we set the last bit to one? Then we break nothing until we get to the bit at position t0? 

          How many bits do we need to represent x? 

          The maximum bit we set is the maximum of the positions where we break a block? And the positions are the cumulative sum of the t_i's? 

          Actually, the positions are independent? 

          Example: 
              n=3: [3,2,3] -> 
                 t0 = 2 -> then we set a bit at position 2? Then the next step: we break nothing -> then we set bit0 to one? Then the next step: we break the block that includes the bit at position2? Actually, no: the next step we have:

                 x0: ...0 11 -> then x1: ...1 00 -> then x2: ...1 01 -> then we don't break any block beyond the first two bits.

          Therefore, the bits we set are at positions 0 to max(t_i)? But wait, when we break t_i ones, we set a bit at position t_i? Then later we might break a block that includes that bit? 

          Actually, the next time we break a block that is above the current block? We break the entire block including the bit we set? 

          How many bits do we need to represent? 

          The highest bit that is set by the entire sequence is the maximum value of the cumulative offset? 

          We can have multiple breaks: 

            Step0: break t0 ones -> we set a bit at position t0.
            Then we do t0 steps of increment without carry (each step sets a bit and breaks nothing) -> then we get to the next break: when we break the block that includes the bit at position t0.

            How? 

              After step0: x0 has the form: ... A 0 1...1 (t0 ones) -> then x1 = ... A 1 0...0.

              Then we do t0 steps of increment: 
                 x1: ... A 1 0...0
                 x2: ... A 1 0...1
                 x3: ... A 1 0...10
                 ...
                 until we get to x_{1+t0}: ... A 1 1...1   -> then the next step: x_{1+t0}+1 = ... (A+1) 0...0 -> then we break a block of ones that starts at the bit at position t0 and extends upward? 

          So the next break (if any) would be at a block that is at least t0+1 bits long? 

          Therefore, the breaks can happen at positions: t0, t0+t1, ... etc.

          The total offset is the sum of the t_i for the breaks? 

          But note: condition C says that after a break, we must have an increment in the next popcount? But then what about the next break? 

          Actually, condition C only forces the immediate next step to be an increment by one? It does not prevent a break two steps after? 

          However, after a break at step i (with t_i ones), the next step (i+1) is not a break (so we have an increment by one in popcount) and then at step i+2, we might have a break? 

          How? 

             Step i: x_i: ...0 1...1 -> then x_{i+1}= ...1 0...0 -> then x_{i+2}= ...1 0...01 -> popcount: the ... part plus 1 (for the bit at position t_i) plus the new one? -> so a_{i+2}= a_{i+1} + 1? -> so we cannot have a break at step i+1? 

          But at step i+2: we have x_{i+2}= ...1 0...01 -> then we add one: ...1 0...10 -> popcount: same as ...1 0...01? -> we added one and removed one? So a_{i+3}=a_{i+2}? -> then we break a block? 

          Actually, the trailing ones of x_{i+2} are 1? -> then t_{i+2}= a_{i+2} - a_{i+3} + 1.

          But we require that if we break at step i+2, then the next term a_{i+4} must be a_{i+3}+1.

          So breaks can happen at any step as long as they are not immediately after a break? 

          The breaks can happen at steps that are at least one step after a break? 

          Therefore, the breaks are separated by at least one step.

          The total number of breaks is at most n, and the positions of the breaks are the cumulative sums of the t_i's? 

          The highest bit we touch is the maximum cumulative sum? 

          And the cumulative sum might be up to 60 * (number of breaks) -> and the number of breaks is at most n/2? -> 250,000, so the highest bit might be 60*250,000 which is 15,000,000? -> that is too high to represent explicitly.

      Therefore, we need a different approach.

      Insight: the entire sequence of breaks and the values of t_i determine the value of x0 modulo a very large modulus? 

          Specifically, after each break, we fix a block of bits. The breaks are independent? 

          The breaks happen at positions: 
              break0: fixes the block [0, t0] (inclusive): the last t0+1 bits.
              break1: happens at a position at least t0+1? and fixes a block that starts at the next available bit? 

          Actually, the breaks can overlap? 

          Let the break0 fix the bits from 0 to t0. Then the next break, say break1, happens at a later step and fixes a block that includes bit t0 and beyond? 

          Specifically, when we break break0, we set bit t0 to one and clear bits 0..t0-1 to zeros. Then we do a series of increments until we get to the next break. The next break will happen when we set bits 0..t0-1 to ones again and then carry into bit t0? Then we break a block that includes bit t0? 

          How many bits do we need to represent x0? 

          The value of x0 is determined by the constraints:

            At break0: x0 mod 2^(t0+1) = (1<<t0) - 1.

            At break1: which occurs at a later step, say at step k, we have:

                   x0 + k = ...0 1...1   (with t_k ones) -> so x0+k mod 2^(t_k+1) = (1<<t_k)-1.

          But k might be large? 

          Actually, the breaks are not independent in time? 

      Alternate approach: use the known necessary conditions to filter, and then for valid sequences, we can compute x by solving a system of equations? 

          We know:

            For each break (at step i), we have:

                x_i = ...0 1...1   -> so x_i = some value mod 2^(t_i+1) = (1<<t_i) - 1.

            And x_i = x0 + i.

            Therefore, we have:

                x0 + i = (1<<t_i) - 1   mod 2^(t_i+1)

          But also, if there is no break at step i, then we don't have a constraint? 

          Actually, we have constraints only at the steps where we break (i.e., t_i>=1). 

          And we have multiple breaks? 

          The breaks are at indices i such that a_{i+1} != a_i+1.

          Therefore, we can collect a set of equations:

               x0 + i â‰¡ (1<<t_i) - 1   (mod 2^(t_i+1))

          Then we want the smallest nonnegative x0 that satisfies all these equations.

          This is a system of linear congruences? 

          How to solve? 

            We can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) if the moduli are coprime? But here the moduli are powers of 2? and they might not be coprime? 

          Example: breaks at i and j, with t_i and t_j.

            modulus_i = 2^(t_i+1)
            modulus_j = 2^(t_j+1)

          The system:

               x0 â‰¡ ( (1<<t_i)-1 - i ) mod 2^(t_i+1)
               x0 â‰¡ ( (1<<t_j)-1 - j ) mod 2^(t_j+1)

          The solution exists if the two congruences are compatible modulo the gcd of the two moduli.

          Since both moduli are powers of 2, the gcd is 2^(min(t_i+1, t_j+1)).

          Therefore, we require that the two congruences are the same modulo 2^(min(t_i+1, t_j+1)).

          Then we can combine the moduli by taking the least common multiple, which is 2^(max(t_i+1, t_j+1))? 

          We can solve by iteratively merging the congruences.

          Steps:

             Let x0 â‰¡ a (mod m) initially: no constraint -> a=0, m=1.

             For each break at index i (with t_i>=1):

                 Let M = 2^(t_i+1)
                 Let A = ( (1<<t_i) - 1 - i ) mod M   [if negative, adjust modulo]

                 Then we need:

                    x0 â‰¡ A (mod M)

                 Then we merge this with the current solution:

                    We have: x0 â‰¡ a (mod m) and x0 â‰¡ A (mod M)

                    We want to find x0 that satisfies both.

                    Since the moduli are powers of 2, we can do:

                    Let g = gcd(m, M) = 2^(min( exponent of 2 in m, exponent of 2 in M )).

                    But note: m is a power of 2? because we start with m=1 and then we merge with powers of 2 -> so m is 2^k for some k.

                    Similarly, M=2^(t_i+1). So g = 2^(min(k, t_i+1)).

                    Then we require that a mod g = A mod g.

                    If not, then there is no solution.

                    If yes, then we can merge:

                         We want x0 mod lcm(m, M) = mod (2^(max(k, t_i+1))).

                         How to find the solution?

                         Let x0 = a + m * t, and we want:

                                a + m * t â‰¡ A (mod M)

                         =>   m * t â‰¡ A - a (mod M)

                         Since m is a power of 2 and M is a power of 2, we can divide the equation by g? 

                         Actually, we can write:

                                t â‰¡ (A - a) * inv(m) (mod M/gcd(m,M))? 

                         But note: m and M are powers of 2, and m might be divisible by g, and M by g? 

                         Alternatively, we can note that m is 2^k, and M=2^l, with l = t_i+1.

                         Without loss of generality, assume k <= l.

                         Then the equation:

                                2^k * t â‰¡ A - a (mod 2^l)

                         =>   t â‰¡ (A - a) / 2^k   (mod 2^(l-k))   [because we can divide by 2^k since the modulus is divisible by 2^k?]

                         But note: we require that (A - a) is divisible by 2^k? -> that is the condition we already checked (a mod 2^min(k,l) = A mod 2^min(k,l)).

                         Then we set:

                                t0 = (A - a) >> k

                         and then t can be written as: t = t0 + s * 2^(l-k) for integer s.

                         Then x0 = a + m * (t0 + s * 2^(l-k)) = a + m * t0 + s * (m * 2^(l-k)) = a + m*t0 + s * (2^k * 2^(l-k)) = a + m*t0 + s * 2^l.

                         Then we set:

                                a' = a + m * t0
                                m' = 2^l   (because we are now working mod 2^l)

          Algorithm:

            Let a = 0, m = 1.

            For each break at index i (with t_i>=1) in increasing order of i? 

            Actually, we can process breaks in any order? But note: the modulus for each break is 2^(t_i+1). We should process in increasing order of the exponent? 

            Why? Because if we have a break with a large modulus, and then a break with a small modulus, then when we merge the small modulus we might not have enough information to ensure the large modulus constraint? 

            Actually, we should process in increasing order of the modulus? Or not? 

            Alternatively, we can process in increasing order of i? 

            But note: the breaks might be at arbitrary indices.

            We'll collect all breaks: the indices i for which a_{i+1} != a_i+1.

            Then for each break i:

                 M = 1 << (t_i+1)   [2^(t_i+1)]
                 A = ((1 << t_i) - 1 - i) % M   [if negative, we can do: A = (A mod M + M) % M]

            Then we merge the congruence:

                 x0 â‰¡ A (mod M)

            with the current solution (a, m) as described.

            Steps for merging:

                 Let g = min(m, M)? Actually, we are working with powers of 2. Let:

                    k = exponent of m: so m = 2^k.
                    l = t_i+1 -> M = 2^l.

                 Condition: a mod (2^min(k,l)) must equal A mod (2^min(k,l)).

                 If not, return no solution.

                 Else, let:

                    if k <= l:
                         then we can express: 
                              x0 = a + m * t   [with t being an integer]
                         and we require: a + m*t â‰¡ A (mod 2^l)

                         => 2^k * t â‰¡ A - a (mod 2^l)

                         Since 2^k divides the modulus? we can divide the entire equation by 2^k:

                         => t â‰¡ ( (A - a) / 2^k )   (mod 2^(l-k))

                         So we set:

                              t0 = (A - a) >> k   [since A - a is divisible by 2^k by the condition]

                         Then x0 = a + m * t0   is a solution modulo 2^l? Actually, modulo 2^l? 

                         Then we update:

                              a = a + m * t0
                              m = 1 << l   [=2^l]

                    if k > l:
                         then the current modulus m is 2^k which is divisible by M=2^l. 
                         Then the condition a mod 2^l = A must hold? (which we already checked: a mod 2^l = A mod 2^l = A) -> so we don't need to update a? 
                         But we leave a and m unchanged? 

                         Actually, we have: 
                            x0 â‰¡ a (mod 2^k)  => x0 â‰¡ a (mod 2^l) [because 2^l divides 2^k] 
                            and we require x0 â‰¡ A (mod 2^l) -> and we have a â‰¡ A (mod 2^l) -> so the congruence is satisfied.

                         Therefore, we do nothing.

            After processing all breaks, we have a solution modulo m. Then we want the smallest nonnegative x0 that satisfies the entire sequence? 

            But note: there might be breaks that are not independent? and we also have the condition that the popcount of x0, x0+1, ... must match the sequence.

            However, we have only used the constraints from the breaks? 

            How do we know that the entire sequence is satisfied? 

            We know the necessary conditions are satisfied (the consecutive constraints and the break constraints) and we have fixed the bits at the break points? 

            But we have not checked the popcount of the entire sequence? 

            How expensive is it to compute the popcount for x0 to x0+n-1? 

            n can be up to 500,000 -> and x0 can be huge (like 2^60) -> we cannot compute popcount for 500,000 consecutive numbers by converting to binary? 

            Therefore, we must rely on the necessary conditions and the break constraints to ensure the entire sequence? 

            Actually, the necessary conditions we derived are also sufficient? 

            But we have one more thing: the value of x0 we get must have at each step the popcount as given? 

            However, the breaks are determined by the sequence and we fixed the bits at the break points? 

            How about the bits that are not in any break? 

            The breaks are the steps where we had a carry? and the other steps are simple increments that set a bit in the low part that we already fixed? 

            Actually, the value of x0 we get from the CRT system should be the only candidate? 

            But note: there might be multiple solutions modulo the combined modulus. Then we choose the smallest nonnegative solution? 

            However, we must check the entire sequence? 

            But the problem: the total n is 500,000 -> but we cannot simulate 500,000 consecutive numbers for each test case? 

            Alternative: we don't have to check, because the breaks and the necessary conditions guarantee the popcount? 

            Actually, the popcount is determined by the relation:

                  p(x0+i) = a_i   for i=0,...,n-1.

            And the breaks and the necessary conditions for the sequence are designed to match the recurrence. 

            Therefore, if we have a solution to the CRT system, then it must satisfy the entire sequence? 

            Why? 

               The recurrence:

                  p(x0) = a0   [we haven't fixed this by the breaks, but we can compute it?]

            Actually, we have not fixed the higher bits? 

          How to ensure that the popcount of x0 is a0? 

          The breaks only fix the lower bits? The higher bits are arbitrary? 

          Therefore, we must also require that the popcount of the candidate x0 is a0? and similarly for x0+1, ...? 

          But we cannot compute the popcount for huge x0? 

      Insight: the popcount of a number is the sum of the popcount of the fixed lower bits and the popcount of the higher bits? 

          But the higher bits are not fixed? 

          Actually, in the CRT solution, the value x0 we get is fixed modulo the combined modulus (which is 2^L, where L is the maximum of the exponents we merged). Then we can write:

                x0 = a0' + k * (2^L)

          Then the popcount of x0 is the popcount of a0' plus the popcount of k? 

          But note: the higher bits (above L) are not constrained by the breaks? 

          Therefore, to minimize x0, we would take k=0? so x0 = a0'? 

          Then we can compute the popcount of x0, x0+1, ... for the candidate x0 = a0'? 

          But n can be 500,000 and a0' can be huge? (like 2^60) but we have the combined modulus as 2^L, and L might be 60? 

          Actually, the maximum exponent L we get is the maximum of the (t_i+1) over the breaks? and t_i<=60, so L<=61.

          Then the candidate x0 we get from the CRT system is in the range [0, 2^L - 1]? Actually, we have a solution modulo 2^L, and we take the smallest nonnegative one: a0' in [0, 2^L-1]. Then we set k=0 -> x0 = a0'. 

          But wait: could there be a solution with k>0 that is smaller? 

          Actually, the solution we get from the CRT is the smallest nonnegative solution modulo the combined modulus? 

          Then we have x0 = a0' (which is in [0, 2^L-1]).

          Then we can compute the popcount for x0, x0+1, ... x0+n-1? 

          How? 

            Since L is at most 61, and n can be up to 500,000, we note that x0+n-1 < 2^L + n. But 2^L is about 2^61 which is around 2e18, and n=500,000 -> then x0+n-1 is about 2e18+500000, which is huge? 

          How to compute the popcount of a huge number? 

          We cannot convert the number to binary? 

          Alternative: use bit-level arithmetic to compute the popcount without building the entire binary representation? 

          But we can use the built-in __builtin_popcount for 64-bit integers? 

          However, note: x0 might be 2^61 which is beyond 64 bits? Actually, 2^61 is 2e18, and 2^64 is 1.8e19, so 2^61 fits in 64 bits? 

          Actually, 2^64 is about 1.8e19, and 2^61 is 2.3e18, which is less than 2^64? 

          But x0+n-1 might be 2^61 + 500000 < 2^61 + 2^20, which still fits in 64 bits? 

          However, the problem says: "the smallest x" for the second sample is 2305843009213693949 which is about 2^61, so we are dealing with 64-bit integers.

          Therefore, we can compute the popcount for each consecutive number from x0 to x0+n-1 if we represent them as 64-bit integers? 

          But n can be 500,000 -> 500,000 numbers -> then we do 500,000 popcounts? 

          How to compute popcount for a 64-bit integer? 

             We can use: 
                 __builtin_popcountll(x)

          And the total work per test case: O(n) -> but the sum of n across test cases is 500,000, so we can do at most 500,000 popcounts? 

          However, note: the problem has t test cases, and the total n is 500,000, so we can do:

             for each test case: 
                 n = ... 
                 then we iterate for j from 0 to n-1: 
                     check p(x0+j) == a_j?

          Then the total work is 500,000 * (cost of popcount for one number) -> which is acceptable because the cost of popcountll is O(1) (it uses a hardware instruction).

          Therefore, the plan:

            Step 1: Pre-check the necessary conditions for the entire sequence:

                Condition A: for i>=1, a_i>=1? 
                Condition B: for i in [0, n-2]: 
                    if a_{i+1} is not in [1, a_i+1] -> output -1.

                Condition C: for i in [0, n-3]:
                    if a_{i+1} != a_i+1, then check a_{i+2} == a_{i+1}+1? -> if not, output -1.

            Step 2: Collect the breaks: for i in [0, n-2] (we don't need the last step? because the last step has no next popcount? actually, the break at step i (for i from 0 to n-2) is defined only for the next popcount) 

                For i from 0 to n-2:
                    if a_{i+1} == a_i+1: 
                         t_i = 0 -> skip (not a break)
                    else: 
                         t_i = a_i - a_{i+1} + 1   -> and we know 1<=t_i<=a_i (guaranteed by condition B? because a_{i+1} in [1, a_i] -> then t_i in [1, a_i])

            Step 3: Solve the system of congruences for the breaks:

                Let a = 0, m = 1 (exponent k=0).

                For each break i (in increasing order of i? Actually, the modulus does not depend on i, but we process in arbitrary order? But we must be consistent: we'll process in increasing order of i? Actually, the order does not matter because the CRT for powers of 2 is commutative? 

                However, we can process in any order? But the modulus might be different? 

                Actually, we want to combine the constraints? 

                Alternatively, we can process in increasing order of the exponent (t_i+1) to minimize the exponent? Or in increasing order of the modulus? 

                But the algorithm above for merging works for any order? 

                However, we must note: when we merge, we set the modulus to the maximum of the exponents? 

                We'll process the breaks in increasing order of i? 

                For each break i:

                    M = 1LL << (t_i+1)   [use 1LL to avoid overflow]
                    A = ( (1LL << t_i) - 1 - i ) % M;
                    if (A < 0) A += M;

                    Now, we have: 
                         current modulus m = 2^k, and we have x0 â‰¡ a (mod 2^k)
                         and we require x0 â‰¡ A (mod M) where M=2^l, l = t_i+1.

                    Then:

                         Let l = t_i+1.

                         Condition: a mod (1<<min(k,l)) == A mod (1<<min(k,l))

                    If not, return no solution.

                    Else, update:

                         if k <= l:
                              t0 = (A - a) >> k;   // because (A-a) is divisible by (1<<k) -> then we can shift
                              a = a + m * t0;
                              m = 1LL << l;   // update modulus to 2^l
                         else: // k>l, then we don't need to update a and m? because the current modulus is already stronger.

            Step 4: Then we have a candidate x0 = a (the smallest nonnegative solution modulo m). But note: there might be a solution with k>=0? Actually, we have taken the smallest nonnegative solution modulo the combined modulus. Then we set x0 = a.

            Step 5: Check the entire sequence: 
                    for j from 0 to n-1:
                         if p(x0+j) != a_j, then we break.

            But what if there is a smaller solution? 

            Actually, we have taken the smallest nonnegative solution modulo m, and any other solution is of the form x0 + k * m (k>=0). Therefore, we start with x0 = a, and if it fails, we try the next solution: a + m, then a+2m, ... until we find one? 

            But the problem: we are to find the smallest x.

            However, note: the next solution a+m might be huge? and we cannot iterate over k? 

            But we know that the modulus m is 2^L (with L at most 61) and the candidate a is in [0, m-1]. Then we try:

                candidate = a, then a+m, then a+2m, ... until we have a candidate that satisfies the entire sequence? 

            How many candidates do we need to try? 

            We require that the sequence of popcounts matches. 

            The popcounts are periodic? 

            Actually, the sequence of popcounts for x, x+1, ... x+n-1 might not be periodic? 

            But note: the breaks are fixed by the constraints? 

            However, the condition we used to build the congruences are necessary for the breaks? but the higher bits might affect the popcount? 

            How? 

                The value x0 = a + k*m: then the lower L bits are fixed? and the higher bits (above L) are k? 

                Then the popcount of x0+j is: popcount( (k) ) + popcount( a+j mod m )? 

                But wait: when we add j, it might carry into the higher bits? 

            Therefore, we cannot split the popcount as the sum of the popcount of the high part and the low part? 

            How to check without iterating k? 

            We note: the modulus m is 2^L, and L is at least as large as the highest break position? 

            Then when j is in [0, n-1], we have (a+j) < m + n? 

            Since m is 2^L and L>= the maximum break position, then the carry from the lower L bits to the higher bits (the k part) occurs only when a+j >= m? 

            Then we can split:

               For j such that a+j < m: 
                   x0+j = k * m + (a+j)   -> popcount = p(k) + p(a+j)

               For j such that a+j >= m:
                   x0+j = (k+1) * m + (a+j - m)   -> popcount = p(k+1) + p(a+j - m)

            Therefore, the popcount of x0+j is:

                 if a+j < m: p(k) + p(a+j)
                 else: p(k+1) + p(a+j - m)

            And we require this to be a_j.

            Then for a fixed k, we can compute the entire sequence of popcounts? 

            How expensive? 

                We can precompute the popcount for the lower part: for j in [0, n-1] we compute:

                   if a+j < m: 
                         value = a+j, then popcount = __builtin_popcountll(value)
                   else:
                         value = a+j - m, then popcount = __builtin_popcountll(value)

                Then we need the popcount of k and k+1? 

            But k is a nonnegative integer? and we want the smallest x0? 

            How to find the smallest k such that:

                 For all j in [0, n-1]:
                    if a+j < m: then p(k) + p(a+j) = a_j
                    else: then p(k+1) + p(a+j-m) = a_j

            We can try k=0, then k=1, then k=2, ...? 

            But k is the higher part, and we don't know how big k might be? 

            Note: the popcount p(k) and p(k+1) are bounded by about 60? So k cannot be too large? 

            Actually, k is the quotient, and we want the smallest x0, so we start with k=0, then k=1, etc.

            How many k do we try? 

                The condition: the entire sequence must be satisfied.

                The values p(k) and p(k+1) are nonnegative integers. 

                But note: the entire sequence a_j is fixed. 

                For j in the range [0, n-1] such that a+j >= m, we have:

                    a_j = p(k+1) + p(a+j-m)

                and for j such that a+j < m:

                    a_j = p(k) + p(a+j)

                Therefore, if there is at least one j such that a+j>=m, then we have:

                    p(k+1) = a_j - p(a+j-m)

                and similarly for the other j.

                Since a_j and p(a+j-m) are known, then p(k+1) is fixed? 

                Similarly, if there is at least one j such that a+j<m, then p(k) is fixed? 

                But note: it might be that the entire sequence j in [0, n-1] has a+j < m? Then we don't have any constraint on k+1? 

            Therefore, we can deduce:

                Let c0 = p(k) and c1 = p(k+1).

                Then for every j:

                    if a+j < m: a_j = c0 + p(a+j)
                    if a+j>=m: a_j = c1 + p(a+j-m)

                Then we can compute:

                    For j in the lower part: 
                         c0 = a_j - p(a+j)   [must be the same for all j in the lower part?]

                    For j in the upper part:
                         c1 = a_j - p(a+j-m)   [must be the same for all j in the upper part?]

                And also, we have the relation: p(k+1) = p(k) + 1 - t, where t is the number of trailing ones in k? 

                But we don't know the trailing ones? 

                Actually, we have:

                    p(k+1) = p(k) - t + 1, where t is the number of trailing ones in k.

                And we know c0 and c1? then we have:

                    c1 = c0 - t + 1   => t = c0 - c1 + 1.

                And t must be between 1 and c0? 

            Therefore, the algorithm:

                Step 5.1: Precompute the lower part: for j from 0 to n-1:

                    Let low_j = a+j
                    If low_j < m: 
                         p_low = __builtin_popcountll(low_j)
                    Else:
                         p_low = __builtin_popcountll(low_j - m)

                Then we require:

                    For j in the set S0 (where a+j < m): 
                         c0 = a_j - p_low   [must be the same for all j in S0?]

                    For j in the set S1 (where a+j>=m):
                         c1 = a_j - p_low   [must be the same for all j in S1?]

                If the set S0 is nonempty, then let c0 = a_j - p_low for the first j in S0, and check that for every j in S0, a_j - p_low == c0.

                Similarly for S1: c1 must be the same.

                Then we require:

                    If both sets are nonempty, then we must have: 
                         c1 = c0 - t + 1   for some integer t in [1, c0]? 
                         => t = c0 - c1 + 1 must be between 1 and c0.

                    Also, if we have only S0, then we don't have c1? -> then we cannot determine c1? 

                    But note: if S1 is empty, then we don't require anything about c1? 

                    Similarly, if we have only S1, then we don't have c0.

                However, we also know that k and k+1 must be nonnegative integers with popcounts c0 and c1? 

                And k must be chosen so that:

                    p(k) = c0   and   p(k+1)=c1.

                And we know that c1 = p(k+1) must be either c0+1 or c0 - t + 1 for some t in [1, c0]. 

                But we don't know the exact k? 

                How to find the smallest k that satisfies:

                    p(k)=c0 and p(k+1)=c1?

                We can iterate k? -> but k can be large? 

                Alternatively, we can use the necessary conditions:

                    If we have both c0 and c1, then we require:

                         either (c1 = c0+1) OR (c1 <= c0) and then the trailing ones condition: t = c0 - c1 + 1 must be between 1 and c0.

                    But note: the relation between p(k) and p(k+1) is fixed: 

                         if k is even: then p(k+1)=p(k)+1 -> so c1 = c0+1.

                         if k is odd: then p(k+1)=p(k) - t + 1, where t is the number of trailing ones in k.

                    Therefore, if we have both c0 and c1, then the conditions must be satisfied.

                Then we can find the smallest k such that:

                    p(k)=c0 and p(k+1)=c1.

                How? 

                    The smallest k with p(k)=c0 is (1<<c0) - 1.

                    Then we check: p(k+1)=p( (1<<c0)-1 + 1 ) = p(1<<c0) = 1.

                    But that is not necessarily c1.

                We can iterate over k? 

                The number of k with popcount c0 is huge? 

            Alternative: we don't need to iterate k? We want the smallest x0 = k * m + a.

            How to minimize x0? 

                We want to minimize k? 

                The smallest k that satisfies:

                    p(k)=c0   and   (if there is an S1, then p(k+1)=c1)

                But if there is no S1, then we only require p(k)=c0 -> the smallest k is (1<<c0)-1.

                If there is S1, then we require p(k)=c0 and p(k+1)=c1.

                How to find the smallest k with p(k)=c0 and p(k+1)=c1? 

                    We can iterate k starting from the smallest candidate for k with popcount c0? 

                    The smallest k with popcount c0 is (1<<c0)-1.

                    Then we check k, k+1: 

                         p(k) = c0? 
                         p(k+1) = c1?

                    Then we try the next k? 

                    The next k: the next number with popcount c0? 

                How many k do we try? 

                    The number of k we try is the smallest k that satisfies the condition? 

                    The condition might be satisfied for k = (1<<c0)-1? 

                    But if not, then the next k? 

                How to generate the next number with popcount c0? 

                    We can use a method to generate numbers with a fixed popcount? 

                But note: c0 is at most 60? so k is at most 2^60? -> we cannot iterate.

            Insight: the condition p(k+1)=c1 and p(k)=c0 is equivalent to:

                    p(k+1) = 
                         if k is even: c0+1
                         if k is odd: c0 - t + 1   (where t is the number of trailing ones in k)

                Therefore, we have:

                    if we require c1 = c0+1, then k must be even.

                    if we require c1 <= c0, then k must be odd and the trailing ones t = c0 - c1 + 1.

            Then we can construct the smallest k:

                Case 1: if we only have S0 (no S1), then we set k to be the smallest number with popcount c0: (1<<c0)-1.

                Case 2: if we have S1 (and possibly S0) and we have both c0 and c1, then:

                    Option A: if c1 = c0+1, then k must be even and have popcount c0.

                         The smallest even number with popcount c0: 
                             if c0==0 -> then k=0 -> but then k+1=1 -> popcount=1 = c1 -> works.
                             if c0>=1: 
                                 we cannot use the smallest number (1<<c0)-1) because it is odd? (if c0>=1, then the last bit is 1) -> then the next candidate: 
                                 we want an even number: the last bit must be 0? but then we need to have c0 ones in the higher bits.

                                 The smallest even number with popcount c0: 
                                    set the last bit to 0, and then the next c0 bits to 1? -> but that is ( (1<<c0) - 1 ) << 1? -> popcount is c0 and it is even.

                                 But we can do better? 

                                 Actually, the smallest even number: we can set the lowest bit to 0 and then the next c0 bits to 1? -> that is ( (1<<c0) - 1 ) << 1.

                                 But we can have: 
                                    k = (1 << c0) - 2? -> if c0==1: then 1-2 = -1 -> invalid.

                                 Actually, the smallest even number with popcount c0: 
                                    we have to have at least one one in the higher bits? 

                                 Consider: 
                                    c0=1: then the even numbers with one one: 10, 100, 1000, ... -> the smallest is 10 (binary) = 2.

                                    c0=2: then 110, 1010, 1100, ... -> the smallest is 110? 6? -> but 6 has popcount 2 and is even.

                                 Actually, the smallest even number with popcount c0 is (1<<c0) | (1<<0))? -> no, that is 1<<c0 + 1, which is odd.

                                 How about: 
                                    k = (1<<c0) - 1 + 1? -> that is 1<<c0 -> popcount=1, not c0.

                                 Another idea: 
                                    k = (1<< (c0)) - 1 - 1 + (1<<something)? 

                                 Alternatively, we can use a known method: next number with same popcount? 

                                 We want the smallest even number with popcount c0? 

                                 We can start from the smallest number with popcount c0: (1<<c0)-1, which is odd. Then we want the next even number? 

                                 But the next even number might be (1<<c0)-1 + 1? -> (1<<c0), which has popcount 1.

                                 Then we have to find the next even number that has popcount c0? 

                                 We can use: 
                                    k = (1<<c0) - 1   -> then the next number with popcount c0 and even? 

                                 Algorithm for next number with same popcount: 

                                    Example: c0=2: 
                                        smallest: 3 (11) -> then next: 5 (101) -> but 5 is odd? then next: 6 (110) -> even -> so k=6.

                                 But we want even numbers? 

                                 We can skip the odd ones? 

                                 However, the smallest even number might be constructed as: 
                                    the binary number: 0...0 1 1 ... 1 0   (with c0 ones and then a trailing zero) -> the value is ( (1<<c0)-1 ) << 1.

                                 And that has popcount c0 and is even.

                                 And it is the smallest? 

                                 Because any even number with popcount c0 must have at least c0+1 bits? and the value is (1<< (c0+1)) - 2? 

                                 Actually: ( (1<<c0)-1 ) << 1 = (1<<c0) - 2.

                                 Is there a smaller even number? 

                                 For c0=1: 
                                    (1<<1)-1 = 1 -> then <<1 -> 2 -> which is 10 -> popcount=1 -> and it's even.

                                 For c0=2: 3<<1 = 6, which is 110 -> popcount=2.

                                 For c0=3: 7<<1 = 14, which is 1110 -> popcount=3.

                                 And it is the smallest? 

                                    Any even number with popcount c0 must have at least c0 ones? and the smallest one is indeed having the ones consecutive at the top and then a zero at the end.

                    Option B: if c1 = c0 - t + 1 for some t in [1, c0] (and we have t = c0-c1+1), then k must be of the form:

                         ... 0 1...1   (with t ones at the end) -> then k = some number that has the form: A * 2^(t+1) + (1<<t) - 1 - 1? 

                         Actually, the form is: ... 0 1...1 (t ones) -> so the value mod 2^(t+1) is (1<<t)-1.

                         But then k+1 = ... 1 0...0 -> popcount = p(A)+1? 

                         But we require p(k)=c0 and p(k+1)=c1.

                         How to construct the smallest k? 

                         We want the smallest k that ends with t ones and has popcount c0? 

                         The smallest number with popcount c0 and ending with exactly t ones:

                             The last t+1 bits: 0 followed by t ones? -> but then the entire number must have c0 ones.

                             We can put the remaining c0 - t ones in the higher bits? 

                             The smallest: set the next bits to zeros, and then the next c0-t ones as low as possible.

                             Example: 
                                 c0=3, t=2: 
                                    last 3 bits: 011? -> but that has only 2 ones? -> no, we require the last t+1 bits: we have the last t bits are ones and the bit before is zero.

                                    So the last t+1 bits: 0 followed by t ones -> has popcount t.

                                    Then we need c0-t = 1 one in the higher bits.

                                    The smallest: put a one at the next bit: so the number: ... 0 1 0 1 1? -> but we want the smallest: the last t+1 bits are fixed: 011 (for t=2) and then we put a one at the next available bit? -> 1011? 

                                    But the smallest is 1011? 

                                    But also: 10011, 10101, etc. -> 1011 is 11 in decimal.

                             How to build: 
                                Let the number be: 
                                    [ (1 << (c0-t)) - 1 ] << (t+1)  |  ((1<<t) - 1)

                                But that does not have a zero separating the ones? 

                             Actually, we want the higher bits to be as small as possible? 

                                We need to have c0-t ones in the higher bits (above the last t+1 bits). The last t+1 bits are fixed: 0 followed by t ones? -> but actually, the last t+1 bits are fixed to (1<<t)-1? -> which is a number with t ones and no zero in the last t+1 bits? 

                             Correction: the last t+1 bits: the highest bit of these is the zero, and the lower t are ones. So the value is (1<<t)-1.

                             Then the entire number: 

                                k = (X) * 2^(t+1) + ((1<<t)-1)

                             where X is a number with popcount c0-t.

                             Then the smallest X is the smallest number with popcount c0-t: (1<<(c0-t))-1.

                             Therefore, k = ( (1<<(c0-t))-1 ) << (t+1) + ((1<<t)-1)

                    Then we compare the two options for k (if applicable) and choose the smallest k that satisfies the condition.

            But wait: we have two cases for the relation between c0 and c1? 

                Case 1: c1 = c0+1 -> then k must be even -> then k0 = ( (1<<c0)-1 ) << 1?  [which is (1<<c0)*2 - 2] 

                Case 2: c1 = c0 - t + 1, with t in [1, c0] -> then k1 = ( (1<<(c0-t))-1 ) * (1<<(t+1)) + (1<<t)-1.

            Then we take the minimum of k0 and k1? 

            But note: if both conditions are satisfied, we take the smallest k? 

            However, the condition is determined by the data: if we are in case 1 then we only use case 1, if in case 2 then only case 2.

            Actually, we are in one or the other? 

            Therefore, we can compute k as:

                if we have only S0: then k = (1<<c0)-1.

                else if we have S1 and the condition is c1 = c0+1: then k = (1<<c0)-1 << 1   [but note: we want even and the smallest even, and we argued that (1<<c0)-1<<1 is the smallest even number with popcount c0]

                else if we have S1 and the condition is c1 = c0 - t + 1 for t = c0-c1+1 (and t in [1,c0]): then k = ( (1<<(c0-t))-1 ) << (t+1) | ((1<<t)-1)

            Then x0 = k * m + a.

            But note: we also have the possibility that there is no solution? 

            However, we already built k to satisfy p(k)=c0 and p(k+1)=c1 (if applicable). Then we must check that with this k, the entire sequence is satisfied? 

            But we assumed the splits, so it should be satisfied? 

            But note: we have not checked the entire sequence, only the necessary conditions for the splits? 

            Therefore, we must still check: 
                for j in [0, n-1]:
                    if a+j < m: 
                         if p(k) + p(a+j) != a_j -> fail.
                    else:
                         if p(k+1) + p(a+j-m) != a_j -> fail.

            Then if it fails, we try the next candidate for k? 

            But we constructed the smallest k that has the required popcounts? 

            Why would it fail? 

            It might fail if the higher part is not just the popcount of k and k+1, but the addition of j might cause a carry that we haven't accounted for? 

            However, note: we have defined:

                x0+j = 
                    if a+j < m: k * m + (a+j)  -> popcount = p(k) + p(a+j)   [because there's no carry: the higher bits are k and the lower bits are a+j, and they are in disjoint bits? -> yes, because m=2^L, so the lower L bits are a+j and the higher bits are k]

                if a+j>=m: then k * m + a+j = (k+1) * m + (a+j - m) -> popcount = p(k+1) + p(a+j-m)   [and the bits are disjoint]

            Therefore, it is additive? 

            So it should work.

            Then the algorithm for a test case is:

                Step 1: Check the necessary conditions for the sequence (A, B, C) -> if fails, output -1.

                Step 2: Collect breaks and solve the congruence system for the lower part -> if fails, output -1.

                Step 3: 
                    Let m = combined modulus (a power of 2) and a = the solution modulo m.

                    Then split the indices j in [0, n-1] into:

                         S0: j such that a+j < m
                         S1: j such that a+j>=m   (which means a+j-m is in [0, m-1])

                Step 4: 
                    Compute:
                         For j in S0: 
                             p_low = p(a+j)   [using builtin_popcountll for 64-bit integer]
                             and then c0_j = a_j - p_low
                         For j in S1:
                             p_low = p(a+j-m)
                             c1_j = a_j - p_low

                    Then if S0 is nonempty, let c0 = c0_j for the first j, and check that for every j in S0, c0_j==c0.

                    Similarly, if S1 is nonempty, let c1 = c1_j for the first j, and check that for every j in S1, c1_j==c1.

                    If not, output -1.

                Step 5: 
                    If S0 is nonempty and S1 is nonempty:
                         // We have both c0 and c1.
                         if c1 == c0+1:
                              k = ( (1LL<<c0) - 1 ) << 1;   // even number: (1<<c0)-1 is the smallest with popcount c0, but it's odd, so we shift to get the smallest even?
                         else if c1 <= c0:
                              t = c0 - c1 + 1;
                              if t<1 || t>c0) {
                                 // invalid
                                 output -1;
                              }
                              k = ( (1LL << (c0-t)) - 1 ) << (t+1) | ((1LL << t) - 1);
                         else 
                             output -1;   // because c1 must be either c0+1 or <=c0

                    Else if only S0 is nonempty:
                         k = (1LL << c0) - 1;

                    Else if only S1 is nonempty:
                         // only S1: then we don't have c0? 
                         // But we need k such that p(k+1)=c1, but we don't have a constraint on p(k)? 
                         // However, we know k, and then k+1, but we also know that the entire sequence only depends on k+1? 
                         // But the value of x0 = k*m + a, and for j in S1: 
                         //    x0+j = (k+1)*m + (a+j-m) -> popcount = p(k+1) + p(a+j-m) = c1 + p(a+j-m) = a_j -> so it is satisfied regardless of k? 
                         // But we also have the first part: we don't have any constraint for c0? 
                         // Actually, we don't use k in the lower part? 
                         // So we can choose any k? 
                         // And we want the smallest x0 = k*m + a -> so we take k=0? 
                         // Then check: for j in S1: 
                         //    x0+j = a+j, and we require: 
                         //        p(a+j) = a_j? 
                         //    but our split said: if a+j>=m, then we would use k+1? 
                         //    but if k=0, then x0+j = a+j, and we defined for j in S1: a_j = p(1) + p(a+j-m) = 1 + p(a+j-m) 
                         //    but we computed c1 = a_j - p(a+j-m) = 1, so it holds? 
                         //    but we didn't check p(a+j) for j in S1? 
                         //    Actually, we do not have j in S0, so we don't compute c0? 
                         //    But our formula for the popcount of x0+j for j in S1 is: p(k+1) + p(a+j-m) 
                         //    and we set k=0, then p(0+1)=p(1)=1, and then a_j = 1 + p(a+j-m) -> which is our computed c1=1? 
                         //    but wait: we defined c1 = a_j - p(a+j-m) = 1 for every j in S1? 
                         //    so it holds.

                         // However, we also note: the value of x0 = a, and for j in S1: 
                         //    a+j >= m, so we need to compute: 
                         //        x0+j = a+j, which is >= m, but we use the representation: (k+1)*m + (a+j-m) = 1*m + (a+j-m) = a+j.

                         // So the representation is the same.

                         // Therefore, we can choose k=0.

                         k = 0;

                Step 6: 
                    Then candidate x0 = k * m + a.

                    Then we verify the entire sequence: 
                         for j in [0, n-1]:
                             y = x0 + j;
                             if (y < m) 
                                 p_y = p(k) + p(y);   // but wait: if k==0 and y>=m? we use the other formula? 
                             Actually, we do:

                                 if y < (k+1)*m: 
                                    // then the representation is k and (y - k*m) in the lower part? 
                                    // but note: y = x0+j = k*m + a + j.
                                    // and a+j < m? -> then y < k*m + m = (k+1)*m? 
                                 else: 
                                    // then y = (k+1)*m + (y - (k+1)*m) = (k+1)*m + (a+j - m)   [since y = k*m+a+j]

                                 But we cannot split that way? 

                    Instead, we do:

                         We represent y = x0+j = k*m + a + j.

                         Then we split the number into two parts: the lower L bits (mod m) and the higher part.

                         The lower part: low = (a+j) % m.
                         The higher part: high = k + (a+j) / m.

                         Then the popcount of y = p(high) + p(low).

                    Then we check: if p(high) + p(low) == a_j.

                    But note: we have two cases:

                         If a+j < m: 
                             then (a+j)/m = 0 -> high = k, low = a+j.
                         If a+j>=m:
                             then (a+j)/m = 1 -> high = k+1, low = a+j - m.

                    So we compute:

                         if (a+j < m) 
                             total = __builtin_popcountll(high = k) + __builtin_popcountll(low = a+j);
                         else 
                             total = __builtin_popcountll(high = k+1) + __builtin_popcountll(low = a+j - m);

                    And check total == a_j.

                Step 7: 
                    If the entire sequence matches, then output x0 = k*m + a.

                    If not, then we output -1? 

                    But wait: we might have a candidate with a larger k? 

                    How to get the next candidate? 

                    We might have to try the next k that satisfies the popcount conditions? 

                    For example, if we are in the case with both S0 and S1, and our candidate k fails, then the next candidate k might be the next even number with popcount c0? or the next number of the form for the trailing ones? 

                    But the next candidate k will be at least double? and then x0 will be doubled? 

                    And the probability of failure might be low? 

                    However, the problem: we want the smallest x0. 

                    How many candidates k are there? 

                    In the case with both S0 and S1, we have two types of k: 

                         Type 1: c1 = c0+1 -> then k must be even and have popcount c0. The next candidate after the smallest even would be the next even with popcount c0? 

                         Type 2: c1 = c0 - t + 1 -> then k is of the form: X * 2^(t+1) + ((1<<t)-1) with popcount(X)=c0-t. Then the next candidate would be the next number with popcount c0-t in the higher part? 

                    But we cannot iterate? 

            However, note: the conditions we derived for the entire sequence are necessary and sufficient? 

            And our candidate k is the smallest k that satisfies the popcount conditions? 

            And the lower part a is fixed by the breaks? 

            Then the entire sequence should be satisfied? 

            Why would it fail? 

            Example: 
                We might have a break constraint that was not captured by the congruence system? 

            But the congruence system ensures that at every break i, the lower bits of x_i are the required ones? 

            And the popcount of the entire number is the sum of the popcount of the higher part and the lower part? 

            And we designed k to have the popcount of the higher part match the a_j - p(lower) for the sample j? 

            Therefore, it should be satisfied for all j? 

            So we assume that if the conditions are satisfied and we get a candidate x0, then it works? 

            Then we output x0 = k*m + a.

            But note: it is possible that there is no solution? 

            And we already checked the necessary conditions? 

            However, we must also ensure that the computed c0 and c1 are nonnegative? 

            Steps:

                After step 4: we have c0 and c1 (if applicable). 
                    We require c0 and c1 to be nonnegative? 
                    For j in S0: c0 = a_j - p(a+j) -> if a_j < p(a+j), then negative -> fail.
                    Similarly for S1.

            Therefore, we add:

                if (c0 < 0) or (c1 is present and c1<0) -> output -1.

            Also, we require that the computed k is nonnegative and fits in 64 bits? 

            But our k is constructed from c0 and t, and c0<=60, so k is at most around 2^60? which is 64-bit.

            Then we compute x0 = k*m + a, and we know m is at most 2^61, so x0 might be 2^60 * 2^61 = 2^121 -> which is huge? 

            But the problem says: the smallest x, and we output it as a 64-bit integer? 

            The sample: 
                 "2305843009213693949" -> which is 2^61+ something? 

            However, we cannot store 121-bit integer.

            But note: k is at most (1<<c0) which is at most 2^60, and m is at most 2^61, then x0 = k * m + a is about 2^60 * 2^61 = 2^121 -> which is too big for unsigned __int128 in some judges? 

            But the problem: we have to output the number? 

            How did the sample do? 

                The third sample: 
                    n=2, a = [60,60]

                Conditions:

                    Condition B: a1 must be in [1, a0+1] -> 60 in [1,61] -> valid.
                    Condition C: none (n=2, so we only have one consecutive constraint? -> i=0: break? 
                         a1 = 60, a0=60 -> not equal to a0+1 (61) -> so it is a break: t0 = a0 - a1 + 1 = 1.

                Then we solve the congruence:

                    M = 2^(1+1)=4.
                    A = ( (1<<1) - 1 - 0 ) % 4 = (2-1-0)=1 mod4 = 1.

                    Then we start: a=0, m=1 (modulus 1) -> condition: 0 mod 1 == 1 mod 1? both are 0? -> condition holds.

                    Then update: k<=l: k=0, l=2 -> 
                         t0 = (1-0)>>0 = 1.
                         a = 0 + 1*1 = 1.
                         m = 4.

                Then we have: 
                    j=0: a+0=1 < 4 -> S0: 
                         p_low = p(1)=1 -> c0 = a0 - p_low = 60 - 1 = 59.
                    j=1: a+1=2 <4? -> yes, so S0: 
                         p_low = p(2)=1 -> c0 = a1 - p_low = 60-1=59.

                Then we have only S0: so k = (1<<59)-1.

                Then x0 = k*4+1 = ((1<<59)-1)*4+1.

                But the sample output is 2305843009213693949.

                How is that computed? 

                  2305843009213693949 = (2^61 - 2) * 4 + 1? -> no.

                Let me check: 
                  2305843009213693949 in hex?

                Actually, 2^61 = 2305843009213693952.

                Then 2305843009213693949 = 2305843009213693952 - 3.

                And note: (1<<59)-1 = (2^59-1) -> then x0 = (2^59-1)*4 + 1 = 2^61 - 4 + 1 = 2^61 - 3.

                So it matches.

            Therefore, we can compute x0 = k * m + a.

            However, k might be huge: k = (1<<59)-1 -> which is about 2^59, and m=4, then x0 = 2^59*4 = 2^61? -> but we subtract 3 -> and that fits in 64 bits? 

            Actually, 2^61 is about 2.3e18, which fits in unsigned 64-bit integer? 

            But k can be up to 2^60, and m up to 2^61, then k*m is 2^121, which is too big for 64-bit.

            How to avoid overflow? 

            We note: k is at most 2^60? and m is at most 2^61? then k*m is 2^121, which is too big.

            But the sample: k = 2^59-1, m=4 -> then k*m = 2^61 - 4 -> which is about 2.3e18, which fits in unsigned 64-bit? 

            But what if c0=60? 
                k = (1<<60)-1   -> then k is about 2^60, and m could be 2^61? then k*m = 2^121 -> overflow.

            Therefore, we cannot compute k*m + a in 64-bit integers.

            Alternative: we note that the answer might be huge, but the problem says "output the smallest x", and we are to output it as a decimal number? 

            How to handle big integers? 

            However, the constraints: the total n is 500,000, and there are at most 1000 test cases? 

            But the number of breaks in one test case? at most 500,000? 

            And we are already using 64-bit integers for the CRT? 

            But the final x0 might be huge? 

            The problem sample: 2305843009213693949 is about 2.3e18, which is within 64-bit integer? 

            Actually, 2^64 is about 1.8e19, so 2.3e18 fits.

            But what if c0=60 and m=2^61? then k = (1<<60)-1, and k*m = (2^60-1)*2^61 = 2^121 - 2^61, which is way beyond 64 bits.

            Therefore, we must avoid this.

            But note: our k is not necessarily (1<<c0)-1? 

            In the case with only S0, we have k = (1<<c0)-1.

            Then x0 = k * m + a.

            We can compute: 
                 k = (1LL<<c0) - 1;   // which is 2^c0 - 1, and c0<=60 -> so k is 2^60-1, which fits in 64 bits.

            Then m is 2^l (l<=61) -> then k * m = (2^c0-1)*2^l = 2^(c0+l) - 2^l.

            And then plus a (which is < 2^l) -> then x0 = 2^(c0+l) - 2^l + a.

            And this number might be huge? 

            How to compute without overflow? 

            We can use: 
                 x0 = ( ( (__uint128_t)1 << (c0+l) ) - ( (__uint128_t)1 << l ) + a );

            But the judge might not support __uint128_t? 

            Or we output the number in decimal as a string? 

            But the problem: the sample output is a huge number.

            Alternatively, we note that in C++ we can use unsigned long long for up to 2^64-1, and then we might need to use a big integer? 

            Given the constraints: the maximum exponent: c0+l <= 60+61 = 121, so 2^121 is about 2.6e36, which is too big for 128-bit? 128-bit is about 3.4e38, so it fits in 128-bit.

            But the problem: the total n is 500,000, and we have to do this for each test case? and t up to 1000? 

            But the total n is 500,000, so the number of test cases t is at most 1000, and the sum of n is 500,000, so t is at most 1000? -> but the worst-case t is 1000, and each n=500, but 1000 test cases would be 1000*500=500,000.

            Then we can use __uint128_t if the judge supports it? 

            Or we avoid by: 
                 if c0+l >= 128, then we output -1? -> but the sample is 2^61, which is 61.

            Or we use a method to output the number without full arithmetic? 

            But the problem sample: the third sample is 2305843009213693949, which is about 2.3e18, and we can use unsigned long long for that? 

            How about the worst-case: c0=60, l=61: then 2^(121) is about 2.6e36, which is too big for unsigned long long (which is 64 bits) and even for long long (64 bits).

            Therefore, we need to use __uint128_t in C++? 

            But the problem does not specify the compiler.

            Alternatively, we note that the smallest x0 might be astronomical, but the problem might only have test cases that fit in 64-bit? 

            The sample output: 2305843009213693949 is about 2.3e18, and the next sample is 3, then 13, then -1.

            How to handle if the number is bigger than 2^64? 

            The problem says: output the smallest x.

            But we might be in a contest that only uses 64-bit integers? 

            We must read the constraints: the a_i are between 0 and 60, and n up to 500000.

            The worst-case x0 might be huge? 

            But is there a bound? 

            We have: 
                k is at most (1<<60) (about 1e18) and then multiplied by m (which is 2^61) gives 2^121, which is 2.6e36.

            We can use a big integer library? but we are to write efficient code.

            Or we output the number in decimal? 

            How to compute (2^121) without a big integer? 

            We might use string conversion? 

            But the total number of test cases is at most 1000, and we do one big integer conversion per test case? 

            How expensive is it to convert a 128-bit integer to decimal? 121 bits -> about 38 decimal digits -> we can do by hand? 

            But we don't have a 128-bit integer? 

            Alternatively, we use a custom big integer for 128 bits? 

            Given the complexity, and the fact that the total test cases is at most 1000, we can do:

                if the exponent c0+l is > 128, then we output -1? 

            But wait, the conditions might yield a candidate that is too big? 

            Or we might try to avoid computing k*m+a if it overflows 128-bit? 

            But 128-bit is enough for 2^121.

            Therefore, we use __uint128_t if available? 

            However, the online judges: we need to be cautious.

            Let me try to use conditional compilation? 

            Alternatively, we note that the sample outputs are within 64 bits except for the third sample? 

            And the third sample is 2^61-3, which is in 64 bits? 

            Actually, 2^61 is about 2.3e18, and 2^64 is 1.8e19, so it fits.

            But wait: (1<<60)-1 is about 1.15e18, and then multiplied by 2^61 is 2.3e39, which is 128-bit.

            But the sample third: we had c0=59, so k=2^59-1, m=4, then x0 = (2^59-1)*4+1 = 2^61-4+1 = 2^61-3, and 2^61 is about 2.3e18, which fits in unsigned long long.

            Therefore, the only candidates that might overflow 64 bits are when we have both S0 and S1 and c0>= something? 

            Specifically, the candidate x0 = k * m + a, with k = ( (1<<c0)-1 ) << 1  (for the even case) or k = ( (1<< (c0-t))-1 ) << (t+1) | ((1<<t)-1) for the other case.

            And a < m, and m is 2^l.

            The even case: 
                 k = ( (1<<c0)-1 ) * 2   [which is 2^(c0+1) - 2]

                 Then x0 = (2^(c0+1) - 2) * (2^l) + a = 2^(c0+1+l) - 2^(l+1) + a.

            The other case:
                 k = ( (1<<(c0-t))-1 ) * (2^(t+1)) + (2^t - 1)

                 Then x0 = [ ( (1<<(c0-t))-1 ) * (2^(t+1)) + (2^t - 1) ] * (2^l) + a.

            This is complex.

            Given the complexity and the fact that the sample and the first two samples in the input are small, we might assume that the judge's test cases will have x0 within 64 bits? 

            But the third sample is 2^61, which is within 64 bits.

            And the worst-case might be 2^121, which is huge, and the problem sample input has a case with 60,60 -> which is 2^61, so we must output it.

            How to output very large integers in C++? 

            We can use a library, but we are not allowed.

            Alternatively, we use __uint128_t and then convert to string for output.

            We can write a function to print __uint128_t? 

            Here is a way:

                void print(__uint128_t x) {
                    if (x==0) { cout << 0; return; }
                    string s;
                    while (x) {
                        s += '0' + (x%10);
                        x /= 10;
                    }
                    reverse(s.begin(), s.end());
                    cout << s;
                }

            But we are in a contest and speed is important? 

            And the total test cases is at most 1000, and we do one 128-bit integer per test case? then 1000 conversions, and the number has at most 38 digits, so it's O(38*1000)=38,000 operations.

            We can do:

                if (x0 fits in unsigned long long) then output using cout << (unsigned long long)x0;
                else then convert to string and output.

            How to check if it fits? 

            We can do:

                if (x0 <= (__uint128_t) ULLONG_MAX) 
                    use cout << (unsigned long long) x0;
                else 
                    print as string.

            But ULLONG_MAX is the maximum unsigned long long.

            But we are in C++ and we have to use __uint128_t.

            However, the judge may not support __uint128_t.

            Alternatively, we can avoid 128-bit integers by: 
                In the even case: 
                    x0 = (2^(c0+1+l) - 2^(l+1) + a) 

                We can compute: 
                    term1 = (2^(c0+1+l)): this might be 128-bit.
                    term2 = (2^(l+1)): within 64-bit if l+1<=64, but l up to 61, so 2^(l+1) is 2^62, which is 4.6e18, which fits in unsigned long long? 
                         but 2^62 is about 4.6e18, and ULLONG_MAX is 1.8e19, so it fits.
                    a: < 2^l, which is 2^61, about 2.3e18, which also fits in unsigned long long.

                But then term1 = 2^(c0+1+l) might be very big: if c0+1+l >= 64, then we have to use something else.

            Given the time, and since the total sum of n is only 500,000, and the number of test cases is not too many, we decide to use __uint128_t if the compiler allows, or we hope that the judge supports it.

            We'll use:

                #ifdef __SIZEOF_INT128__
                    // use __uint128_t
                #else
                    // use a custom big integer for up to 128 bits? 
                #endif

            But we don't want to implement big integer.

            Or we might use boost::multiprecision? but not available.

            Given the sample, we know that the worst-case in the sample is 2^61, so we can try to compute in 64-bit if the exponent is not too big.

            Specifically, if c0+1+l > 128, then we output -1? 

            But the problem: it might be a valid solution.

            Given the complexity and the constraints on a_i (<=60) and the breaks (t_i<=60), the maximum exponent l in the combined modulus is 61.

            Then c0 is at most 60, so c0+1+l <= 60+1+61 = 122, so we are within 128 bits.

            Therefore, we can use __uint128_t.

            Steps for code:

                We will use unsigned long long for a and m and the lower part, and for k? 
                But then x0 = k (which is a 64-bit number) * m (64-bit) + a (64-bit) might overflow.

                So we do:

                    __uint128_t x0 = (__uint128_t)k * m + a;

                Then we need to output x0.

            How to output __uint128_t? 

                Write a function to print it in decimal.

            We'll assume that the total test cases is not huge (1000) and we can convert to string.

            Let's code accordingly.

            Summary of the entire algorithm for one test case:

              Step 0: Read n and the array a of size n.

              Step 1: 
                  if n==0: output 0? 
                  Check for i in [1, n-1]: if a[i] (which is a_i for the i-th number, note: the array a[0..n-1]) 
                  Condition A: for i from 1 to n-1: if a[i] == 0, then invalid? 
                      -> but Condition A: for i>=1, a[i]>=1? -> so if a[i]==0 for i>=1, then output -1.
                  Condition B: for i from 0 to n-2:
                         if a[i+1] < 1 || a[i+1] > a[i]+1) {
                             output -1 and break;
                         }
                  Condition C: for i from 0 to n-3:
                         if a[i+1] != a[i]+1) {
                             if a[i+2] != a[i+1]+1) {
                                 output -1 and break;
                             }
                         }

              Step 2: 
                  Let breaks = vector<int> for the indices i (0-indexed) in [0, n-2] such that a[i+1] != a[i]+1.
                  For each such i, compute:
                         t_i = a[i] - a[i+1] + 1;   [we know it is in [1, a[i]] by condition B]

                  Solve the congruence system:

                         a_sol = 0, m_exp = 0 -> then m = 1 (which is 2^0)

                         for each i in breaks (in increasing order of i? we do in the order of breaks? but the order might not matter, but for determinism we do increasing i):

                             l = t_i+1;
                             M = (1ULL << l);   // modulus 2^l
                             A = ( (1ULL << t_i) - 1 - i ) % M;
                             if (A < 0) A += M;   // but since i and the others are nonnegative, we can do:
                                 // Actually, (1<<t_i)-1 might be < i? then we do:

                             We do: 
                                 A = ( (1ULL << t_i) - 1 ) % M;
                                 A = (A - i) % M;
                                 if (A < 0) A += M;

                             Now, let current_mod_exp = m_exp, so current modulus = 2^{m_exp} = m_val (we don't store m_val, we only store the exponent? because we work with powers of 2)

                             Actually, we store a_sol (a solution modulo the current modulus) and m_val = 1ULL<<m_exp.

                             But we will update the exponent.

                             Alternatively, we store the exponent and the solution.

                             Let g = min(m_exp, l);
                             mask = (1ULL << g) - 1;
                             if ( (a_sol & mask) != (A & mask) ) {
                                 return -1 for the test case;
                             }

                             if (m_exp <= l) {
                                 // update a_sol: 
                                 // We have: x0 = a_sol (mod 2^{m_exp})
                                 // and we want: x0 = A (mod 2^l)

                                 // Then: x0 = a_sol + k * (1<<m_exp) for some integer k.
                                 // Then: a_sol + k * (1<<m_exp) â‰¡ A (mod 1<<l)
                                 // => k * (1<<m_exp) = (A - a_sol) mod (1<<l)
                                 // Since (1<<m_exp) divides (1<<l) in the ring? 
                                 // Let d = (A - a_sol) and we know d is divisible by (1<<g) [because they are congruent modulo 2^g] and g = m_exp? (because m_exp<=l -> g=m_exp)

                                 // Actually, we know d is divisible by 2^{m_exp}? 
                                 // Then we can write: k0 = d >> m_exp;
                                 // Then k = k0 mod (2^(l - m_exp))

                                 // Then the solution modulo 2^l is: 
                                 //    a_sol + k0 * (1<<m_exp)  (and then mod 2^l)

                                 // But note: k0 is in the range [0, 2^l - 1) ? 
                                 // Actually, we take k0 = d >> m_exp, and then the solution is a_sol + k0 * (1<<m_exp) 

                                 a_sol = a_sol + ( ( (A - a_sol) >> m_exp ) << m_exp );
                                 // But (A - a_sol) is divisible by 1<<m_exp, so (A - a_sol) >> m_exp is an integer.

                                 // Then set m_exp = l;
                             }
                             else {
                                 // m_exp > l: then we don't update a_sol or m_exp? 
                                 // because the current solution a_sol is already modulo 2^{m_exp}, which is divisible by 2^l, so a_sol mod 2^l = A must hold? 
                                 // We checked the mask, so it holds.
                                 // do nothing.
                             }

                  After processing all breaks, we have a_sol and m_exp, and the modulus m_val = 1ULL<<m_exp.

              Step 3: 
                  // Check the entire sequence with candidate a_sol and then the higher part k to be determined.

                  // Determine the sets S0 and S1:

                  //   S0: indices j in [0, n-1] such that (a_sol + j) < m_val.
                  //   S1: the rest.

                  // For j in S0: 
                  //    p_low = __builtin_popcountll(a_sol + j);
                  //    c0 = a[j] - p_low   [should be independent of j]
                  // For j in S1:
                  //    p_low = __builtin_popcountll(a_sol + j - m_val);
                  //    c1 = a[j] - p_low   [should be independent of j]

                  // Check the consistency of c0 and c1 in their sets.

                  // Also, c0 and c1 must be nonnegative.

                  // Then determine k (the quotient) as described.

              Step 4: 
                  Compute the candidate k_value (as an integer) for the higher part.

                  Then x0 = (__uint128_t) k_value * (1ULL<<m_exp) + a_sol;

                  Then verify the entire sequence by iterating j from 0 to n-1:

                         __uint128_t xj = x0 + j;
                         // But we don't want to use 128-bit popcount? 

                         // Instead, split: 
                         //    low_part = (a_sol + j) % m_val;
                         //    high_part = k_value + (a_sol + j) / m_val;

                         // But note: 
                         //    If (a_sol + j) < m_val: 
                         //        then (a_sol+j) / m_val = 0, so high_part = k_value, low_part = a_sol+j.
                         //    Else:
                         //        then (a_sol+j) / m_val = 1, so high_part = k_value+1, low_part = a_sol+j - m_val.

                         // Then popcount = __builtin_popcountll(low_part) + __builtin_popcountll(high_part);

                         // However, high_part might be a 128-bit integer? 

                         // But note: k_value is at most (1<<60) (a 64-bit integer), and k_value+1 is also 64-bit.

                         // And low_part is less than m_val=2^{m_exp} which is 2^61, so it is 64-bit.

                         // So we can use:

                         unsigned long long high, low;
                         if (a_sol + j < m_val) {
                             high = k_value;
                             low = a_sol + j;
                         } else {
                             high = k_value + 1;
                             low = a_sol + j - m_val;
                         }
                         int total = __builtin_popcountll(low) + __builtin_popcountll(high);
                         if (total != a[j]) {
                             break; // or mark as invalid
                         }

                  If it passes for all j, then output x0 (converted to string if necessary).

                  If not, then we try the next candidate for k_value? 

                  But we don't generate next candidates, so then output -1.

            However, note: we have only one candidate for k_value (the smallest one), and if it fails, we return -1.

            But it should not fail? 

            Given the potential complexity, we hope it works.

            Let's hope.

            Let's test with the sample: 
                "5
                 3 3 4 1 2"

            We'll not do by hand.

            We'll rely on the sample output 13.

            Given the complexity, we output the code.

            Note: The sample "2
                    60 60" should output 2305843009213693949.

            We'll try to run locally.

            Important: for the sample "60,60", we have:

                n=2, a = [60,60]

                Condition B: a1=60 is in [1, 60+1] -> valid.
                Condition C: none (n-2=0) -> skip.

                Then breaks: 
                    i=0: a1 = 60, which is not a0+1=61, so break.
                    t0 = 60 - 60 + 1 = 1.
