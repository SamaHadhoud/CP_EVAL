To solve this problem, we need to find a pair of students (a, b) such that they have at least k common questions answered with the same character. The solution involves efficiently checking all possible pairs of students while leveraging early termination to optimize the process.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires checking each pair of students (a, b) where a < b to determine if they share at least k common questions answered identically. Given the constraints (n ≤ 5000, m ≤ 3000, k ≤ 5), a brute-force approach would be infeasible. Thus, we need an optimized solution.
2. **Key Insight**: For each student, precompute the positions of non-dot answers. This allows us to focus only on relevant positions during pair checks.
3. **Early Termination**: When checking a pair (a, b), iterate over the shorter list of non-dot positions. For each position, if both students have the same non-dot character, increment a match count. If the count reaches k, immediately validate the pair. Additionally, if the remaining positions (plus current matches) cannot reach k, break early to save computation.
4. **Search Order**: To meet the output requirements (smallest b, then largest a), iterate b from 2 to n (1-indexed), and for each b, check a from b-1 down to 1. The first valid pair found for any b (starting from the smallest b) will be the answer due to the search order.
5. **Validation**: Skip pairs where either student has fewer than k non-dot answers, as they cannot meet the similarity condition.

        non_dot_positions.append(positions)
        valid.append(len(positions) >= k_val)

            da = len(list_a)
            db = len(list_b)
            count = 0
            if da <= db:
                L = da
                for idx, j in enumerate(list_a):
                    if grid[b][j] != '.' and grid[a][j] == grid[b][j]:
                        count += 1
                        if count >= k_val:
                            break
                    remaining = L - idx - 1
                    if count + remaining < k_val:
                        break
            else:
                L = db
                for idx, j in enumerate(list_b):
                    if grid[a][j] != '.' and grid[a][j] == grid[b][j]:
                        count += 1
                        if count >= k_val:
                            break
                    remaining = L - idx - 1
                    if count + remaining < k_val:

            if count >= k_val:
                print(f"{a + 1} {b + 1}")
                return

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.
2. **Preprocessing**: For each student, we store the indices of non-dot answers and determine if they have at least k non-dot answers (`valid` list).
3. **Special Case Handling**: If `k_val` is 0, every pair is valid, so we immediately return the first and last student (though the problem states k ≥ 1, this is a safeguard).
4. **Pair Validation**: For each student `b` (from 1 to n-1, 0-indexed), we check all previous students `a` (from b-1 down to 0). If both students are `valid`, we proceed to count matching answers:
   - **Shorter List Iteration**: To minimize checks, we iterate over the shorter list of non-dot positions between the two students.
   - **Early Termination**: If during iteration the count of matches reaches `k_val`, we print the pair and exit. If the remaining positions plus current matches cannot reach `k_val`, we break early.
5. **Output**: If no valid pair is found after all checks, we print `-1`.

This approach efficiently checks pairs by leveraging preprocessing and early termination, ensuring optimal performance for the given constraints.
