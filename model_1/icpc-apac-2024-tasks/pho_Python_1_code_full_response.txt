To solve this problem, we need to minimize the number of contestants moved between tables such that each table ends up either empty or with all contestants ordering the same dish (either *phở tái* (0) or *phở chín* (1)). The key insight is that for each table, the minimal number of contestants to move is the smaller of the counts of 0s or 1s at that table. However, we must ensure that there is at least one table set to dish 0 if there are any contestants wanting dish 0, and similarly for dish 1. If not, we must adjust by converting a table to the missing dish, incurring an additional cost which is minimized by choosing the table with the smallest possible loss.

### Approach
1. **Initial Setup**: Read the number of tables, \( n \), and the binary strings representing each table's initial state.
2. **Process Each Table**: For each table, count the number of 0s (`count0`) and 1s (`count1`). The minimal contestants to move from this table is `min(count0, count1)`, so the saved contestants (those not moved) is `max(count0, count1)`. Update flags `has0` and `has1` if the table can be naturally set to dish 0 or 1 (i.e., `count0 >= count1` or `count1 >= count0`). For tables that cannot be naturally set to a dish, record the cost (loss) if forced to set to the minority dish.
3. **Global Adjustment**: If there are contestants wanting dish 0 but no table is naturally set to it, find the minimal loss from forcing a table to dish 0. Similarly, if there are contestants wanting dish 1 but no table is naturally set to it, find the minimal loss from forcing a table to dish 1. Adjust the total saved contestants by subtracting these losses.
4. **Compute Result**: The minimal moves required is the total contestants minus the adjusted saved contestants.

### Solution Code
```python
import sys

def main():
    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()
    n = int(data[0])
    total_contestants = 0
    total_zeros = 0
    total_ones = 0
    saving0 = 0
    has0 = False
    has1 = False
    list_force0 = []
    list_force1 = []
    
    index = 1
    for i in range(n):
        s = data[index].strip()
        index += 1
        L = len(s)
        total_contestants += L
        count0 = s.count('0')
        count1 = L - count0
        total_zeros += count0
        total_ones += count1
        saving0 += max(count0, count1)
        
        if count0 >= count1:
            has0 = True
        if count1 >= count0:
            has1 = True
            
        if count0 < count1:
            loss0 = count1 - count0
            list_force0.append(loss0)
        if count1 < count0:
            loss1 = count0 - count1
            list_force1.append(loss1)
            
    if total_zeros > 0 and not has0:
        if list_force0:
            min_loss0 = min(list_force0)
            saving0 -= min_loss0
    if total_ones > 0 and not has1:
        if list_force1:
            min_loss1 = min(list_force1)
            saving0 -= min_loss1
            
    moves = total_contestants - saving0
    print(moves)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.
2. **Processing Each Table**: For each table, the number of contestants wanting dish 0 (`count0`) and dish 1 (`count1`) is counted. The total saved contestants (`saving0`) is the sum of the maximum of `count0` and `count1` across all tables, representing contestants not moved. Flags `has0` and `has1` are set if a table can be naturally set to dish 0 or 1.
3. **Global Adjustment**: If there are contestants wanting dish 0 but no table is naturally set to it, the minimal additional cost (loss) to convert a table to dish 0 is subtracted from `saving0`. Similarly for dish 1, ensuring the solution meets the global requirement of having at least one table for each dish present.
4. **Result Calculation**: The minimal moves required is the difference between the total contestants and the adjusted saved contestants (`saving0`).

This approach efficiently minimizes the moves by leveraging per-table optimization and adjusting for global constraints with minimal additional cost. The complexity is linear with respect to the total number of contestants, making it suitable for large inputs.
