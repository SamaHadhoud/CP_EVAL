To solve this problem, we need to find a pair of students (a, b) such that they have at least `k` common questions answered with the same character. The solution should prioritize pairs with the smallest `b` and, in case of ties, the largest `a`. If no such pair exists, we return -1.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires checking all possible pairs of students to determine if they share at least `k` common questions where both answered identically. Given the constraints (n ≤ 5000, m ≤ 3000, k ≤ 5), a brute-force approach would be too slow. Thus, we need an optimized solution.

2. **Key Insights**:
   - **Preprocessing**: For each student, precompute the positions of non-dot answers (i.e., questions they answered) and store these positions in a list. This helps in efficiently accessing relevant positions during pair checks.
   - **Bitset for Common Positions**: For each student, use a bitset to mark positions where they answered (non-dot). This allows quick computation of common positions between any two students using bitwise AND operations.
   - **Early Termination**: For each candidate pair (a, b), if the number of common positions (where both answered) is less than `k`, skip further checks. Otherwise, iterate through the shorter list of non-dot positions to count matching answers, breaking early if `k` matches are found.

3. **Algorithm Selection**:
   - **Preprocessing**: For each student, store non-dot positions and a bitset indicating these positions.
   - **Pair Validation**: For each pair (a, b) where a < b:
     - Skip if either student has fewer than `k` non-dot answers.
     - Compute common positions using bitset AND. If the count of common positions is less than `k`, skip.
     - Iterate the shorter list of non-dot positions. For each position, if both students have the same answer, increment the match count. If the count reaches `k`, return the pair immediately.
   - **Output Handling**: The first valid pair encountered (smallest `b`, largest `a` for that `b`) is the solution. If no pair is found, return -1.

4. **Complexity Analysis**:
   - **Preprocessing**: O(n*m) to scan each student's answers and record non-dot positions.
   - **Pair Checking**: For each valid pair (min(da, db) ≥ k), checking common positions is O(m/64) with bitset operations. Counting matches is O(min(da, db)) but typically O(k) due to early termination. With n=5000, the number of valid pairs is O(n²) in the worst case, but the operations per pair are efficient (O(47) for bitset and O(k) for matching, making the total feasible within time constraints.

                student_bits[i].set(j);
            }
        }
    }

    for (int b = 1; b < n; b++) {
        for (int a = b - 1; a >= 0; a--) {
            int da = non_dot_positions[a].size();
            int db = non_dot_positions[b].size();
            if (min(da, db) < k) {
                continue;
            }

            bitset<MAXM> common = student_bits[a] & student_bits[b];
            if (common.count() < static_cast<size_t>(k)) {
                continue;
            }

            int count = 0;
            if (da <= db) {
                for (int idx = 0; idx < da; idx++) {
                    int j = non_dot_positions[a][idx];
                    if (common[j] && grid[a][j] == grid[b][j]) {
                        count++;
                        if (count >= k) {
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                }
            } else {
                for (int idx = 0; idx < db; idx++) {
                    int j = non_dot_positions[b][idx];
                    if (common[j] && grid[a][j] == grid[b][j]) {
                        count++;
                        if (count >= k) {
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }

            if (count >= k) {
                cout << a + 1 << " " << b + 1 << endl;
                return 0;
            }
        }
    }

    cout << -1 << endl;
    return 0;
}

### Explanation
1. **Preprocessing**: For each student, we store the positions of their non-dot answers in a list (`non_dot_positions`) and a bitset (`student_bits`) where each bit represents whether the student answered that question.
2. **Pair Validation**: For each student `b` (from the second to the last), we check all previous students `a` (from `b-1` down to the first). For each pair:
   - If either student has fewer than `k` non-dot answers, skip the pair.
   - Compute common positions using bitset AND. If the count of common positions is less than `k`, skip further checks.
   - Iterate the shorter list of non-dot positions. For each position, if both students have the same answer, increment the match count. If the count reaches `k`, immediately return the pair (a+1, b+1) due to the search order (smallest `b`, largest `a`).
3. **Output**: If no valid pair is found after all checks, output -1.

This approach efficiently narrows down potential pairs using preprocessing and early termination, leveraging bitset operations for quick common position checks and character comparisons for validation, ensuring optimal performance within constraints.
