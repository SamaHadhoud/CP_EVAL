We are given n tables, each with a binary string S_i. The goal is to have each table either empty or having all contestants ordering the same dish (all 0s for pho tai or all 1s for pho chin). We can move contestants from one table to another (any table, and tables can be left empty). We want the minimum number of moves.

Note: Moving a contestant counts as one move, regardless of the source and destination.

Observations:
1. After moving, each table must be monochromatic (all 0s or all 1s) or empty.
2. We can leave a table empty? But note: initially, every table has at least one contestant. However, after moving, a table might become empty. But we cannot remove contestants, only move them. Also, we cannot add new tables. So we have exactly n tables, but some might be empty at the end.

However, note: we are allowed to move contestants arbitrarily. We can also leave contestants at their original table.

Important: The problem does not require that we have at least one contestant at each table. Some tables may become empty.

But note: The entire set of contestants must be seated at the n tables. We are not removing any contestant.

We can think of the entire set of contestants: we have a multiset of 0s and 1s. We want to assign each contestant to one of the n tables such that at each table, the assigned contestants are all 0s or all 1s. And we want to minimize the number of moves? Actually, moving a contestant from their original table to another table counts as one move. So if a contestant is moved, that is one move.

Alternatively, we can consider that each contestant has an initial table. In the final arrangement, if a contestant is at a different table than their initial, that counts as a move.

Therefore, we are to assign each contestant to one of the n tables (possibly different from their initial) such that:
- For each table, the contestants assigned to it are all 0 or all 1.

We wish to minimize the total number of moves (i.e., the number of contestants that are not at their initial table).

But note: we are allowed to leave a contestant at their initial table, and that counts as 0 moves.

How to approach?

We have two types of tables in the final arrangement: tables that are all 0 and tables that are all 1. We can also have empty tables. Since we have n tables, we can partition the tables into two groups: some for 0 and some for 1. But note: we are not forced to use all tables? Actually, we can leave a table empty. However, if a table is empty, then it has no dish? That is acceptable.

But note: we cannot remove a table. We have n tables. So each table must be assigned a color (0, 1, or none). However, the problem says: "after moving the contestants, the following condition should be satisfied by each table: either there is no contestant seated at that table or all contestants seated at that table would like to order the same dish."

So we have two types of non-empty tables: 0-tables and 1-tables.

Let:
  total0 = total number of contestants that prefer 0 (pho tai)
  total1 = total number of contestants that prefer 1 (pho chin)

In the final assignment, we will assign:
  - Some contestants to 0-tables: all must be 0s.
  - Some contestants to 1-tables: all must be 1s.

The key is: we are free to choose which tables become 0-tables, which become 1-tables, and which become empty. However, we have to account for the moves.

But note: each contestant has an initial table. If we move a contestant, we break the link with the initial table. However, the problem does not say that we can split the initial table's contestants arbitrarily? Actually, we can move any contestant to any table.

But here is a twist: the initial table of a contestant is fixed. So if we leave a contestant at their initial table, then that table must be assigned a color that matches the contestant's dish? Not exactly: because the table might have multiple contestants. However, we are allowed to move contestants arbitrarily. So the entire initial table can be broken apart: we can move some contestants away and leave others.

But note: if we leave two contestants at the same initial table, then they must both have the same dish? Actually, no: because we might have moved away some contestants and then the ones that are left at the table must be of the same dish. However, we might also leave a contestant at the table and move the others away. Then the one left must be either 0 or 1? But the table must be monochromatic. So if we leave one contestant, then the table becomes that dish.

Alternatively, we can move everyone away from the table, then the table is empty.

So the problem becomes: we have to assign each contestant to a table (from the n available) such that the table they end up at is assigned a color that matches their dish. And we want to minimize the number of contestants that are not at their initial table.

We can rephrase: minimize the total moves = sum_{each contestant} I[they are not at initial table].

But note: we are free to choose the table for each contestant and the color for each table (with the constraint that a table can have at most one color, and if non-empty, then the color must be 0 or 1).

How to model?

We have n tables. We can assign to each table a color: 0, 1, or none (empty). However, the assignment of contestants must be consistent: a contestant with dish 0 must be assigned to a table that is either empty (and then we set the table to 0) or already set to 0. Similarly for dish 1.

But note: we can assign multiple contestants to the same table. The only constraint is that at a table, if there are contestants, they must all have the same dish.

We wish to minimize the moves. The moves are counted per contestant: if a contestant is not assigned to their initial table, then it's a move.

Therefore, we can think of:

  For each contestant, we have two choices for their dish: they are fixed (they are either 0 or 1). But we have to assign them to a table. The dish they have must match the table's color. The table they are initially at is known.

However, we are free to change the table they are at. The catch: if we assign a contestant to a table that is not their initial table, that counts as a move.

We are also free to choose the color for each table? Actually, the color of a table is determined by the dish of the contestants we assign to it. But if we assign a contestant to a table, then we set the color of that table to the dish of that contestant. Then any subsequent contestant assigned to that table must have the same dish.

But note: we can assign multiple contestants to the same table. And we can assign contestants arbitrarily to any table.

Therefore, the problem is equivalent to:

  We have n tables. We are going to assign each contestant to one of the n tables. The table must then be colored by the dish of the contestants assigned to it (and if multiple, then they must be the same). We are free to choose the assignment.

  We wish to minimize the total moves = number of contestants that are assigned to a table that is not their initial table.

But note: the initial table of a contestant is fixed. So for a contestant, if we assign them to their initial table, that's 0 move; if we assign to a different table, that's 1 move.

How to solve? It seems complex because we have up to 100,000 tables and total 500,000 contestants.

Alternative Insight:

Consider the entire multiset of contestants: we have total0 zeros and total1 ones.

In the final assignment, we will assign each contestant to a table. The assignment must satisfy that at each table, the contestants are all 0 or all 1.

But note: we are allowed to leave tables empty. So we can use as many tables as we want for zeros and ones. However, we are constrained by the fact that we have only n tables.

But we can use at most n tables: we can use some for zeros, some for ones, and the rest empty.

However, the moves are independent of the assignment to which table? Actually, no: the move of a contestant depends on whether we assign them to their initial table or not.

We can think of each table independently? But the assignments of contestants to tables are interdependent: we can put contestants from different initial tables together.

But note: the moves are additive: each contestant moved counts one.

We can try to decide for each table whether it becomes a 0-table, a 1-table, or empty. However, we must account for:

  - The cost of leaving a contestant at their initial table: if we leave a contestant at the initial table, then the table must be assigned the color of that contestant? But wait: we can have multiple contestants at the same table. So we can leave several contestants at their initial table only if they are all of the same dish? Otherwise, we must move some.

So for a given table i, we have a string S_i. We can choose to:

  Option 1: Make the table a 0-table. Then we must move all the 1s in S_i to some other table (and we can leave the 0s at table i? but note: if we leave a 0 at table i, that is 0 moves. However, we might also choose to move some 0s? Why would we? Because we might free up the table to become a 1-table? But we are making it a 0-table. So we must move the 1s, and we can leave the 0s. The cost for table i if we make it 0: cost_i(0) = number of '1's in S_i.

  Option 2: Make the table a 1-table. Then cost_i(1) = number of '0's in S_i.

  Option 3: Make the table empty. Then we must move all contestants from table i to other tables. So cost_i(empty) = |S_i|.

But wait: if we make a table empty, we move everyone. But we can also consider that we are going to use other tables to hold the zeros and ones. However, note: if we move a contestant, we have to assign them to some table. And that table must be set to the dish of that contestant. So if we move a contestant from table i to table j, then table j must be set to the dish of that contestant. And we are free to set table j to that dish? But we have to choose the color for table j.

However, the entire assignment is global. The above per-table costs are not independent because:

  - We are free to assign contestants to any table. But if we leave a contestant at their initial table, we avoid a move. But if we move a contestant, we can assign them to any table that is set to their dish. And that table might be set to their dish by other contestants (from the same initial table or different) that we assign there.

But note: we can also move contestants to tables that we decide to set to their dish. The key is: we are going to set each table to either 0, 1, or empty. And we can assign any contestant to any table as long as the dish matches.

Therefore, the entire cost is the sum over all contestants: 1 if they are moved, 0 if they are not.

But for a contestant that is left at their initial table, we require that the initial table is set to their dish. If we set the initial table to the opposite dish, then we cannot leave them there. And if we set the table to empty, then we must move them.

So for a contestant at initial table i with dish d, they can be left at table i only if we set table i to d. Otherwise, they must be moved.

Therefore, if we decide the color for every table, then the cost for contestant at table i with dish d is:

  0 if table i is set to d.
  1 if table i is set to the opposite dish or to empty? Actually, if we set the table to the opposite dish, then we cannot leave any contestant of dish d? Actually, we cannot leave that contestant at table i because then the dish would be the opposite? So we must move that contestant. Similarly, if we set the table to empty, then we must move the contestant.

But note: if we set a table to a color, we can leave only contestants of that color at that table. So if we set table i to d, then we can leave the contestants at table i that are of dish d, but we must move the ones that are not. However, if we set table i to the opposite dish, then we cannot leave any contestant at table i (because the dish of the contestant is d, but the table is set to the opposite) so we must move all.

Therefore, the cost for table i if we set it to color c is:

  If c = 0: then we must move all the 1s at table i -> cost = count1_i.
  If c = 1: then we must move all the 0s at table i -> cost = count0_i.
  If c = empty: then we must move everyone -> cost = |S_i|.

But note: if we set a table to a color, we can also choose to move some of the contestants that are of that color? Why would we? Because we might free up the table to be used for a different purpose? Actually, we can leave the ones that are of the color we set, and we must move the others. There's no benefit to moving a contestant that could have stayed.

Therefore, the minimal cost for table i is:

  min( count0_i, count1_i, |S_i| )   ??? 

But wait: if we set the table to 0, we only move the 1s -> count1_i.
If we set to 1, we move the 0s -> count0_i.
If we set to empty, we move everyone -> |S_i|.

But note: |S_i| = count0_i + count1_i.

And min(count0_i, count1_i) <= |S_i|, so the minimal per table would be min(count0_i, count1_i). So why consider empty? Actually, min(count0_i, count1_i) is always <= |S_i|, so we would never choose to set a table to empty? 

But wait: what if we set a table to empty, then we free up that table to be used for other contestants? However, we have n tables. We can set the table to a color and still use it for other contestants. In fact, we are allowed to assign contestants from multiple initial tables to the same table. So if we set a table to a color, we can use it for multiple initial tables.

Therefore, the decision to set a table to empty is not beneficial in terms of the per-table cost? Because min(count0_i, count1_i) is always <= |S_i|. So we can always set a table to the majority color and leave the majority and move the minority. That is cheaper than moving everyone.

But consider: if we set the table to empty, we move everyone. Then we have an extra table that we can use arbitrarily? How does that help?

Example: 
  Suppose we have two tables: 
      Table 1: "01" -> cost0 = 1 (if set to 0: move the 1), cost1 = 1 (if set to 1: move the 0). 
      Table 2: "01" -> same.

  If we set each table to a color, we would move 1 from table1 and 1 from table2 -> total moves = 2.

  Alternatively, we could set table1 to empty (cost=2) and set table2 to 0 (cost=1) and then assign the two 0s to table2 and the two 1s to table2? But wait: table2 can only be set to one color. We cannot set it to both 0 and 1. So we have to use at least two tables for the two colors? Actually, we have two tables. We can set table1 to 0 and table2 to 1? Then we move the 1 from table1 to table2 and the 0 from table2 to table1? That is 2 moves.

  But what if we set table1 to empty (so we move both contestants) and then set table1 to 0 and table2 to 1? Then we assign the 0 from table1 to table1? But we set table1 to empty? Then we moved the 0 from table1? Actually, we can reassign the 0 from table1 to table1? But if we set table1 to 0, then we can leave the 0 at table1. But if we set the table to empty, we moved everyone. Then we can later reassign the table to 0 and assign the 0 back? But that would be a move: because the contestant was initially at table1 and we moved them away? Actually, we cannot leave the contestant at table1 if we set the table to empty: we have to move them. Then if we assign them back to table1, that counts as moving them away and then back? So that would be two moves? Actually, no: we moved them to some table? Then we assign them back? But the move is counted as soon as they are not at the initial table. So if we move them to table2 and then back to table1, that would be two moves? Actually, the problem does not specify that we can reassign arbitrarily. The move is defined as moving a contestant to a different table. So if we move a contestant from table1 to table2 and then to table1 again, that would be two moves? But the problem says "move zero or more contestants to a different table". So we are allowed to move a contestant only once: we assign them to a final table. Therefore, the move is the assignment to a table that is not the initial one. So if we assign a contestant to table1 (their initial table) then no move. If we assign them to table2, then one move.

Therefore, in the above example, setting table1 to empty (cost=2) and then setting table1 to 0 and table2 to 1, and then assigning the 0 that was initially at table1 to table1 (but we had to move them away? Then we assign them back? Actually, we never moved them: we are allowed to assign them to table1? But we set table1 to empty? Then we must have moved them. Then we cannot assign them to table1? We set table1 to empty, meaning we moved everyone. Then we can set table1 to 0 and then assign the 0 to table1? But that contestant was moved: because they were initially at table1 and we moved them to somewhere else? Then we assign them to table1? That is allowed? But that counts as two moves: one for moving away and one for moving back? Actually, the problem does not specify multiple moves. We are only allowed to move a contestant once to a different table. Then we leave them there. So we assign each contestant exactly once to a table.

Therefore, we have to assign each contestant to one table. The move is defined as: if the assigned table is not the initial table, then that contestant is moved (counted once).

So in the above scenario, if we set table1 to empty, then we move both contestants from table1 to, say, table2? Then we set table2 to 0? Then the 0 from table1 is at table2 (so that's a move) and the 1 from table1 is at table2? But then we have both 0 and 1 at table2? That is not allowed. Alternatively, we set table2 to 0? Then we must move the 1 from table1 to table1? But we set table1 to empty? Then we cannot use table1? So we cannot assign the 1 from table1 to table1? Then we have to assign it to table2? But then table2 has both 0 and 1? Not allowed. So we have to set table1 to 0 and table2 to 1? Then we move the 1 from table1 to table2 and the 0 from table2 to table1? That is 2 moves.

Alternatively, we can set table1 to 0 and table2 to 1: then we move the 1 from table1 to table2 and the 0 from table2 to table1 -> 2 moves.

But note: if we set table1 to empty, we have moved both. Then we can set table1 to 1 and table2 to 0? Then we assign the 0 from table1 to table2? and the 1 from table1 to table1? But that is still 2 moves: the 0 from table1 is moved to table2, the 1 from table1 is moved to table1? But wait: we set table1 to empty? Then we moved the 1 from table1? Then we assign it to table1? That is a move? Actually, we moved it to some temporary location? Then we assign it back? The problem does not specify that we can store them temporarily. We assign each contestant to one table. So we cannot assign the 1 from table1 to table1 if we set table1 to empty? Because we set table1 to empty: meaning we have no contestant at table1? Then we cannot assign the 1 to table1 until we set table1 to 1? But we can set the table to 1 and then assign the 1 to it. However, the assignment is the final assignment. So we can set table1 to 1 and then assign the 1 (that was initially at table1) to table1. But that contestant was initially at table1 and we are assigning them to table1? That is not a move. But we set the table to empty? Then we had to move them? Actually, the decision to set a table to empty forces us to move every contestant initially at that table. Then we can reassign some of them back to that table? But that would be allowed? Then the cost for that contestant is: we moved them? Actually, the problem says: moving a contestant to a different table. If we assign a contestant to their initial table, that is 0 moves. But if we set the table to empty, we must move them? Then we assign them to the same table? That is not moving them? 

This is confusing.

Let me clarify: 
  - The move is defined as: a contestant is moved if they are seated at a different table from their initial table.

Therefore, if we assign a contestant to their initial table, that is 0 moves. If we assign them to a different table, that is 1 move.

So if we set table1 to empty, we are forced to move every contestant from table1. Then we can assign them to any table, including table1? But if we assign them to table1, then they are seated at their initial table? Then that is 0 moves? But we set the table to empty? Then we cannot have any contestant at table1? 

The problem states: "after moving the contestants" the condition holds. So the assignment must be such that at each table, the condition holds.

Therefore, if we set table1 to empty, then at the end there should be no contestant at table1. So we cannot assign any contestant to table1. Therefore, we must assign every contestant initially at table1 to a table that is not table1. That counts as one move per contestant.

So if we set a table to empty, we must assign every contestant initially at that table to a different table. That costs |S_i|.

But if we set a table to a color, we can leave the contestants of that color at that table (so no move for them) and we must move the others to some other table (that we set to the opposite color? and we can use that table for multiple initial tables).

Therefore, the minimal cost for table i is min( count0_i, count1_i ) because we can set the table to the majority and move the minority. And we do not need to consider setting to empty because it is always at least as expensive as min(count0_i, count1_i). Therefore, we can assume that we never set a table to empty? But wait: what if we set a table to empty, then we free up that table to be used for contestants from other tables? How does that help?

Consider: if we set a table to empty, we free up a table. Then we can use that table for a new color? But we only have two colors. So we can only set the table to 0 or 1. So having an extra table available doesn't help? Because we can assign multiple initial tables to the same table. There is no constraint on the number of contestants per table.

Therefore, the only reason to set a table to empty is if we cannot use it to hold any dish? But we can always set it to 0 or 1. Therefore, setting a table to empty is never beneficial? 

So we can ignore the option of setting a table to empty? Then the minimal cost for table i is min(count0_i, count1_i). Then the total minimal cost would be the sum over i of min(count0_i, count1_i). 

But wait: what about the global constraints? We have to assign all contestants to some table. But we are moving contestants to other tables. However, when we move a contestant, we are assigning them to a table that is set to their dish. But that table might be set to their dish by other contestants that are left at that table. And we are already accounting for the cost at each table: the min(count0_i, count1_i) at table i is the cost for moving the minority dish away? But actually, we are moving the minority dish to another table. Then at that other table, we have to account for them? 

But note: when we move a contestant of dish d from table i to table j, then table j must be set to d. Then if table j is set to d, we can leave the contestants that are already at table j of dish d? And we must move the contestants at table j that are not dish d? 

However, we are already accounting for the cost at table j: the min(count0_j, count1_j) for table j. But if we move additional contestants to table j, then the counts at table j change? 

This is the catch: our per-table cost min(count0_i, count1_i) is only for the contestants initially at table i. But we might move contestants from other tables to table i? And we might move contestants from table i to other tables? 

Therefore, we cannot compute the cost independently per table.

We have to account for the entire assignment. 

Alternative Insight:

The entire assignment must satisfy:

  - Each contestant is assigned to exactly one table.
  - Each table is either empty, all 0, or all 1.

The cost is the number of contestants that are not assigned to their initial table.

We can express the cost as:

  total_moves = (total number of contestants) - (number of contestants that are assigned to their initial table).

Therefore, to minimize moves, we want to maximize the number of contestants that are assigned to their initial table.

But note: we can only assign a contestant to their initial table if the table is set to their dish. And we can set the table to their dish only if we do not have any contestant of the opposite dish left at that table? Actually, we can set the table to their dish and then leave them, but we must move the contestants of the opposite dish.

Therefore, for a table i, if we set it to d, then we can leave all the contestants at table i that are d. The cost saved is the number of d in table i? And we cannot leave the contestants of the opposite dish.

So the saving at table i if we set it to d is count_d,i. Then the total saving is the sum over tables of the saving we get from the table's color choice.

But note: we cannot set a table to two colors. And we are free to choose the color per table.

Moreover, we can also move contestants from their initial table to another table and then leave them at that other table? But then they are not at their initial table, so we don't save a move.

Therefore, the problem reduces to:

  We wish to assign to each table i a color c_i in {0,1} (we ignore empty since it is dominated) so as to maximize the total saving:

      saving = sum_{i} [ if we set table i to c_i, then we save the number of contestants at table i that are dish c_i ]

But note: we cannot have two tables set to the same color? Actually, we can. There is no restriction: multiple tables can be set to 0.

But wait: if we set two tables to 0, then we can leave the 0s at their initial tables? And also, we can move 0s from other tables to either of these 0-tables? But if we move a 0 from table i to table j (which is set to 0), then we do not save the move for that contestant: they are moved (so we don't count saving) but they are not at their initial table.

Therefore, the saving is only for contestants that are at their initial table.

Hence, the saving at table i is only the contestants that are both: 
  1. Initially at table i, 
  2. And we set table i to their dish.

And then we leave them at table i.

Therefore, the saving is independent per table: we don't get saving by moving a contestant to a table that is set to their dish if that table is not their initial table.

So the total saving is:

      saving = sum_{i} ( number of contestants at table i that are dish c_i )

And we wish to maximize saving.

Then the total moves = total_contestants - saving.

But note: we are free to choose c_i for each table. And the choice for one table does not affect the saving at another table? Because the saving at table i only depends on c_i and the counts at table i.

Therefore, the maximum saving we can achieve is:

      saving = sum_{i} max( count0_i, count1_i )

Because for each table i, we choose c_i that gives the maximum saving: either count0_i (if we set to 0) or count1_i (if we set to 1). Then we leave the majority dish at the table and move the minority.

Then the total moves = total_contestants - saving.

But is that correct?

Example: sample input #1.

Input:
4
11101101  -> 8 contestants: count0: 3 (positions: 4,6,8? Actually: 11101101 -> 1's: 6, 0's: 2? 
Wait: 
  S1 = "11101101": 
      positions: 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:0, 5:1, 6:1, 7:0, 8:1 -> count0=2, count1=6 -> max=6.
  S2 = "00": count0=2, count1=0 -> max=2.
  S3 = "10001": 
      '1' at pos1, then '000' at pos2,3,4, then '1' at pos5 -> count0=3, count1=2 -> max=3.
  S4 = "10": count0=1, count1=1 -> max=1.

Total saving = 6+2+3+1 = 12.
Total contestants = 8+2+5+2 = 17.
Moves = 17 - 12 = 5.

Which matches sample output #1.

Let me check sample input #2:

  2
  "101010": count0=3, count1=3 -> max=3.
  "010101": count0=3, count1=3 -> max=3.
  saving = 3+3 = 6.
  total contestants = 6+6 = 12.
  moves = 12 - 6 = 6.

Matches sample output #2.

Sample input #3:

  5
  "0000" -> count0=4, count1=0 -> max=4.
  "11" -> 2
  "0" -> 1
  "00000000" -> 8
  "1" -> 1
  saving = 4+2+1+8+1 = 16.
  total contestants = 4+2+1+8+1 = 16.
  moves = 0.

Therefore, the solution is:

  total_contestants = sum_{i} |S_i|
  saving = sum_{i} max( count0_i, count1_i )
  answer = total_contestants - saving

But note: we assumed we never set a table to empty. Why is that optimal?

  Because for a table i: 
      saving_i = max(count0_i, count1_i) 
      and if we set it to empty, saving_i = 0 (since we leave no one at the table) 
      and 0 <= max(count0_i, count1_i).

  So we get more saving by setting the table to the majority dish.

And we are allowed to do so? And we are allowed to move the minority to other tables? And at those other tables, we can set the table to the dish of the minority? Then we might leave some of the minority at their initial table? But wait: the minority at table i are moved. However, if we move a contestant of dish d to table j, then table j must be set to d. And if table j is set to d, then we can leave the contestants that were initially at table j and are dish d? But the saving for table j is computed independently: we get max(count0_j, count1_j) for table j. And the moved contestant from table i to table j does not add to the saving at table j? Because saving is defined only for contestants that are at their initial table.

Therefore, the moved contestant does not contribute to saving at any table? So we only save for contestants that are at their initial table.

Hence, the solution is:

  total = 0
  saving = 0
  for each string S_i:
      total += len(S_i)
      count0 = count of '0' in S_i
      count1 = len(S_i) - count0
      saving += max(count0, count1)

  answer = total - saving

But note: the constraints: n up to 100,000, and total length of all strings <= 500,000. So we can iterate over each string and count the zeros.

We can do:

  n = int(input())
  total_contestants = 0
  saving = 0
  for i in range(n):
      s = input().strip()
      total_contestants += len(s)
      count0 = s.count('0')
      count1 = len(s) - count0
      saving += max(count0, count1)

  print(total_contestants - saving)

But let me test with the samples.

Sample1: 
  total_contestants = 8+2+5+2 = 17
  saving = max(2,6) [for first] + max(2,0) [second: actually "00" has two zeros] -> max(2,0)=2? Actually, count0=2, count1=0 -> max=2.
        third: "10001": count0=3, count1=2 -> max=3.
        fourth: "10": count0=1, count1=1 -> max=1.
        saving = 6+2+3+1 = 12.
        17-12=5 -> correct.

Sample2: 
  total_contestants = 6+6=12
  saving = max(3,3)=3 for first, max(3,3)=3 for second -> saving=6, moves=6.

Sample3: 
  total_contestants = 4+2+1+8+1=16
  saving = 4 (for "0000") + 2 (for "11") + 1 (for "0") + 8 (for "00000000") + 1 (for "1") = 16 -> moves=0.

Therefore, we have the solution.

But wait: what about the possibility of setting a table to empty? The above solution does not consider it. Why is it optimal?

  Consider: if we set a table to empty, we get saving=0 for that table. But if we set it to the majority, we get saving = max(count0,count1) >=0. So we would never choose empty.

Therefore, the solution is as above.

But note: what if a table has no majority? For example, "01": then max(1,1)=1. Then saving=1. That is better than setting to empty (which gives 0). So we set it to either 0 or 1, and we leave one contestant (the one that matches) and move the other.

Therefore, the code is straightforward.

Complexity: We iterate over each string and count the zeros. The total length is 500,000, so it's O(total_length) which is acceptable.

Let me code the logic in pseudocode:

  n = read_int()
  total = 0
  saving = 0
  for i in range(n):
      s = read_string()
      L = len(s)
      total += L
      count0 = 0
      for char in s:
          if char == '0':
              count0 += 1
      count1 = L - count0
      saving += max(count0, count1)

  answer = total - saving
  print(answer)

But note: we can use built-in count for the string? That is efficient.

In Python, we can do: count0 = s.count('0')

But the problem says the total length is 500,000, so it's acceptable.

However, in C++ we can use std::count, etc.

But the problem does not require code, so we just note the algorithm.

Conclusion:

  The minimum number of moves is total_contestants - sum_{i} max( count0_i, count1_i ).

Why is this correct?

  Because we can set each table to the dish that is the majority at that table, and leave the majority dish contestants at their initial table (so no move for them). Then we move the minority dish contestants to other tables. But note: we are moving them to other tables that are set to their dish? How do we know we have enough tables for the dish they require? 

  Actually, we can assign them to any table that is set to their dish. We are setting each table independently to the majority dish. But we are free to change the assignment? Actually, we are not forced to set a table to the majority dish? We set it to the dish that maximizes the saving at that table. Then we move the minority to tables that are set to the minority dish.

  But what if there is no table set to the minority dish? For example, if we have two tables: 
      Table1: "0" -> we set it to 0 -> saving=1, move the 0? none to move? actually, we leave the 0.
      Table2: "1" -> we set it to 1 -> saving=1, leave the 1.

  Then we don't need to move any contestant? Correct.

  Now, if we have:
      Table1: "01" -> we set it to 0? then we move the 1 to table2? but table2 is set to 1? Then we can move the 1 to table2? and leave the 0 at table1? 
      Table2: "01" -> we set it to 0? then we move the 1 to table1? but table1 is set to 0? 

  This is a problem.

But wait: we set the table to the dish that maximizes the saving. For table1, if we set it to 0, we save 1 (the 0) and if we set it to 1, we save 1 (the 1). Similarly for table2.

But then we have two choices for each table. How do we coordinate?

Actually, we don't need to coordinate: because the saving is only for the contestants that are left at their initial table. The moved contestants are assigned to other tables that are set to their dish. But we have to make sure that there exists a table set to their dish.

But note: we are setting every table to either 0 or 1. And we have at least two tables. 

For a contestant of dish d that we move from table i, we can assign them to any table j that is set to d. Since we set table j to d, and we are allowed to assign arbitrarily many contestants to a table, we can assign arbitrarily many moved contestants to a table as long as it is set to d.

But what if no table is set to d? Then we cannot assign them? 

But we set each table to the dish that maximizes the saving. However, it might happen that we set all tables to 0? Then what about the 1s? 

But note: if a table has at least one 1, then if we set it to 1 we get at least one saving. But if we set it to 0, we get at least one saving only if there is a 0? 

But consider: if we have a contestant of dish 1, then at their initial table, if there is at least one 1, then we have the option to set the table to 1 and get at least one saving (for the 1) and move the 0s? But if we set the table to 0, we move the 1. 

But if we set all tables to 0, then we cannot assign the 1s? 

Therefore, we must have at least one table set to 1? How do we ensure that?

Actually, we don't: because we can set a table to 1 only if it has at least one 1? But if every table has at least one 0? Then we can set every table to 0? Then we have no table set to 1? Then we cannot assign any 1? 

But wait: the problem states that we start with at least one contestant per table. But the contestants that are 1 must be assigned to a table set to 1. So if we set every table to 0, then we cannot assign any 1.

Therefore, the assignment must have at least one table set to 1 if there is at least one 1 in the entire set? Similarly, at least one table set to 0 if there is at least one 0.

But note: we are free to choose the setting. And we are setting each table independently. We must set the tables so that:

  - For every dish d that appears in the entire set, there is at least one table set to d.

However, we are setting each table to maximize the saving. How can we ensure that we have at least one table set to 1 if there is a 1? 

Consider: if there is at least one 1 in the entire set, then there exists at least one table i that has at least one 1. For that table, we can set it to 1 and get saving at least 1 (for that 1) and we avoid the problem? 

But what if we set that table to 0? Then we move the 1 and then we have no table set to 1? 

So we must avoid that.

Therefore, the independent setting per table is not independent? We have a global constraint: we must set at least one table to 1 if there is at least one 1, and at least one table to 0 if there is at least one 0.

But note: if we set a table to 1, we can assign all the 1s to that table? Even if they are from other tables? But we are moving them? So we only need one table set to 1 to handle all the 1s. Similarly, one table set to 0 for all the 0s.

Therefore, we can do:

  - Set one table to 1 arbitrarily? and set the others to maximize saving? 

But that might reduce the saving.

Alternatively, we can force that if there is at least one 1, then we must set at least one table to 1. Similarly for 0.

But note: we have many tables. We can set one table to 1 and the others to maximize saving. But then the table that we set to 1 arbitrarily might not be the one that maximizes the saving? 

How much do we lose? 

But consider: if we have a table i that has a 1, and if we set it to 1, we get saving_i = max_i = count1_i. If we set it to 0, we get saving_i = count0_i. The difference is count1_i - count0_i. So if we force it to 1, we get saving_i = count1_i, but if we set it to 0, we get count0_i. Then we need to set another table to 1? 

But we might have another table j that has a 1. If we set table j to 1, we get saving_j = count1_j, which might be larger than if we set it to 0 (which would be count0_j). 

But what if no table has a majority of 1? Then we set it to 0? Then we have no table set to 1? 

Therefore, we must set at least one table that has at least one 1 to 1. But we can choose which table. 

To minimize the loss, we choose a table i that minimizes the loss (count1_i - count0_i) when we force it to 1? 

Because if we set a table i to 1 even though count0_i > count1_i, then we get saving_i = count1_i, but we could have gotten count0_i if we set it to 0. The loss is count0_i - count1_i.

So to minimize the total loss, we choose the table i that minimizes (count0_i - count1_i) (which is the loss) to force to 1? 

Similarly, for 0: if we need a table set to 0, we choose the table j that minimizes (count1_j - count0_j) to force to 0? 

But note: we might need both: one table forced to 1 and one table forced to 0? 

Therefore, the algorithm:

  Step 1: Compute the total saving without global constraints: saving0 = sum_i max(count0_i, count1_i)

  Step 2: Check if there is at least one 1 in the entire set? 
          total_ones = sum_i count1_i
          if total_ones == 0, then we don't need a table set to 1.

  Similarly, total_zeros = total_contestants - total_ones
          if total_zeros == 0, then we don't need a table set to 0.

  Step 3: If both total_zeros>0 and total_ones>0, then we must ensure that at least one table is set to 1 and at least one table is set to 0.

          Currently, we set each table independently. This might have set no table to 1? How to check?

          Actually, if there is at least one 1, then there is at least one table with at least one 1. But we might set that table to 0? Then we would have no table set to 1? 

          So we need to fix that.

          We can consider: we have saving0 = sum_i max(count0_i, count1_i). But this setting might have set every table to 0? Then we have no table set to 1? 

          Therefore, we need to reduce the saving by the minimal loss to fix the constraint.

          Specifically, we can do:

            Option: 
              saving1 = saving0 - min_{over tables i that have at least one 1} [ max(count0_i, count1_i) - count1_i ]

          Why? Because for a table i, if we set it to 1 (even if it has more 0s than 1s) then the saving we get at table i is count1_i, whereas if we set it to 0 we get count0_i. The difference (loss) is count0_i - count1_i = (max_i - count1_i) because if count0_i>count1_i, then max_i = count0_i, and loss = count0_i - count1_i.

          Similarly, if we set it to 1 when it has more 1s, then max_i = count1_i, so loss = 0.

          Therefore, the loss we incur by forcing table i to 1 is: max_i - count1_i.

          Similarly, we might also need to force a table j to 0? But note: we might need to force both? 

          Actually, we might have set no table to 1 and no table to 0? Then we need to force one table to 1 and one table to 0? 

          But we can do independently: 

            For 1: we choose a table i that minimizes (max_i - count1_i) and force it to 1. Then the saving becomes saving0 - (max_i - count1_i).

            For 0: we choose a table j that minimizes (max_j - count0_j) and force it to 0.

          But what if the same table is chosen for both? Then we cannot? So we have to choose two different tables.

          Therefore, we have two cases:

            Case 1: In the independent setting, there is already at least one table set to 1 and at least one table set to 0? Then we don't need to do anything.

            Case 2: Otherwise, we must fix.

          How to know if the independent setting has at least one table set to 1?

            We set a table to 1 if and only if count1_i >= count0_i. So if there is a table i such that count1_i >= count0_i, then we set it to 1 (so we have at least one table set to 1). Similarly, if there is a table j such that count0_j >= count1_j, then we set it to 0 (so we have at least one table set to 0) [note: if a table has count0_i = count1_i, we set it to either, so we have both?].

          But note: if we have a table with count0_i = count1_i, we set it to either? Actually, we set it to the one that gives the max saving, which is count0_i or count1_i, both equal. So we choose arbitrarily? Then we might choose 0 for one such table and 1 for another? 

          Actually, we are doing independently: each table is set arbitrarily to the majority? But in the tie, we can choose either. But the saving is the same. However, we care about the existence of a 0-table and a 1-table.

          Therefore, we can check:

            has0 = False
            has1 = False

            for each table i:
                if count0_i >= count1_i: # we set it to 0? 
                    then we mark that we have a 0-table? 
                if count1_i >= count0_i: # we set it to 1?
                    then we mark that we have a 1-table?

          Actually, for a table, if count0_i >= count1_i, we set it to 0 -> then it becomes a 0-table.
          if count1_i >= count0_i, we set it to 1 -> then it becomes a 1-table? 

          But note: if count0_i == count1_i, then we set it to either? Then we can choose to set it to 0 to get a 0-table, or to 1 to get a 1-table? 

          Therefore, if there is a table with count0_i == count1_i, then we can set it to 0 and then we have a 0-table, and also we can set another table (if needed) to 1? Actually, that one table can be set arbitrarily to either. But we only need one table for each dish.

          So:

            If there is at least one table set to 0 in the independent assignment? We check: if there exists a table i with count0_i>=count1_i? Then we have a 0-table.

            Similarly, if there exists a table j with count1_j>=count0_j, then we have a 1-table.

          But note: every table has count0_i+count1_i>=1. And we set it to 0 if count0_i>=count1_i, to 1 if count1_i>=count0_i? Actually, both conditions can be true? Then we set it to one arbitrarily? But we can decide arbitrarily? 

          However, for the purpose of having at least one 0-table and one 1-table, we can check:

            has0 = False
            has1 = False
            for each table i:
                if count0_i >= count1_i: 
                    has0 = True
                if count1_i >= count0_i:
                    has1 = True

          Then if (has0 and has1), we are done: saving = saving0.

          Else if (not has0) and (not has1): 
            This is impossible? Because each table has at least one contestant, so if we set a table to 0 if count0_i>=count1_i, then if we have no table with count0_i>=count1_i, that means for every table, count1_i>count0_i. Then we set every table to 1 -> then has1=True, but has0=False? 

          Actually, the condition "not has0" means: for every table i, count0_i < count1_i -> then we set every table to 1 -> then we have no table set to 0? But we need a table set to 0? 

          Similarly, if not has1, then we set every table to 0 -> then we have no table set to 1.

          Therefore, we have:

            If (total_zeros>0 and not has0) OR (total_ones>0 and not has1) then we need to fix.

          Specifically:

            If total_zeros>0 and not has0: then we must force one table to 0. 
            Similarly, if total_ones>0 and not has1: then we must force one table to 1.

          But note: if both are missing, we need to force two tables? 

          How much loss?

            For forcing a table to 0: we choose the table i that minimizes (max_i - count0_i) = (count1_i - count0_i) [because at that table, we set it to 0: saving becomes count0_i, but we could have had count1_i].

            Similarly, for forcing to 1: we choose j that minimizes (count0_j - count1_j) = (max_j - count1_j) [if we set it to 1, saving becomes count1_i, but we could have had count0_i].

          And if we need to force both, we choose two different tables? 

          Therefore, we do:

            loss0 = a big number
            loss1 = a big number

            if total_zeros>0 and not has0:
                for each table i:
                    # we are going to force it to 0? 
                    loss_candidate = max(count0_i, count1_i) - count0_i   # = count1_i - count0_i   [because max=count1_i]
                    # but note: if we set it to 0, saving at table i becomes count0_i, which is saving0_i (which was max=count1_i) minus loss_candidate.
                    # we want to minimize the loss_candidate.
                loss0 = min(loss0, loss_candidate over tables i)

            Similarly, if total_ones>0 and not has1:
                for each table i:
                    loss_candidate = max(count0_i, count1_i) - count1_i   # = count0_i - count1_i   [because max=count0_i]
                loss1 = min(loss1, loss_candidate over tables i)

            Then total_loss = loss0 + loss1   # if we need both? but note: we might need only one.

          But wait: if we need to force one table to 0, then we subtract loss0 from saving0? 

          Then saving = saving0 - loss0 (if we only need to force to 0) 
          or saving = saving0 - loss1 (if we only need to force to 1)
          or saving = saving0 - loss0 - loss1 (if we need both)

          Then moves = total_contestants - saving.

          But note: we cannot force the same table for both? Because if we force a table to 0, then we set it to 0. Then we cannot also force it to 1? So we must choose two different tables.

          However, the loss0 and loss1 we computed are over all tables. We can choose two different tables? 

          Therefore, we can compute:

            loss0 = a big number
            loss1 = a big number

            candidate_table0 = None
            candidate_table1 = None

            if total_zeros>0 and not has0:
                for each table i:
                    loss_candidate = max(count0_i, count1_i) - count0_i   # = count1_i - count0_i
                    if loss_candidate < loss0:
                        loss0 = loss_candidate
                        candidate_table0 = i

            if total_ones>0 and not has1:
                for each table i:
                    loss_candidate = max(count0_i, count1_i) - count1_i   # = count0_i - count1_i
                    if loss_candidate < loss1:
                        loss1 = loss_candidate
                        candidate_table1 = i

            Then if candidate_table0 and candidate_table1 are the same? Then we have to choose two different tables? 

            How to handle that? 

            We can do:

              Option1: force candidate_table0 to 0 and candidate_table1 to 1? But if they are the same, we cannot.

              Then we have to choose two different tables. We can consider:

                Option: choose table i for 0 and table j for 1 (i != j) to minimize the total loss = (max_i - count0_i) + (max_j - count1_j)

                We already have the best for 0 and the best for 1. But if the best for 0 and best for 1 are the same table, then we need the next best for one of them.

            Therefore, we can also compute:

                loss0_second = a big number
                loss1_second = a big number

                and the next best candidate.

            Alternatively, we can consider:

                total_loss = min( 
                    loss0 (for table i0) + loss1 (for table i1) for i0 != i1,
                    and if we can find two different tables, then that is the minimal total loss.

                But we can compute:

                    Let A = list of loss0 for all tables (if we force to 0) = (max_i - count0_i) for each table i.
                    Let B = list of loss1 for all tables (if we force to 1) = (max_i - count1_i) for each table i.

                Then we want to choose one table from A and one table from B (different) such that the sum is minimized.

                But note: we are forced to do one for 0 and one for 1? 

                Then:

                    total_loss = min_{i != j} [ A_i + B_j ]

                But we can do:

                    We can take the minimum A_i and the minimum B_j, and if the table i and j are different, then total_loss = minA + minB.

                    If the table that minimizes A_i is the same as the one that minimizes B_j, then we take min( minA + second_minB, minB + second_minA )

            However, the problem states: the total_contestants is at most 500000, and n<=100000. We can do:

                loss0_list = []
                loss1_list = []

                for each table i:
                    if total_zeros>0 and not has0:
                        loss0_i = max(count0_i, count1_i) - count0_i
                        loss0_list.append( (loss0_i, i) )
                    if total_ones>0 and not has1:
                        loss1_i = max(count0_i, count1_i) - count1_i
                        loss1_list.append( (loss1_i, i) )

                Then sort loss0_list and loss1_list by the loss.

                Then if we need both:

                    candidate = a big number
                    # Option: choose the best for 0 and the best for 1 that are different.
                    if loss0_list[0][1] != loss1_list[0][1]:
                        candidate = loss0_list[0][0] + loss1_list[0][0]
                    else:
                        # Option1: best for 0 and second best for 1
                        if len(loss1_list) >= 2:
                            candidate = min(candidate, loss0_list[0][0] + loss1_list[1][0])
                        # Option2: second best for 0 and best for 1
                        if len(loss0_list) >= 2:
                            candidate = min(candidate, loss0_list[1][0] + loss1_list[0][0])

                    total_loss = candidate

                Then saving = saving0 - total_loss

          But note: if we only need to force one, then total_loss is either loss0 or loss1.

  Then moves = total_contestants - saving = total_contestants - (saving0 - total_loss)

But let me test with the example: sample input #2.

  Input: 
      2
      "101010" -> count0=3, count1=3 -> max=3.
      "010101" -> count0=3, count1=3 -> max=3.

      saving0 = 3+3 = 6.

      Now, check: 
          has0: for table1: count0=3>=count1=3 -> True -> we set it to 0? (or 1? we can choose arbitrarily) -> so we have a 0-table? 
          has1: for table1: count1=3>=count0=3 -> True -> we set it to 1? 
          Actually, we can choose. But we only need one table to be 0 and one to be 1? 

          How do we know what we set? 

          We set each table to the majority? But in a tie, we can choose arbitrarily. 

          But the problem: we need both a 0-table and a 1-table.

          We can set table1 to 0 and table2 to 1? Then we have both? 

          So has0 and has1 are both true? 

          Therefore, we don't need to fix.

          Then saving = 6, moves=6.

  But what if we set both to 0? Then we have no table set to 1? Then we cannot assign the 1s? 

  But the independent assignment per table: we set table1 to the majority -> tie -> we choose 0? Then table2: tie -> we choose 0? Then we have no table set to 1? 

  Therefore, we must fix.

  How to compute:

      total_zeros = 6, total_ones=6 -> both>0.

      Check has0: 
          table1: count0=3>=count1=3 -> True -> so we mark has0=True? 
          table2: count0=3>=count1=3 -> True -> so we mark has0=True.

      Check has1:
          table1: count1=3>=count0=3 -> True -> has1=True.
          table2: same.

      So we have both? Then we don't fix.

  But wait: we can set table1 to 0 and table2 to 1? Then we have both. 

  The issue: in the independent assignment, we are free to choose in the tie? So we can choose table1 to 0 and table2 to 1? Then we have both.

  Therefore, we must design the independent assignment to break ties in a way that ensures we have both if both are present? 

  How? 

      We can break the tie arbitrarily. But we want to maximize the saving and also satisfy the global constraint.

      We can break the tie as follows: 

          For a table with count0_i = count1_i, we set it to 0 if we have not set a 0-table yet? and 1 if we have set a 0-table but not a 1-table? 

      But we are doing independently per table? 

  Alternatively, we can avoid the complex global constraint by noting:

      The problem: we might set all tables to one color if there is no table that naturally has a majority for the other color? 

      But the sample input #2: each table has a tie, so we can choose arbitrarily. Then we can set one to 0 and one to 1? 

      How do we know in the independent assignment that we have both? 

      We can simulate: 

          We set each table to the majority, and in tie, we set arbitrarily? But we can choose arbitrarily to our advantage.

      Therefore, we can assume that in the independent assignment we break ties optimally to have both a 0-table and a 1-table if possible.

      How? 

          If there exists at least two tables with tie? Then we can set one to 0 and one to 1.

          Or if there exists one table that is not a tie that is set to 0 and one that is set to 1, then we are done.

          Or if there is one table that is not a tie set to 0, and a tie table, then we set the tie table to 1.

      Actually, we can do:

          has0 = False
          has1 = False

          For each table i:
              if count0_i > count1_i:
                  we set to 0 -> has0 = True
              elif count1_i > count0_i:
                  we set to 1 -> has1 = True
              else: # tie
                  # we can postpone: we will use these to fill the missing color.

          Then after we process all, for each tie table:
              if not has0 and not has1: # then we set the first tie table to 0 and the next to 1? 
              else if not has0: set to 0 -> has0=True
              else if not has1: set to 1 -> has1=True
              else: set arbitrarily (to 0 or 1) -> no effect.

      But this is a global decision? 

  However, the problem: the saving is fixed for a tie table: 3 for both choices.

  Therefore, we can break ties arbitrarily. But we can choose the assignment to ensure we have both a 0 and a 1 table.

  Since the saving is the same regardless of the choice, we can choose to set one tie table to 0 and one to 1 to get both colors.

  Therefore, after the independent assignment (which sets a table to the majority and in tie we don't care), we can check:

      if (there is at least one 0 in the entire set and not has0) OR (at least one 1 and not has1), then we must have that every table with a tie was set to the same color? And there is no table that naturally set to the missing color? 

  But we can reassign one tie table to the missing color without loss of saving? 

      Because if we change a tie table from 0 to 1, we get the same saving? 

  Therefore, if we initially set all tie tables to 0, and then we need a 1-table, we can change one of them to 1? without changing the saving.

      Because for a tie table: if we set it to 0, saving=3; if we set it to 1, saving=3.

  Then there is no loss? 

  Therefore, we don't need to subtract any loss? 

  Then the saving remains saving0.

  And we can have both a 0-table and a 1-table by reassigning one tie table from 0 to 1? 

  But then the saving is unchanged.

  Therefore, the only time we incur a loss is when we force a table that is not a tie to the minority dish? 

  And if we only have tie tables, then we can assign them to different colors without loss.

  So the algorithm:

      saving0 = sum_i max(count0_i, count1_i)   [which for a tie table is count0_i (or count1_i) and they are equal]

      Check:

        has0 = False
        has1 = False

        for each table i:
            if count0_i > count1_i:
                has0 = True
            if count1_i > count0_i:
                has1 = True

        # For tie tables: we don't know yet, but we can use them to fill the gap without loss.

        if (total_zeros>0 and not has0) or (total_ones>0 and not has1):
            # But we have tie tables? They can be used to fill the gap without loss.
            # However, if there is no tie table and we are missing a color, then we have to force a non-tie table to the minority.

            # Actually, if we are missing has0, and there is a tie table, then we don't need to force? because we can set one tie table to 0.
            # Therefore, we only need to force if there is no table that is either a natural 0-table or a tie table? 

            # But note: we have at least one table per dish initially? 

            # Actually, if we are missing has0, it means there is no table with count0_i>=count1_i? but wait, tie is count0_i=count1_i, so we have no table with count0_i>=count1_i? 
            # But we have tie tables? Then we do have tables with count0_i>=count1_i? 

            # Therefore, if we are missing has0, then there is no table with count0_i>=count1_i? which means no tie table either? 

            # Similarly for has1.

            # Therefore, if (total_zeros>0 and not has0) then there is no table i with count0_i>=count1_i. Then every table has count1_i>count0_i.

            # Then we have to force one table to 0.

            # Similarly for has1.

            loss = 0
            if total_zeros>0 and not has0:
                min_loss = a big number
                for each table i:
                    # currently set to 1 (because count1_i>count0_i), and saving_i = count1_i.
                    # if we force to 0, saving_i becomes count0_i, loss = count1_i - count0_i.
                    min_loss = min(min_loss, count1_i - count0_i)
                loss += min_loss

            if total_ones>0 and not has1:
                min_loss = a big number
                for each table i:
                    # currently set to 0, saving_i = count0_i.
                    # if we force to 1, saving_i becomes count1_i, loss = count0_i - count1_i.
                    min_loss = min(min_loss, count0_i - count1_i)
                loss += min_loss

            saving = saving0 - loss

        else:
            saving = saving0

      Then moves = total_contestants - saving.

  Let me test with a small example that requires force:

      n=2
      Table1: "1"  (count0=0, count1=1) -> has1=True, has0=False? but we need has0? 
          total_zeros = 0? because only one contestant? 
          total_zeros = 0, so we don't need a 0-table.

          Then we are done.

      Example requiring force:

        n=2
        Table1: "111" -> count0=0, count1=3 -> naturally set to 1 -> has1=True, has0=False.
        Table2: "111" -> count0=0, count1=3 -> set to 1 -> has0 is still false.

        But total_zeros=0? -> we don't need a 0-table.

        So we are done.

      Another example:

        n=2
        Table1: "111" -> count0=0, count1=3 -> has1=True, has0=False.
        Table2: "11" -> count0=0, count1=2 -> has1=True, has0=False.

        total_zeros=0 -> no need for 0-table.

      Example with need for 0-table:

        n=1? but n>=2.

        n=2, total_zeros>0 and not has0:

          Table1: "110" -> count0=1, count1=2 -> set to 1 -> has1=True, has0=False.
          Table2: "110" -> count0=1, count1=2 -> set to 1 -> has0=False.

          total_zeros = 2>0, and has0=False.

          Then we need to force one table to 0.

          For table1: loss = count1_1 - count0_1 = 2-1 = 1.
          For table2: loss = 2-1=1.

          We choose one table, say table1, and force to 0: then loss=1.

          saving0 = max(1,2) for table1 (which is 2) + max(1,2) for table2 (which is 2) = 4.
          saving = 4 - 1 = 3.

          total_contestants = 3+3 = 6.
          moves = 6-3 = 3.

          But is that minimal?

          What if we set table1 to 0: then we must move the two 1s to table2? but table2 is set to 1? 
          Then we leave the 0 at table1? 
          And at table2: we have its own two 1s and the two 1s from table1? and we also have the 0 from table2? -> we cannot.

          How about: 
            We set table1 to 0: then we move the two 1s from table1 to table2? and we set table2 to 1, but then we must move the 0 from table2 to table1? 
            Then we have:
                table1: the 0 from table1 and the 0 from table2? -> then it is 0-table? 
                table2: the two 1s from table1 and the two 1s from table2? -> 1-table.

            Moves: the two 1s from table1 (2 moves) and the 0 from table2 (1 move) -> total 3 moves.

          But what if we set table1 to 1 and table2 to 0? 
            Then we move the 0 from table1 to table2? and the two 1s from table2 to table1? 
            Moves: 0 from table1 (1 move) and two 1s from table2 (2 moves) -> 3 moves.

          So it is 3 moves.

          Therefore, our algorithm works.

  Therefore, the final solution:

    total_contestants = 0
    saving0 = 0
    has0 = False   # if there is a table with count0_i > count1_i
    has1 = False   # if there is a table with count1_i > count0_i
    total_zeros = 0
    total_ones = 0

    For each string S_i:
        L = len(S_i)
        total_contestants += L
        count0 = count of '0' in S_i
        count1 = L - count0
        saving0 += max(count0, count1)

        if count0 > count1:
            has0 = True
        if count1 > count0:
            has1 = True

        total_zeros += count0
        total_ones += count1

    # Now, if there are zeros in the entire set? and we don't have a natural 0-table? and we also don't have a tie table? then we have to force a table to 0.
    # But note: if there is a tie table, we can set it to 0 without loss. So we only need to force if there is no table with count0_i>=count1_i? 
    # Actually, we have has0=False means no table has count0_i>count1_i. But a tie table has count0_i==count1_i, and we didn't set has0 from it.
    # But we can use a tie table for 0 without loss? so we don't need to force.

    # Therefore, we only need to force if:
    #   (total_zeros>0 and (not has0) and there is no tie table) -> but wait, we don't track tie tables.

    # Actually, we don't need to force if there is any table i with count0_i>=count1_i? 
    # But we have: if there is a table with count0_i>=count1_i, then we don't need to force for 0? because we can set it to 0 and get at least count0_i saving? 
    # But note: if the table has count0_i>=count1_i, then we can set it to 0. So if there is at least one table with count0_i>=count1_i, then we have a 0-table? 

    # However, if there is a tie table, then we can set it to 0 -> then we have a 0-table.

    # Therefore, the only time we need to force a 0-table is if there is no table i with count0_i>=count1_i? 
    # But that is exactly when not has0 and there is no tie table? 
    # But we didn't check for tie tables.

    # How to check for tie tables? 
    #   We can set a flag: 
    #       has_tie = False
    #       for any table i: if count0_i == count1_i, then has_tie = True.

    #   Then if (total_zeros>0 and not has0 and not has_tie) -> then we need to force a 0-table.

    # But note: if there is a tie table, we can use it as a 0-table? and we don't incur a loss? 
    #   So we don't need to force.

    # Alternatively, we can do: 
    #   need0 = (total_zeros>0 and not (has0 or has_tie))   ?  -> no, because if there is a tie, we can get a 0-table without loss.

    # Actually, we can reexamine:

    #   We need a 0-table if there is at least one 0. 
    #   We can have a 0-table if there is a table i such that we set it to 0.
    #   We can set a table i to 0 if count0_i>=count1_i? -> then we don't incur a loss? 
    #   Or if count0_i<count1_i, then we incur a loss = count1_i - count0_i.

    #   But we have already computed the saving0 under the condition of setting each table to the majority.

    #   And then we check: in that assignment, do we have a 0-table? 
    #       We have a 0-table in the assignment if there is a table i that we set to 0, which happens if count0_i>=count1_i.

    #   But if there is no table set to 0, then we have to change one table that was set to 1 to 0, and we incur a loss = (max_i - count0_i) for that table.

    #   And we choose the table that minimizes that loss.

    #   And we don't care about tie because in the initial assignment we set a tie table to either 0 or 1? but if we set it to 0, then we have a 0-table? 
    #   So if there is a tie table, then we must have set it to 0 or 1? 
    #   And if we set it to 0, then we have a 0-table? 
    #   Or if we set it to 1, then we don't have a 0-table? 
    #   But we can reassign it to 0 without loss? so why would we not have a 0-table in the initial assignment? 

    #   Actually, in the initial assignment, we set it to the majority? and in tie, we set arbitrarily? 
    #   But our has0 and has1 are computed based on the natural majority (without tie) or on the setting? 

    #   Let me redefine:

        In the initial assignment, for table i:
            if count0_i > count1_i: 
                we set to 0 -> then we mark: this table is a 0-table.
            if count1_i > count0_i:
                we set to 1 -> then we mark: this table is a 1-table.
            if tie: we set to 0 or 1 arbitrarily? then if we set to 0, then it is a 0-table, if to 1, then 1-table.

        But we are free to choose in the tie. So we can choose to set one tie table to 0 to make it a 0-table.

        Therefore, after processing, if there is a tie table, then we can ensure we have a 0-table by setting at least one tie table to 0.

        Similarly for 1.

        Therefore, the only time we don't have a 0-table is if there is no table with count0_i>=count1_i? including tie? -> no, tie has count0_i=count1_i, so it is count0_i>=count1_i.

        But wait: our has0 was defined as: if there is a table with count0_i>count1_i. We didn't include tie.

        So we need to redefine:

            We will have a 0-table in the assignment (if we want) if there is a table i with count0_i>=count1_i.

            But we don't have to force if there is at least one table with count0_i>=count1_i, because we can set that table to 0.

        Therefore, we only need to force if there is no table i with count0_i>=count1_i.

        Similarly, we only need to force a 1-table if there is no table i with count1_i>=count0_i.

        But note: every table has count0_i+count1_i>=1, so count0_i>=count1_i or count1_i>=count0_i is always true? 
            Because either count0_i>=count1_i or count1_i>count0_i.

        Then we will always have a table with count0_i>=count1_i OR count1_i>=count0_i.

        And if we set it to the majority, we get saving.

        But for the global constraint: we need a 0-table if there is at least one 0? 

            If there is a table i with count0_i>=count1_i, then we can set it to 0 -> then we have a 0-table.

            Similarly, if there is a table i with count1_i>=count0_i, then we can set it to 1 -> then we have a 1-table.

        Therefore, we will always have a 0-table if there is at least one 0? and a 1-table if there is at least one 1? 

        How? 

          If there is at least one 0 in the entire set, then there is at least one table i that has at least one 0. 

          For that table i, we have count0_i>=1. But what about count1_i? 

          We have two cases:
            If count1_i >= count0_i, then we set it to 1? -> then it is a 1-table, and we move the 0? 
            If count0_i > count1_i, then we set it to 0? -> then it is a 0-table.

          But if we set it to 1, then the 0 at that table is moved. Then we hope that there is a 0-table elsewhere? 

          How do we ensure there is a 0-table? 

          There might be another table j that has count0_j > count1_j? then we set it to 0.

          Or if there is no such table, then every table j has count1_j>=count0_j? and then we set every table to 1? then we have no 0-table? 

        This is the issue we had earlier.

        Therefore, we must force one table to 0? 

        But note: if every table i has count1_i>=count0_i, then for a table i, we set it to 1. Then we have no 0-table. 

        And if there is at least one 0 (so total_zeros>0), then we need a 0-table.

        Therefore, we only need to force if:

            (total_zeros>0 and there is no table i with count0_i>=count1_i) -> but this is impossible? 
                Because if a table has a 0, then count0_i>=1, and if count1_i>=count0_i, then count1_i>=1, but we cannot have count0_i>=count1_i and count1_i>=count0_i only when equal? 

            Let me rephrase: 
                We need to force a 0-table if in the entire set, there is at least one 0 and there is no table i such that we set it to 0 in the independent assignment? 

            But the independent assignment sets a table to 0 if count0_i>=count1_i? 

            So if there is no table i with count0_i>=count1_i, then we set every table to 1? 

            And if there is at least one 0, then we need to force.

        Therefore, the condition for force for 0 is: (total_zeros>0 and there is no table i with count0_i>=count1_i)

        But wait: a table i that has count0_i>=count1_i exists if and only if there is a table i with count0_i>=count1_i.

        And if there is no such table, then for every table i, count0_i < count1_i.

        Then we set every table to 1.

        Then we have to force one table to 0, incurring a loss.

        Similarly for 1.

        Therefore, we don't need the has0 from before (which was for natural >), but we need to know if there is any table set to 0 in the independent assignment? which is: we set it to 0 if count0_i>=count1_i.

        But then we have a 0-table? 

        So we can compute:

            has0_assignment = False
            has1_assignment = False

            for each table i:
                if count0_i >= count1_i:
                    # we set it to 0 in the independent assignment? 
                    has0_assignment = True
                if count1_i >= count0_i:
                    # we set it to 1 in the independent assignment? 
                    has1_assignment = True

            Note: a tie will make both true.

        Then:
            if total_zeros>0 and not has0_assignment: then we need to force a 0-table.
            if total_ones>0 and not has1_assignment: then we need to force a 1-table.

        And then incur the loss.

        But note: has0_assignment and has1_assignment: 
            has0_assignment is true if there is at least one table i with count0_i>=count1_i.
            has1_assignment is true if there is at least one table i with count1_i>=count0_i.

        And it is possible that both are true? 

        Then no force.

        It is possible that only one is true.

        And it is possible that has0_assignment is true and has1_assignment is false? 
            That happens if every table has count0_i>=count1_i and at least one table has count0_i>count1_i? and no table has count1_i>count0_i? 

        But then we set every table to 0? then we have no 1-table? and if there is a 1, we need to force.

        Therefore, the conditions are:

            force0 = (total_zeros>0 and not has0_assignment)
            force1 = (total_ones>0 and not has1_assignment)

        And the loss is computed as before.

  Therefore, the algorithm:

    total_contestants = 0
    saving0 = 0
    has0_assignment = False   # at least one table with count0_i>=count1_i
    has1_assignment = False   # at least one table with count1_i>=count0_i
    total_zeros = 0
    total_ones = 0
    list_force0 = []   # for each table, if we force to 0, the loss = (max_i - count0_i) = count1_i - count0_i (because max_i = count1_i, since count1_i>count0_i for tables that are not in the condition count0_i>=count1_i)
    list_force1 = []   # loss = count0_i - count1_i

    for each string S_i:
        L = len(S_i)
        total_contestants += L
        count0 = count of '0' in S_i
        count1 = L - count0
        saving0 += max(count0, count1)

        if count0 >= count1:
            has0_assignment = True
        if count1 >= count0:
            has1_assignment = True

        total_zeros += count0
        total_ones += count1

        # Prepare for force: 
        if count0 < count1: 
            # if we force this table to 0, loss = count1 - count0
            list_force0.append(count1 - count0)
        else:
            # This table is not in the state that would be forced to 0? because we have count0>=count1, so we can set to 0 naturally.
            pass

        if count1 < count0:
            # if we force to 1, loss = count0 - count1
            list_force1.append(count0 - count1)
        else:
            pass

    force0 = (total_zeros>0 and not has0_assignment)
    force1 = (total_ones>0 and not has1_assignment)

    loss = 0
    if force0:
        # find the minimal loss in list_force0
        if not list_force0: 
            # This should not happen: because if we have to force0, then there is no table with count0>=count1, then every table has count0<count1, then list_force0 has an entry for every table.
            min_loss = 10**18
            # but we should have at least one table? 
        else:
            min_loss = min(list_force0)
        loss += min_loss

    if force1:
        if not list_force1:
            min_loss = 10**18
        else:
            min_loss = min(list_force1)
        loss += min_loss

    saving = saving0 - loss
    moves = total_contestants - saving
    output moves

  Let me test with the earlier example that requires force0:

      Tables: 
          Table1: "110" -> count0=1, count1=2 -> count0<count1 -> list_force0 = [2-1=1]
          Table2: "110" -> count0=1, count1=2 -> list_force0 = [1, 1] (so we append 1 again)

          has0_assignment: 
              table1: count0=1>=count1=2? no -> so has0_assignment remains false? 
              table2: similarly, false.
          So has0_assignment = False.

          total_zeros = 1+1 = 2>0 -> force0 = True.

          loss = min(list_force0) = 1.

          saving0 = max(1,2)+max(1,2)=2+2=4.
          saving = 4-1=3.
          moves = (3+3) - 3 = 3.

  Test with sample input #1 and #2: they should not incur force.

  Sample input #1:

    Table1: "11101101" -> count0=2, count1=6 -> 2<6? so we set it to 1? 
             count0>=count1? no, count1>=count0? yes -> has1_assignment=true.
             list_force0: 6-2=4 -> list_force0=[4]
    Table2: "00" -> count0=2, count1=0 -> 2>=0 -> has0_assignment=true.
             list_force1: not applicable (because count1=0<count0=2, so we would add 2-0=2? but wait: count1<count0 -> then we add for force1: count0-count1=2-0=2? 
    Table3: "10001" -> count0=3, count1=2 -> 3>=2 -> has0_assignment=true.
             list_force1: we add 3-2=1
    Table4: "10" -> count0=1, count1=1 -> both are 1, so 
             count0>=count1: true -> has0_assignment=true.
             count1>=count0: true -> has1_assignment=true.
             list_force0: not applicable? because count0>=count1? 
             list_force1: not applicable? 

    force0 = (total_zeros>0 and not has0_assignment) -> has0_assignment=true, so false.
    force1 = (total_ones>0 and not has1_assignment) -> has1_assignment=true, so false.

    Then saving = saving0 = 6+2+3+1=12, moves=17-12=5.

  Sample input #2:

    Table1: "101010": count0=3, count1=3 -> has0_assignment=true, has1_assignment=true.
    Table2: "010101": same.

    Then no force.

  But what if we have a chain of dependencies? 

  However, note: the conditions has0_assignment and has1_assignment are global: 
      has0_assignment is true if there is at least one table i with count0_i>=count1_i.
      has1_assignment is true if there is at least one table i with count1_i>=count0_i.

  In sample input #2, both are true.

  Therefore, we output the moves = 12 - 6 = 6.

  This matches.

  But what if we have a more complex example that requires two forces?

      n=2
      Table1: "111000" -> count0=3, count1=3 -> then has0_assignment=true, has1_assignment=true. -> no force.
      But what if:

        Table1: "111000" -> count0=3, count1=3 -> tie -> both true.
        Table2: "111000" -> tie -> both true.

      Then no force.

      But if:

        Table1: "1110" -> count0=1, count1=3 -> count0<count1 -> so we have: 
            has0_assignment: false? 
            has1_assignment: true.
        Table2: "1110" -> same.

        total_zeros = 1+1=2>0.
        has0_assignment = false -> so force0.
        list_force0: for table1: 3-1=2, table2: 3-1=2 -> loss=2.

        saving0 = max(1,3) + max(1,3) = 3+3=6.
        saving = 6-2=4.
        moves = 8-4=4.

        Is that minimal?

        We can do:
            Set one table to 0: 
                Table1: set to 0: we must move the 3 ones to table2? and table2 is set to 1? 
                Then table1: the 0 from table1 and the 0 from table2? 
                Table2: the 3 ones from table1 and the 3 ones from table2? 
                Moves: move the 3 ones from table1 to table2 (3 moves) and the 0 from table2 to table1 (1 move) -> 4 moves.

            Or set table1 to 0 and table2 to 0: 
                Then move the 3 ones from table1 to table2? but table2 is set to 0? then we cannot.
                So we move the 3 ones from table1 to a new table? but we only have 2 tables.

            How about: 
                Set table1 to 0: then move the 3 ones from table1 to table2? and then set table2 to 1? but then the 0 in table2 must be moved to table1? 
                Then we have:
                    table1: the 0 from table1 and the 0 from table2? 
                    table2: the 3 ones from table1 and the 3 ones from table2? 
                Moves: 3+1=4.

            So 4 moves.

        Therefore, the answer is 4.

  Therefore, the algorithm is complete.

  However, note: we may need to force both a 0-table and a 1-table? 

      Example: 
          Table1: "111"  -> count0=0, count1=3 -> then has0_assignment: false (because 0<3 is not >=) -> but wait: 0>=3? no. 
          Table2: "000"  -> count0=3, count1=0 -> has1_assignment: false.

          Then we need to force both? 

          For table1: if we force to 0, loss = 3-0=3.
          For table2: if we force to 1, loss = 3-0=3.

          But we can do: 
                force table1 to 0: then saving1 = 0 (instead of 3) -> loss=3.
                force table2 to 1: then saving2 = 0 (instead of 3) -> loss=3.
                total loss=6.

          saving0 = 3+3=6, saving=0.
          moves = 6-0=6? 

          But wait: total_contestants=6, saving=0 -> moves=6.

          Alternatively, is there a better way? 

          We could not force? 

          We set table1 to 1 and table2 to 0? then we leave everyone? saving=3+3=6, moves=0? 

          But wait: we have has0_assignment: table2: count0=3>=count1=0 -> true, so has0_assignment=true.
                   table1: count1=3>=count0=0 -> true, so has1_assignment=true.

          Therefore, we do not force.

          Why did we mark as not needing force? 

          In the condition for has0_assignment: table2: count0=3>=count1=0 -> true, so we set has0_assignment=true.
          Similarly, table1: count1=3>=count0=0 -> true, so has1_assignment=true.

          Then no force.

          saving0 = 3+3=6, moves=0.

      So what was the issue in our example? 

          We said: 
            if count0>=count1 -> then has0_assignment=true.

          In table1: count0=0, count1=3 -> 0>=3? false.
          In table2: count0=3, count1=0 -> 3>=0 -> true.

          Then has0_assignment=true.

          But table1: count1=3>=count0=0 -> true -> has1_assignment=true.

          Then no force.

      Therefore, we don't force.

      And the assignment: 
          table1: set to 1? (because count1>count0) -> saving=3.
          table2: set to 0? saving=3.

          total saving=6, moves=0.

      Which is correct.

  Therefore, the only time we force is when there is no table that we can set to 0 without loss? that is, no table has count0_i>=count1_i? 
      then we have to pick a table that we set to 0 and incur the loss.

  Similarly for 1.

  And it is possible that we force one or both.

  Final code:

    n = int(input().strip())
    total_contestants = 0
    saving0 = 0
    has0 = False
    has1 = False
    total_zeros = 0
    total_ones = 0
    list_force0 = []   # will store the loss if we force this table to 0: only for tables that have count0_i < count1_i
    list_force1 = []   # for tables that have count1_i < count0_i

    for i in range(n):
        s = input().strip()
        L = len(s)
        total_contestants += L
        count0 = s.count('0')
        count1 = L - count0
        total_zeros += count0
        total_ones += count1
        saving0 += max(count0, count1)

        if count0 >= count1:
            has0 = True
        if count1 >= count0:
            has1 = True

        if count0 < count1:
            # This table would be set to 1 in the independent assignment. Forcing it to 0 would incur loss = count1 - count0.
            list_force0.append(count1 - count0)
        if count1 < count0:
            list_force1.append(count0 - count1)

    need_force0 = (total_zeros > 0) and (not has0)
    need_force1 = (total_ones > 0) and (not has1)

    loss = 0
    if need_force0:
        if list_force0:
            loss += min(list_force0)
        else:
            # This should not happen, because if there is no table with count0>=count1, then every table has count0<count1? 
            # But it is possible that there is a table with count0>=count1? then has0=true, so we wouldn't get here.
            # So we set a big loss? 
            loss += 10**18

    if need_force1:
        if list_force1:
            loss += min(list_force1)
        else:
            loss += 10**18

    saving = saving0 - loss
    moves = total_contestants - saving
    # But moves should be nonnegative? 
    print(moves)

  Let me test with a known failure: 
      n=2, 
        Table1: "111" -> count0=0, count1=3 -> 
            has0: 0>=3? false -> has0 remains false.
            has1: 3>=0? true -> has1=true.
            list_force0: count0<count1 -> 3-0=3 -> list_force0=[3]
        Table2: "000" -> 
            has0: 3>=0? true -> has0=true.
            has1: 0>=3? false -> 
            list_force1: count1<count0? 0<3 -> 3-0=3 -> list_force1=[3]

        total_zeros=3>0, but has0=true -> no force0.
        total_ones=3>0, has1=true -> no force1.

        moves = (3+3) - (3+3) = 0.

  But if we have:
      n=2,
        Table1: "111" -> count0=0, count1=3: 
            has0=false, has1=true.
            list_force0 = [3]
        Table2: "111" -> 
            has0=false, has1=true.
            list_force0 = [3,3]

        Then force0: (total_zeros=0 -> false) so no force0.
        force1: (total_ones=6>0, has1=true) -> no force.

        moves=6-6=0? 
        But there is no 0 in the entire set, so we don't need a 0-table.

  Therefore, we are good.

  However, note: the condition for force0 is (total_zeros>0 and not has0). 
      In the example with two "111", total_zeros=0, so we don't force0.

  Therefore, the code is as above.

  But note: the constraints say total length <=500000, and n<=100000. 
      We are doing one pass per table, and within each table we do a count of '0' which is O(length). 
      The total length is 500000, so it's efficient.

  Let me run the provided examples.

  Sample Input #1: 
      4
      11101101 
      00
      10001
      10

      total_contestants = 8+2+5+2 = 17.
      saving0 = max(2,6) + max(2,0) + max(3,2) + max(1,1) = 6+2+3+1 = 12.
      has0: 
          table1: 2>=6? no -> 6>=2? yes -> has1=true, has0? no (for table1) -> but table1 doesn't give has0.
          table2: 2>=0 -> true -> has0=true.
          table3: 3>=2 -> true -> has0=true.
          table4: 1>=1 -> true -> has0=true, and 1>=1 -> has1=true.
      Then no force.

      moves = 17-12=5.

  Sample Input #2: 
      2
      101010
      010101

      saving0 = 3+3=6.
      has0: table1: 3>=3 -> true; table2: 3>=3 -> true.
      has1: true for both.
      Then no force.
      moves=12-6=6.

  Sample Input #3: 
      5
      0000
      11
      0
      00000000
      1

      saving0 = 4+2+1+8+1 = 16.
      has0: true (all tables: first:4>=0, second:0<2 -> not, third:1>=0, fourth:8>=0, fifth:0<1 -> not) -> but at least one has0=true? from first, third, fourth.
      has1: true (from second: 2>=0, and fifth: 1>=0, and also the first:0>=4? no, but we only need one) -> true.
      moves=16-16=0.

  Therefore, we output:

      Sample1: 5
      Sample2: 6
      Sample3: 0

  This matches.

  But what about the example that requires force?

      n=2
      Table1: "1110" -> count0=1, count1=3 -> 
          saving0 += max(1,3)=3.
          has0: 1>=3? false -> remains false? but we then do: 
          has1: 3>=1? true -> so has1=true.
          list_force0.append(3-1=2)

      Table2: "1110" -> same: 
          has0: remains false (because after first we set has0=false, then second: 1>=3? false, so has0 remains false) -> so after both, has0 is false.
          has1: true.
          list_force0.append(2) again.

      total_zeros = 1+1=2>0.
      force0 = (2>0 and not has0) = (true and true) = true.
      Then loss = min(list_force0) = 2.

      saving = 3+3 - 2 = 4.
      moves = 8-4=4.

  So we output 4.

  Therefore, we have the solution.

  However, note: the condition for has0 and has1: we are using OR over all tables. We set:

      has0 = False initially.
      Then for each table, we do: 
          if count0>=count1: has0 = True

      So if at least one table has count0>=count1, then has0 becomes true.

  Similarly for has1.

  This is correct.

  We'll code accordingly.

  But note: the problem constraints: the total length of strings is at most 500000, so we can do the counting.

  We'll implement accordingly.

  However, the problem statement says: the sum of |S_i| <= 500000.

  Therefore, we write:

      n = int(input().strip())
      total_contestants = 0
      saving0 = 0
      has0 = False
      has1 = False
      total_zeros = 0
      total_ones = 0
      list_force0 = [] 
      list_force1 = []

      for i in range(n):
          s = input().strip()
          if s == "":
              continue
          L = len(s)
          total_contestants += L
          count0 = s.count('0')
          count1 = L - count0
          total_zeros += count0
          total_ones += count1
          saving0 += max(count0, count1)

          if count0 >= count1:
              has0 = True
          if count1 >= count0:
              has1 = True

          if count0 < count1:
              list_force0.append(count1 - count0)
          if count1 < count0:
              list_force1.append(count0 - count1)

      if total_zeros > 0 and not has0:
          if list_force0:
              loss0 = min(list_force0)
          else:
              loss0 = 0  # but this should not happen, but to be safe?
              # Actually, if there is no table to force0, then we cannot fix? but we have to, so we set a big number? 
              loss0 = 10**18
          saving0 -= loss0

      if total_ones > 0 and not has1:
          if list_force1:
              loss1 = min(list_force1)
          else:
              loss1 = 10**18
          saving0 -= loss1

      moves = total_contestants - saving0
      print(moves)

  But note: we might need to force both, then we subtract twice? 

  We can do:

      loss = 0
      if total_zeros>0 and not has0:
          if list_force0:
              loss += min(list_force0)
          else:
              loss = 10**18   # or moves will be negative? we take min? but we have to output an integer.
      if total_ones>0 and not has1:
          if list_force1:
              loss += min(list_force1)
          else:
              loss = 10**18

      saving = saving0 - loss
      moves = total_contestants - saving

  But we can combine:

      saving = saving0
      if condition0: saving -= min0
      if condition1: saving -= min1

  Then moves = total_contestants - saving.

  But if we do:

      saving0 is the base saving.
      Then we subtract the loss for force0 and force1.

  That is what we do.

  We'll output the moves.

  However, we must be cautious: if both conditions are true, we subtract two losses.

  But in the example with two tables: 
      Table1: "1110" -> saving0 = 3 (for table1) + 3 (table2) = 6.
      Then we subtract min(list_force0)=2, so saving=6-2=4? 
      Then moves=8-4=4.

  But if we do:

      saving0 = 6
      loss = 2  (from the first condition) 
      saving = 6-2 = 4
      moves = 8-4=4.

  That is correct.

  Therefore, we output the code as described.

  However, note: the sample input #1 and #2 are large? but we already verified.

  We'll run on the sample inputs.

  But the problem says total_contestants can be up to 500000, and n up to 100000, but the sum of lengths is 500000, so n might be up to 100000 but the strings are very short on average.

  We are doing a count of '0' for each string: the total cost is the total length (500000) so it's efficient.

  Let me write the code accordingly.

  But note: we must be careful that the force conditions are checked only if the respective total_zeros or total_ones is positive.

  We are done.

  However, note: the problem says the total_zeros and total_ones we computed as the sum over tables, which is the total zeros and ones in the entire set.

  This is correct.

  Therefore, the final solution is as above.

  We'll output the moves.

  But note: if the computed moves is negative? we take max(0, moves)? but total_contestants>=saving? because saving0 is the sum of max per table, which is at least the size of the table, and then we subtract losses? but losses are nonnegative, so saving <= saving0 <= total_contestants? 

  And moves = total_contestants - saving >=0.

  So it's nonnegative.

  We'll output it.

  Let me run the sample inputs.

  Sample1: 5 -> as above.
  Sample2: 6.
  Sample3: 0.

  And the forced example: 4.

  Therefore, we have the solution.

  However, note: there is a possibility that we set loss=10**18, then moves might be negative? but if there is no table in list_force0 when we need to force0, then we set loss0=10**18, and then moves = total_contestants - (saving0 - 10**18) = a big negative? 

  But we should avoid that: if there is no table to force0, then we cannot force, but the problem: we must assign. 

  But it is guaranteed that there is at least one table? and we have to set it to 0? 

  But the condition: we need to force0 only if there is no table with count0>=count1? and then list_force0 should be nonempty? because every table has count0<count1, so we added an entry for every table.

  Therefore, list_force0 is not empty.

  Similarly for force1.

  So we don't need the else branch? 

  We can remove the else and assume the list is not empty.

  Code:

    n = int(input().strip())
    total_contestants = 0
    saving0 = 0
    has0 = False
    has1 = False
    total_zeros = 0
    total_ones = 0
    list_force0 = [] 
    list_force1 = []

    for i in range(n):
        s = input().strip()
        L = len(s)
        total_contestants += L
        count0 = s.count('0')
        count1 = L - count0
        total_zeros += count0
        total_ones += count1
        saving0 += max(count0, count1)

        if count0 >= count1:
            has0 = True
        if count1 >= count0:
            has1 = True

        if count0 < count1:
            list_force0.append(count1 - count0)
        if count1 < count0:
            list_force1.append(count0 - count1)

    if total_zeros > 0 and not has0:
        # list_force0 should be nonempty
        saving0 -= min(list_force0)
    if total_ones > 0 and not has1:
        saving0 -= min(list_force1)

    moves = total_contestants - saving0
    print(moves)

  We'll test with an example that has no 0: 
        n=1, table: "1" 
        total_zeros=0 -> skip force0.
        has1: count1=1>=count0=0 -> true -> skip force1.
        saving0 = 1, moves=1-1=0.

  But n>=2? the problem says n>=2.

  So we are safe.

  Therefore, the editorial is complete.

  However, note: the sample input #1 has 4 tables, and the example we did for force0 had two tables.

  We'll submit the solution accordingly.

  But note: the constraints on the total length of strings is 500000, and we are counting zeros for each string, which is O(|S_i|), so total O(500000).

  We are also storing the list_force0 and list_force1: the sizes are at most n, which is 100000, which is acceptable.

  We'll run the code for the worst-case: n=100000, and each string of length 5? total length=500000.

  We are good.

  Let me run the provided examples.

  Sample1: 
      n=4, 
      s1: "11101101" -> count0= number of '0's: 
          The string: 11101101 -> 
              1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1 -> two zeros -> count0=2, count1=6.
          max=6.
          has0: 2>=6? false -> then check: 6>=2? true -> so has1=true (and we don't set has0).
          then since 2<6, append to list_force0: 6-2=4.

      s2: "00" -> count0=2, count1=0.
          max=2.
          has0: 2>=0 -> true -> set has0=true.
          has1: 0>=2? false -> skip.
          then 0<2? -> no, and 0<2 is not the condition for list_force1? 
          But for list_force1: condition is count1 < count0 -> 0<2 -> true, so append count0-count1=2-0=2 to list_force1.

      s3: "10001" -> 
          '1', '0','0','0','1' -> count0=3, count1=2.
          max=3.
          has0: 3>=2 -> true.
          has1: 2>=3? false.
          list_force1: 2<3 -> true, append 3-2=1.

      s4: "10" -> 
          count0=1, count1=1.
          max=1.
          has0: 1>=1 -> true.
          has1: 1>=1 -> true.
          no append to list_force0 or list_force1.

      Now: 
          total_zeros = 2+2+3+1 = 8? -> but wait: 
             table1: 2
             table2: 2
             table3: 3
             table4: 1 -> total=2+2+3+1=8.
          total_ones = 6+0+2+1=9? -> total_contestants=8+9=17.

          force0: (total_zeros>0 and not has0) -> has0 is true, so skip.
          force1: (total_ones>0 and not has1) -> has1 is true (because table4 set it), so skip.

          saving0 = 6+2+3+1=12.
          moves=17-12=5.

      Output: 5.

  Therefore, we output 5.

  We are done.

  Note: the sample input #2 and #3 are as above.

  We'll output the code accordingly.

  However, the problem says: the total_zeros and total_ones we computed as the entire count? 
      But in the condition for force0, we use total_zeros>0 (which is the entire count of zeros) and has0 (which is: at least one table has count0>=count1).

  This is the intended logic.

  Therefore, we have a solution that passes the samples.

  We'll write the code accordingly.

  But note: the problem asks for an editorial without code, so we have described the solution.

  The final solution in words:

      Step 1: Read n and the n binary strings.

      Step 2: For each string S_i:
          - Let L = |S_i|, and count the number of '0's (count0) and then count1 = L - count0.
          - Add L to total_contestants.
          - Add max(count0, count1) to saving0.
          - Update:
                has0 = has0 OR (count0>=count1)
                has1 = has1 OR (count1>=count0)
          - If count0 < count1, then append (count1 - count0) to list_force0.
          - If count1 < count0, then append (count0 - count1) to list_force1.
          - Also, add count0 to total_zeros and count1 to total_ones.

      Step 3: 
          - If there is at least one 0 (total_zeros>0) and there is no table that has count0>=count1 (i.e., has0 is false), then we need to force a table to be 0-table. The minimal loss for that is min(list_force0). Subtract that loss from saving0.
          - Similarly, if there is at least one 1 (total_ones>0) and there is no table that has count1>=count0 (has1 is false), then subtract the minimal loss from list_force1.

      Step 4: The minimal moves = total_contestants - saving0.

      Step 5: Output the moves.

  This solves the problem.

  Note: The reasoning is that saving0 is the total saving (number of contestants that are not moved) we get if we set each table to the majority dish (or arbitrarily in tie). Then if we are missing a table for dish 0 (or dish 1), we have to force one table to be set to that dish, which may incur a loss (because we could have set it to the majority dish and saved more) and we choose the table that minimizes the loss.

  The solution is optimal.

  End of editorial.
