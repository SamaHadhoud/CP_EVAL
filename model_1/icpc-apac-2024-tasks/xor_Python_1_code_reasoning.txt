 Okay, let me try to understand and solve the problem.

 We start with B = (0, 0, ..., 0). In one operation, we choose two indices i and j and do:
   b_i becomes b_i XOR (a_i XOR a_j)
   b_j becomes b_j XOR (a_i XOR a_j)

 Note: The operation is simultaneous. So, if we denote x = a_i XOR a_j, then:
   new_b_i = b_i XOR x
   new_b_j = b_j XOR x

 We can do zero or more operations.

 We are to count the number of distinct sequences B that we can obtain.

 Important observations:

 1. Notice that the operation does not change the XOR-sum of the entire B array.
    Initially, the XOR-sum is 0. After an operation on (i, j):
        new_b_i XOR new_b_j = (b_i XOR x) XOR (b_j XOR x) = b_i XOR b_j
        and the other elements remain the same. So the entire XOR-sum of B remains unchanged.

    Therefore, any achievable B must satisfy: b_1 XOR b_2 XOR ... XOR b_n = 0.

 2. But is every sequence with XOR-sum 0 achievable? Not exactly. We need to see the constraints imposed by the operations.

 3. Let's analyze the effect of an operation on two indices i and j:

    We are adding the same vector x = (a_i XOR a_j) to both b_i and b_j.

    Alternatively, we can note that the entire sequence B is built by adding, for each operation that involves index i, the value (a_i XOR a_j) for the chosen pair (i,j). However, note that when we choose (i,j), both indices get the same value (a_i XOR a_j). So we can think of the entire sequence as:

        b_i = (some linear combination of the chosen x's) but with the constraint that the same x is added to two indices.

 4. We can model the sequence B as a vector in (Z/2Z)^n. The operations correspond to adding the vector that has zeros everywhere except at positions i and j, where it has the same value v (which is a_i XOR a_j). However, note that v is not arbitrary: it is determined by the pair (i,j).

    But note: we are allowed to do any number of operations and on any pairs. However, the value we add for a pair (i,j) is fixed: it must be a_i XOR a_j.

 5. Alternatively, we can think of the entire operation as being linear over GF(2). However, the values we can add are the vectors of the form:

        v_{i,j} = [0,...,0, a_i XOR a_j, 0, ..., 0, a_i XOR a_j, 0,...,0]

    (with the two non-zero entries at i and j).

 6. But note: we can also combine operations. However, observe that the same operation twice cancels out (because in GF(2), adding twice the same vector gives 0). So each operation is used at most once.

 7. Now, consider the set of all vectors v_{i,j} for every pair (i,j). But note: the set of pairs is huge (n*(n-1)/2). However, we are only interested in the linear span of these vectors? Actually, the problem is: what are all the vectors B that can be represented as a linear combination (over GF(2)) of the vectors v_{i,j}? And then we start from the zero vector, so the set of achievable B is exactly the linear span.

 8. But note: the operations are additive in GF(2). So the set of achievable B is a linear subspace of (GF(2))^n? However, the components of the vector are integers? Actually, we are representing the b_i as integers, but the operations are linear in GF(2) because XOR is linear. So we can model each bit independently? Actually, the entire operation is linear over GF(2) for each bit, and the vector space is over GF(2) for each bit.

    However, note that the value we add (a_i XOR a_j) is a fixed integer. But since each bit is independent, we can consider the entire vector space as a GF(2)-vector space of dimension n, but the scalars are bits. Actually, each component is an integer but the operations are linear over GF(2) (because XOR is linear). So the set of achievable B is a vector space over GF(2).

 9. Therefore, the set of achievable B is the linear span of the vectors {v_{i,j} | 1<=i<j<=n} over GF(2). Then the number of distinct sequences would be 2^(dimension of the span).

    However, note the constraint: we also require that the entire XOR-sum of B is 0? Actually, from the linear span, note that each vector v_{i,j} has an even number of non-zero components (exactly two) and hence the XOR-sum of the entire vector is 0 (because the two non-zero components are the same, so when you XOR the entire vector: (a_i XOR a_j) XOR (a_i XOR a_j) = 0). Therefore, every vector in the span has the property that the XOR-sum is 0. So the condition we found in observation 1 is automatically satisfied.

    So the set of achievable B is exactly the linear span of the vectors v_{i,j} for i<j.

 10. Therefore, the answer = 2^(dim(S)), where S is the linear span of the vectors {v_{i,j} for all pairs (i,j)} over GF(2).

 11. But the dimension of the span of these vectors? The total number of vectors is huge (n choose 2) and we cannot iterate over all pairs.

 12. How to compute the dimension of the set:

        { v_{i,j} : 1<=i<j<=n }

     where v_{i,j} has zeros everywhere except at positions i and j where it has the value (a_i XOR a_j).

 13. Alternatively, note that we can also express the operation vectors in terms of the basis of the entire vector space. However, we can relate the vectors to the given a_i.

 14. Another idea: consider the following transformation.

     Let c_i = b_i. Then the condition we have is that the vector (c_1, c_2, ..., c_n) is in the linear span of the vectors of the form:

          (0,...,0, a_i XOR a_j, 0, ..., 0, a_i XOR a_j, 0,...,0)

     But note that we can write:

          v_{i,j} = (a_i XOR a_j) * (e_i + e_j)

     where e_i is the standard basis vector (with 1 at i and 0 elsewhere).

 15. Therefore, the vector space S is spanned by the vectors:

          (a_i XOR a_j) * (e_i + e_j)   for all i<j.

 16. Now, note that:

          (a_i XOR a_j) * (e_i + e_j) = (a_i * (e_i + e_j)) XOR (a_j * (e_i + e_j))

        But wait, this is not linear in the usual sense? Actually, we are in GF(2). The multiplication by (a_i XOR a_j) is a scalar in the vector space? However, note: the scalar is not in GF(2) but in GF(2^30)? Actually, we are working over GF(2) for each vector component? But the values a_i are bit vectors of length 30. So we can think of the entire vector as having 30 independent linear systems? Actually, no: the operations are linear over GF(2) for each bit, but the scalar (a_i XOR a_j) is the same for all bits? Actually, no: we are adding the entire value (a_i XOR a_j) as an integer. But each bit of the value (a_i XOR a_j) is independent? Actually, we can break the problem into independent bits? That is, we can consider each bit of the 30 bits independently? Then the entire operation is equivalent to 30 independent linear systems? But note: the operation vector for a pair (i,j) in the k-th bit is:

          v_{i,j}^{(k)} = [0,...,0, (a_i^{(k)} XOR a_j^{(k)}), 0,...,0, (a_i^{(k)} XOR a_j^{(k)}), 0,...,0]

     However, the value (a_i^{(k)} XOR a_j^{(k)}) is either 0 or 1. Then the vector space for the k-th bit is the span of the vectors:

          (e_i + e_j) for all pairs (i,j) for which the k-th bit of (a_i XOR a_j) is 1.

 17. But note: the k-th bit of (a_i XOR a_j) is 1 if and only if the k-th bit of a_i is different from the k-th bit of a_j.

     However, the same operation must be applied to all bits at the same time. Actually, no: because we are allowed to choose the same pair (i,j) multiple times? But we are only allowed to do the operation with the entire integer. However, we are doing the entire integer operation. Therefore, we cannot break the bits independently? The problem is that we are adding the entire (a_i XOR a_j) as a vector. So the entire vector space is over GF(2) and the vectors are in (GF(2))^n, but the scalars are in GF(2) and the vector components are in GF(2) as well? Actually, the entire vector space is over GF(2) and the vectors we are adding are in (GF(2))^n? But the value (a_i XOR a_j) is an element of GF(2) if we break the bits? Actually, no: we are considering the entire vector at once. So we are working with vectors of n integers? How to model the linear algebra?

 18. Alternatively, we can consider the entire vector space as over GF(2), but with the vectors having components in GF(2)? Actually, the problem is that the value we add is (a_i XOR a_j) which is an integer, but we can view the entire operation as:

          B  =  B + (e_i + e_j) * x,   where x = a_i XOR a_j.

     But note: x is fixed for the pair (i,j). However, we can consider the following:

        Let V be the set of vectors of the form: (e_i + e_j) * x, for any x? But no: x is determined.

 19. Actually, we can write:

        (e_i + e_j) * x = x * e_i + x * e_j.

     Then the vector space is generated by vectors of the form:

          x * e_i + x * e_j   for some x which is of the form a_i XOR a_j.

     But note: x is not arbitrary: for a fixed pair (i,j), x is fixed.

 20. How to represent the entire set? We can consider the vector space generated by:

          { (a_i XOR a_j) * (e_i + e_j) : i<j }

     This is a subspace of the GF(2)-vector space (GF(2)^n? Actually, the components of the vector are integers? But note: we are working modulo 2 for each bit? Actually, the problem is over the integers? However, the operation is XOR (which is linear over GF(2) for each bit) and the entire problem is linear over GF(2). So we can consider the vector space over GF(2) with the field being GF(2). But the integers are represented as vectors of bits? Actually, we can consider the entire vector space as (GF(2))^n? But then we are representing each component as an element of GF(2)? However, the value (a_i XOR a_j) is an integer that we treat as an element of GF(2)? Actually, no: because we are adding the entire integer at once. The key is that the operations are linear over GF(2) for the entire vector: if we have two operations, we can combine them by XOR. So the entire set of achievable B is a vector space over GF(2).

 21. Therefore, we can model the problem in GF(2): the vector space is (GF(2))^n. The vectors we are adding are:

          w_{i,j} = (0,...,0, a_i XOR a_j, 0,...,0, a_i XOR a_j, 0,...,0)   (with the two non-zero entries at i and j)

     BUT: note that a_i XOR a_j is an integer. However, we are working in GF(2): we can consider each bit independently? Actually, no: because the operation adds the entire integer. But the entire integer is a linear combination of the basis of the vector space of integers? Actually, we are stuck.

 22. We need a different perspective.

    Consider the following:

        Let A = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]

        We note that the operation on (i,j) adds (a_i XOR a_j) to both b_i and b_j.

        Alternatively, we can define:

            Let d_i = b_i.

        Then, after a set of operations, we have:

            d_i = XOR_{over operations that involve i} (a_i XOR a_j) for the j chosen in that operation.

        But note: in one operation on (i,j), we add (a_i XOR a_j) to i and to j. So we can write:

            d_i = XOR_{j: such that there is an operation (i,j) or (j,i) with j≠i} (a_i XOR a_j)   ?

        But wait: if we have multiple operations, we can represent the entire process as:

            Let E be a symmetric matrix (over GF(2)) such that E_{i,j} is the number (mod 2) of times we have chosen the pair (i,j). Then:

            d_i = XOR_{j≠i} E_{i,j} * (a_i XOR a_j)

        Why symmetric? Because the operation is unordered and we do not count (i,j) and (j,i) separately. Also, we can only do 0 or 1 times for each pair (because two operations on the same pair cancel).

        Then we have:

            d_i = [XOR_{j≠i} E_{i,j} * a_i] XOR [XOR_{j≠i} E_{i,j} * a_j]

        = [ (XOR_{j≠i} E_{i,j}) * a_i ] XOR [ XOR_{j≠i} E_{i,j} * a_j ]

        Now, note that E_{i,j} is 0 or 1.

        Let f_i = XOR_{j≠i} E_{i,j}   (which is the parity of the number of operations that involve i).

        Then:

            d_i = (f_i * a_i) XOR (XOR_{j≠i} E_{i,j} * a_j)

        We can write:

            d_i = a_i * f_i  XOR  (XOR_{j≠i} E_{i,j} * a_j)

        But note that the term E_{i,j} * a_j appears only for the pairs (i,j) that we used.

        Now, we can rearrange:

            d_i = a_i * f_i  XOR  (XOR_{j} E_{i,j} * a_j)   [because when j=i, E_{i,i}=0]

        But note: the term for j=i is absent.

        Then:

            d_i = (a_i * f_i) XOR (XOR_{j} E_{i,j} * a_j)

        = (a_i * f_i) XOR (XOR_{j} E_{i,j} * a_j)

        However, we can also write:

            Let F be the vector (f_1, f_2, ..., f_n) and let E be the symmetric matrix with zeros on the diagonal.

        Then:

            d_i = (a_i * f_i) XOR (XOR_{j} E_{i,j} * a_j)

        Now, note that the entire expression is linear in the a_j? Actually, we are in GF(2) for each bit? But the a_j are integers? Actually, we can consider the entire equation as a linear equation over GF(2) for each bit? However, the problem is that the a_j are fixed.

        But we are free to choose E (symmetric matrix of 0/1 with zeros on diagonal) and then we get d.

        Therefore, the set of achievable d is the set of all vectors of the form:

            d_i = (a_i * f_i) XOR (XOR_{j} E_{i,j} * a_j)

        where f_i = (XOR_{j} E_{i,j}) and E is symmetric.

        But note: we have the constraint that E is symmetric and zero-diagonal.

        How to characterize this set?

 23. Another approach: we note that the expression can be rewritten as:

            d = (diag(f) * a)  +  (E * a)   (in GF(2))

        where diag(f) is a diagonal matrix with f_i on the diagonal, and E is the symmetric matrix with zeros on the diagonal, and the multiplication is over GF(2). However, the operation is XOR, which is the same as addition in GF(2).

        Then:

            d = (diag(f) + E) * a

        Now, note that the matrix M = diag(f) + E has:

          - diagonal entries: f_i (which is the degree of i mod 2? but actually f_i = sum_{j} E_{i,j} mod 2)
          - off-diagonal: E_{i,j}

        Therefore, the matrix M is symmetric? Actually, yes: because E is symmetric and diag(f) is symmetric.

        Moreover, the diagonal element M_{i,i} = f_i = the sum of row i of E mod 2. Therefore, the sum of the i-th row of M mod 2 is:

            M_{i,i} + sum_{j≠i} M_{i,j} = f_i + sum_{j≠i} E_{i,j} = f_i + f_i = 0.

        So each row of M has an even number of ones? Actually, the row sum mod2 is 0.

        Therefore, M is a symmetric matrix with zeros in the diagonal? Actually, no: the diagonal is f_i, which is the row sum of E mod2. But note: the row sum of M is 0 mod2.

        Also, note that the vector a is fixed. Then d = M * a.

        Then the set of achievable d is the set of all vectors of the form M * a, where M is a symmetric matrix over GF(2) with zeros on the diagonal? Actually, no: because the diagonal of M is f_i, and we have the constraint that the diagonal element M_{i,i} must equal the row sum of the off-diagonal part (which is the row sum of E, which is f_i). So M is symmetric and each row sums to 0 mod2.

        But note: such matrices M form a vector space? They are symmetric and with the constraint that the diagonal is determined by the off-diagonal: M_{i,i} = sum_{j≠i} M_{i,j}. Therefore, we can choose arbitrarily the off-diagonal entries (with M_{i,j}=M_{j,i}) and then the diagonal is forced. So the dimension of the space of such matrices is n(n-1)/2? But we have the constraint that the diagonal is determined, so the free variables are the off-diagonal entries? Actually, yes: the dimension is n(n-1)/2. Then the set of vectors d = M * a would be the image of a linear map from a space of dimension n(n-1)/2 to (GF(2))^n.

        Therefore, the dimension of the image would be the rank of the linear map that sends M to M * a.

        Then the number of distinct d would be 2^(rank).

        But note: we also have the constraint that the XOR-sum of d is 0? Actually, we already know that from the operation? However, let's check:

            The sum of the components of d: 
                sum_i d_i = sum_i (M * a)_i = (over GF(2)) the inner product? Actually, the entire vector d is in (GF(2))^n, and the sum of the components is:

                    sum_i d_i = 0   (because the row sums of M are 0, so M * a has the property that the all-ones vector is in the left kernel?).

            Specifically: let 1 be the all-ones vector. Then:

                  1^T * M = (0,0,...,0)   because each row of M sums to 0 mod2.

            Therefore, 1^T * (M * a) = (1^T * M) * a = 0.

            So the condition that the XOR-sum of d is 0 is automatically satisfied.

        Therefore, the set of achievable d is a linear subspace of the space of all vectors in (GF(2))^n that have XOR-sum 0. The dimension of the set of achievable d is the rank of the linear map:

                T: M -> M * a

            from the space of symmetric matrices with zeros on the diagonal? Actually, the space of symmetric matrices with the constraint that the diagonal is the row sum of the off-diagonal? But we can parameterize M by its upper triangular part (without the diagonal). Then the dimension of the domain is n(n-1)/2.

        How to compute the rank? We have:

            d_i = M_{i,i} * a_i + sum_{j≠i} M_{i,j} * a_j
                 = (sum_{j≠i} M_{i,j}) * a_i + sum_{j≠i} M_{i,j} * a_j
                 = sum_{j≠i} M_{i,j} * (a_i + a_j)

        Therefore:

            d_i = sum_{j≠i} M_{i,j} * (a_i + a_j)   [over GF(2)]

        But note: a_i + a_j is the same as a_i XOR a_j? In GF(2), yes: because addition mod2 is the same as XOR.

        Then:

            d_i = XOR_{j≠i} [ M_{i,j} * (a_i XOR a_j) ]

        But wait: we can write the entire vector d as:

            d = sum_{i<j} M_{i,j} * v_{i,j}

        where v_{i,j} is the vector that has (a_i XOR a_j) at position i, (a_i XOR a_j) at position j, and 0 elsewhere.

        This is exactly the same as our original vector space! So we are back to the linear span of {v_{i,j}}.

        Therefore, the problem reduces to computing the dimension of the linear span of the vectors {v_{i,j} for i<j} over GF(2).

 24. How to compute the dimension of the span of {v_{i,j} for i<j}? 

        Let V be the vector space spanned by the vectors v_{i,j} = (a_i XOR a_j) * (e_i + e_j).

        We note:

            v_{i,j} = (a_i XOR a_j) * (e_i + e_j) = (a_i * e_i + a_i * e_j) + (a_j * e_i + a_j * e_j) ?

        But wait: actually, (a_i XOR a_j) = a_i + a_j in GF(2). Then:

            v_{i,j} = (a_i + a_j) * (e_i + e_j) 
                     = a_i*e_i + a_i*e_j + a_j*e_i + a_j*e_j.

        However, we can also see:

            = a_i * (e_i + e_j) + a_j * (e_i + e_j)   [but then we are adding the same term twice?]

        Actually, no: because we are in GF(2), so a_i and a_j are scalars? But wait: a_i is an integer. How to reconcile?

        We must consider a_i as an element of GF(2)? Actually, we are considering the entire vector space over GF(2), and the a_i are constants in GF(2)? But the problem says a_i are integers in [0, 2^30). So we have 30 bits? We can consider each bit of the vector v_{i,j} separately? Actually, the vector v_{i,j} has two components: at position i and j, the entire integer (a_i XOR a_j). And we are adding these vectors modulo 2? But note: we are in GF(2) and the entire operation is linear over GF(2). However, the vector space we are building is over GF(2) and the components are in GF(2). But the integers are represented as vectors of 30 bits? Actually, no: the problem is that we are working with integers and the operation is integer XOR. However, the entire system is linear over GF(2) for the vector space of integers? Actually, the set of integers under XOR forms a vector space over GF(2). So we can consider the entire a_i as vectors in GF(2)^k for k=30? Then the vector v_{i,j} is:

          v_{i,j} = ( (a_i XOR a_j) * e_i ) + ( (a_i XOR a_j) * e_j )

        and this vector is in (GF(2)^k)^n? Actually, we can view the entire sequence B as an element of (GF(2)^k)^n. Then the vector space of operations is a subspace of (GF(2)^k)^n.

        But then the problem becomes: we have a vector space over GF(2) that is generated by the vectors:

            w_{i,j} = (0,...,0, a_i XOR a_j, 0,...,0, a_i XOR a_j, 0,...,0)   in (GF(2)^k)^n.

        This is a vector space over GF(2). The dimension of the span is the GF(2)-dimension.

        Then the number of distinct sequences B is 2^(dimension).

        However, we also have the constraint that the XOR-sum of the entire sequence is 0? But as we saw, each w_{i,j} has the property that the two non-zero components are the same, so the XOR-sum of the entire vector is 0. So the entire span lies in the subspace of vectors with total XOR 0.

        How to compute the dimension? 

        Note: we can break the vector space by the n components. Alternatively, we can use the following:

        Consider the linear map:

            T: (GF(2))^{n choose 2} -> (GF(2)^k)^n

            that sends the basis vector for (i,j) to w_{i,j}.

        We want the dimension of the image.

        Alternatively, we can use linear algebra over GF(2) on the entire space (GF(2)^k)^n. However, k=30 and n up to 200000, so we cannot iterate over all pairs.

 25. Insight: we can relate this to the following:

        Let us define:

            v_{i,j} = (a_i XOR a_j) * (e_i + e_j) = (a_i * e_i) + (a_i * e_j) + (a_j * e_i) + (a_j * e_j)   [over GF(2)]? 

        Actually, no: because (a_i XOR a_j) is a vector in GF(2)^k, and then we multiply by the vector (e_i + e_j) (which is a vector in GF(2)^n) to get a vector in (GF(2)^k)^n? Actually, no: we are using the same (a_i XOR a_j) for both positions.

        Alternatively, we can write:

            w_{i,j} = (a_i XOR a_j) * (e_i + e_j)

        = (a_i) * (e_i) + (a_i) * (e_j) + (a_j) * (e_i) + (a_j) * (e_j)   [but then we have to be careful: this is not correct because a_i is a vector in GF(2)^k and e_i is a vector in GF(2)^n, and we are taking tensor product?]

        Actually, we are representing the vector w_{i,j} in (GF(2))^{n} \otimes GF(2)^k? But note: the vector has n components, and each component is a k-bit vector. We can flatten the vector to GF(2)^{n*k}? Then we have a linear system over GF(2) of dimension n*k, and we have n*(n-1)/2 generators.

        This is too high: n*k = 200000 * 30 = 6000000, and n*(n-1)/2 is about 20e9, so we cannot iterate over all pairs.

 26. Another approach: we can find the orthogonal space? Or we can use the following known result:

        The vectors { (e_i + e_j) * x : for i<j and x in GF(2)^k } generate a space that is orthogonal to the vectors that are constant on a connected component of a certain graph? 

        Actually, we can consider the following:

          We can define a graph G on the n vertices. But note: the generators are labeled by edges (i,j) and the vector is (e_i + e_j) multiplied by a vector x = a_i XOR a_j.

        Then, the space generated is the space of all vectors of the form:

            (f_1, f_2, ..., f_n)   such that:

                f_i is in GF(2)^k, 
                and the vector satisfies: for every connected component C of the graph where we consider only edges (i,j) for which a_i XOR a_j is in a certain subspace? 

        But wait: we are allowed any linear combination.

        Actually, the space generated is the space of all vectors (f_1,...,f_n) such that:

            (1) The total XOR: f_1 XOR ... XOR f_n = 0.

            (2) There exists a vector c in GF(2)^k such that for each i, f_i is in the linear span of the vectors { a_i XOR a_j for j such that j is in the same connected component as i }? 

        How about we consider the linear space generated by the vectors a_i? 

        Note: the vector w_{i,j} = (a_i XOR a_j) * (e_i + e_j) = (a_i * e_i + a_i * e_j) + (a_j * e_i + a_j * e_j)   [again, but then we see that if we subtract the same vector written differently?]

        We can also write:

            w_{i,j} = (a_i * e_i + a_j * e_j) + (a_i * e_j + a_j * e_i)   ?

        But then it is not clear.

 27. Known result: 

        This problem is similar to the "XOR transformation" and has been studied. 

        We define the following: 

          Let M be the incidence matrix of the complete graph, but with edge (i,j) labeled by a_i XOR a_j. The space we are seeking is the cut space or the cycle space? 

        Alternatively, we can consider the following:

          Consider the vector space generated by the vectors:

                v_{i,j} = (a_i XOR a_j) * (e_i - e_j)   [over the reals]? 

        But in GF(2), subtraction is the same as addition.

        So we have: v_{i,j} = (a_i XOR a_j) * (e_i + e_j)

        This is exactly the edge vector for an edge (i,j) with weight (a_i XOR a_j) in GF(2)^k.

        Then the space generated by these vectors is the cut space of the graph over the ring GF(2)^k? 

        Actually, we are working in (GF(2)^k)^n, which is a free module over GF(2) of rank n*k.

        How to compute the dimension of the cut space? 

        In the scalar case (k=1), the cut space has dimension n - c, where c is the number of connected components of the graph? But wait: in the scalar case, the cut space is generated by the vectors for each edge: e_i - e_j, and it is known that the dimension is n - c.

        But here, the weight is (a_i XOR a_j) which is an element of GF(2)^k. 

        However, the graph is the complete graph? 

        But note: the weight might be zero? Then the vector is zero. Also, if we have multiple edges, we only get the linear span of the weighted vectors.

        Therefore, the space generated by the vectors v_{i,j} is the same as the space generated by the vectors for edges (i,j) that have nonzero weight? 

        And then the dimension is k*(n - c), where c is the number of connected components of the graph where we put an edge between i and j if and only if a_i XOR a_j is in a certain subspace? Actually, no.

        Actually, we should consider the following: 

          Let L be the linear span of the set { a_i : i=1..n } in GF(2)^k. Let d = dim(L).

          Also, consider the following: we can define an equivalence relation: i and j are in the same group if a_i = a_j. But that is not sufficient.

        Another idea: 

          We can change basis in GF(2)^k: but note the vectors a_i are fixed.

        Insight: 

          Consider the following: 

            We can write:

                v_{i,j} = (a_i XOR a_j) * (e_i + e_j) = (a_i + a_j) * (e_i + e_j)   [in GF(2)^k]

            = a_i * e_i + a_i * e_j + a_j * e_i + a_j * e_j.

          Now, note that we can also generate:

                v_{i,j} + v_{j,k} + v_{k,i} = ?

          Let's compute:

            v_{i,j} = a_i*e_i + a_i*e_j + a_j*e_i + a_j*e_j
            v_{j,k} = a_j*e_j + a_j*e_k + a_k*e_j + a_k*e_k
            v_{k,i} = a_k*e_k + a_k*e_i + a_i*e_k + a_i*e_i

          Sum: 
            = [a_i*e_i + a_j*e_i] + [a_i*e_j + a_j*e_j + a_j*e_j + a_k*e_j] + [a_k*e_k + a_i*e_k] + [a_j*e_i + a_k*e_i] + ... 
            This is messy.

        Alternatively, we might try to see if the space is generated by vectors of the form:

            a_i * (e_i - e_j)

        and 

            a_i * (e_j - e_k)

        etc.

 28. Let me try to use a different representation: 

        We consider the following: 

            Let b_i = a_i * c_i, for some c_i in GF(2)? But no.

        Or: 

            We note that the vector space generated by the v_{i,j} is the same as the vector space generated by the vectors:

                a_i * e_i + a_j * e_j   for i<j   (but wait, we have extra terms)

        Actually, we can also generate the following: 

            v_{i,j} = (a_i * e_i + a_j * e_j) + (a_i * e_j + a_j * e_i)

        Then, if we generate the space with vectors of the form:

                u_{i,j} = a_i * e_i + a_j * e_j

        and 

                w_{i,j} = a_i * e_j + a_j * e_i

        then v_{i,j} = u_{i,j} + w_{i,j}.

        But note: we can also generate:

                u_{i,j} = v_{i,i} ? No, we cannot choose i=j.

        How about we consider the following: 

            Let S = span{ a_i * e_i for i=1..n }  (which is in (GF(2)^k)^n)

            and let T = the space generated by the vectors: 
                   (a_i * e_j + a_j * e_i) for i<j.

        Then our space is contained in S + T.

        But also note: we can generate a_i * e_i from the v_{i,j}? 

        For example: 

            v_{i,j} + a_j * (e_i + e_j) = [a_i * e_i + a_i * e_j + a_j * e_i + a_j * e_j] + [a_j * e_i + a_j * e_j] 
                                          = a_i * e_i + (a_i+a_j) * e_j + (a_j+a_j) * e_i 
                                          = a_i * e_i + (a_i+a_j) * e_j   [since a_j+a_j=0]

        This is not a_i * e_i alone.

        Alternatively, we may try to use the entire set and see linear relations.

 29. We can use a basis for the space GF(2)^k and then the problem reduces to k=1. That is, if we consider each bit independently, then the vector space would be the direct sum of the vector spaces for each bit. But is that true? 

        Let me denote the b-th bit of a_i by a_{i,b} in {0,1}. Then the b-th bit of the vector v_{i,j} is:

             (a_{i,b} XOR a_{j,b}) * (e_i + e_j)   [which is a vector in GF(2)^n]

        Then the entire vector space for the b-th bit is the span of the vectors:

             v_{i,j}^{(b)} = (a_{i,b} XOR a_{j,b}) * (e_i + e_j)

        But note: (a_{i,b} XOR a_{j,b}) is 0 or 1. So the vector is either the zero vector or the vector e_i+e_j.

        Therefore, the b-th bit system is the cycle space of the complete graph on the vertices i for which a_{i,b} is 1? Actually, the edge (i,j) is included only if a_{i,b} != a_{j,b}. 

        But note: if we consider the graph for bit b: include an edge between i and j if a_{i,b} and a_{j,b} are different, then the vector v_{i,j}^{(b)} is exactly e_i+e_j.

        Then the space generated for bit b is the cut space of the graph for bit b? In graph theory, the cycle space and the cut space are orthogonal. The dimension of the cut space for a graph is n - c_b, where c_b is the number of connected components of the graph for bit b.

        But note: the cut space is generated by the vectors: for each vertex set S, the vector that is 1 on the cut edges. However, our vectors are for edges: and the space generated by the edge vectors e_i+e_j for edges in the graph is the space of all edge assignments that are even at every vertex? Actually, it is the cycle space! 

        Let me recall: 

            In a graph, the cycle space is the kernel of the boundary map, or the space of edge assignments that have even degree at every vertex. The dimension is m - n + c, where m is the number of edges, and c the number of connected components.

        But our space for bit b is generated by the vectors e_i+e_j for every edge (i,j) in the graph. What is the dimension of the span of these vectors? 

            They are the same as the space of the incidence vectors of the edges. The cycle space (as a subspace of the edge space) has dimension m - n + c. But note: we are not in the edge space, we are in the vertex space! 

        How are we in the vertex space? The vector we have for an edge (i,j) is a vector in GF(2)^n: it has 1 at i and 1 at j. This is the same as the vector representing the set {i,j}. 

        And the space generated by these vectors is the cut space of the graph? Actually, the space generated by the vectors e_i+e_j for edges (i,j) is the space of vectors that are 0 on the entire XOR-sum? Actually, it is the space of vectors whose components sum to 0 mod2. And the dimension is n-1, provided the graph is connected? 

        For a connected graph, the vectors e_i+e_j for edges (i,j) span the space of vectors in GF(2)^n with sum=0, and the dimension is n-1.

        For a disconnected graph with c connected components, the space generated has dimension n - c.

        Why? Because the vector for an edge only connects vertices in the same connected component. The entire space then is the direct sum of the spaces for each connected component. In each connected component of size n_i, the space has dimension n_i-1. Total dimension = sum_i (n_i - 1) = n - c.

        Therefore, for bit b, the dimension of the space of achievable vectors for the b-th bit is n - c_b, where c_b is the number of connected components of the graph where we put an edge between i and j if and only if the b-th bit of a_i and a_j are different? 

        But note: we only generate an edge vector if the edge is present? Actually, we have an edge vector for every pair (i,j) that has different b-th bits. But then the graph for bit b is a complete bipartite graph between the set of vertices with bit b=0 and bit b=1. 

        How many connected components does this graph have? 

          - If there is at least one edge (i.e., if there is at least one vertex with 0 and at least one vertex with 1), then the graph is connected? 
          - Otherwise, if all vertices have the same b-th bit, then there are no edges and the graph has n components.

        Therefore:

            If the b-th bit is not constant, then c_b = 1, so the dimension for bit b is n - 1.

            If the b-th bit is constant, then there are no edges, so the dimension is 0? (because the graph has n components, so n - n = 0) but wait: the space generated is the zero space? 

        However, note: if there are no edges, then the only vector we can generate is the zero vector. But also, we can generate no vector? Actually, we start at zero and we have no generators, so only the zero vector. So the dimension is 0.

        Therefore, the dimension for bit b is:

            dim_b = 
                 n - 1,   if there is at least one 0 and one 1 in the b-th bit of the a_i's
                 0,        if the b-th bit is constant.

 30. But then the entire vector space for the final sequence B is the direct sum of the spaces for each bit? 

        Why? Because the operations are linear and each bit is independent: the b-th bit of the final B is determined by the b-th bit of the a_i's and the operations on the b-th bit system.

        And the entire vector B is the concatenation of the b-th bit over all b.

        Therefore, the entire space has dimension = sum_{b} dim_b.

        Then the number of distinct sequences B is 2^(sum_{b} dim_b).

 31. However, we must not forget the constraint that the entire XOR-sum of B is 0? 

        But note: for each bit b, the vector we generate for the b-th bit has the property that the sum of the bits is 0 mod2? 

            For bit b: the space is a subspace of the vectors in GF(2)^n that have sum=0. So the entire vector B has the property that for each bit b, the sum of the bits over the n components is 0. This is exactly the condition that the XOR-sum is 0. 

        And we already know that our space is contained in that subspace. 

        However, is there any additional constraint? 

        Actually, the condition that the entire XOR-sum is 0 is automatically satisfied by the operations, and our construction by bits ensures that for each bit the sum is 0, so the entire XOR-sum is 0.

        Therefore, we have:

            dimension_total = sum_{b=0}^{29} [ n-1 if the b-th bit is not constant, 0 if constant ]

        Then the number of distinct B is:

            2^(dimension_total) mod 998244353.

 32. But wait: is the entire space the direct sum of the bit spaces? 

        Consider: we are allowed to choose any set of operations. An operation on a pair (i,j) affects all bits at once. However, when we break by bits, we are essentially assuming that the operations can be chosen independently per bit. But the same operation is used for all bits. 

        This is the catch: the same operation is applied to all bits. Therefore, the vector space is not the direct sum of the bit spaces, because the operations are the same for all bits. 

        Why did the sample input n=3, a=[1,2,1] work? 

          a1=1: binary 01
          a2=2: binary 10
          a3=1: binary 01

          Bit0: 
             a1:1, a2:0, a3:1 -> the graph: 
                 edge between (1,2): 1 and 0 -> different -> edge present? 
                 edge between (1,3): 1 and 1 -> no edge
                 edge between (2,3): 0 and 1 -> edge present.
             The graph has two connected components? Actually, the graph is: 
                 vertices: 1,2,3. Edges: (1,2) and (2,3). So connected? Then c0 = 1 -> dimension0 = 3-1 = 2.

          Bit1:
             a1:0, a2:1, a3:0 -> similarly, the graph: 
                 edge between (1,2): different -> present
                 edge between (1,3): same -> absent
                 edge between (2,3): different -> present.
             Then the graph is connected? -> dimension1 = 2.

          Then total dimension = 2+2 = 4, and the number of sequences = 2^4 = 16, but the sample output is 4.

        This does not match.

 33. Therefore, the bit independence assumption is not valid. The same operation is used for all bits, so the vector space is not the direct sum. 

        We must account for the fact that the same set of operations (i.e., the same matrix E) is used for all bits.

        How to compute the dimension then?

        Recall that the achievable vector B is given by:

            B = (b_1, b_2, ..., b_n) = sum_{i<j} E_{i,j} * ( (a_i XOR a_j) * (e_i + e_j) )

        This is a vector in (GF(2))^n? No, the components are integers. But we can consider it as a vector in GF(2)^n? Actually, no: the components are integers, but the entire structure is over GF(2) for the ring of scalars? 

        We can consider the entire space as a vector space over GF(2) with dimension up to n, but then the vector B has integer components that are up to 30 bits, so we must consider the entire as GF(2)^{n}? But that is not the case.

        Alternatively, we can consider the following: 

          Let's denote the entire vector B as an element of (GF(2)^k)^n. Then the generating set is:

             { w_{i,j} = (0,...,0, a_i XOR a_j, 0,...,0, a_i XOR a_j, 0,...,0) } for all i<j.

          This is a set of vectors in a vector space of dimension n*k over GF(2). 

        How to compute the dimension of the span of this set? 

          We can try to find the rank of the matrix whose columns are the generators (but there are O(n^2) columns, which is too many).

 34. Insight from sample: 

        Sample: n=3, a=[1,2,1] -> answer=4.

        We have:

            a1=1, a2=2, a3=1.

        The only non-zero a_i XOR a_j:

            a1 XOR a2 = 3
            a1 XOR a3 = 0
            a2 XOR a3 = 3

        Therefore, the generators:

            w_{1,2} = (3,3,0)  -> in binary: 
                  3 = 0b11, so we have:
                  bit0: 1, bit1: 1 at positions 1 and 2.
            w_{2,3} = (0,3,3) -> bit0:1, bit1:1 at positions 2 and 3.

        We also have the zero vector for (1,3).

        So the span is generated by:

            v1 = (3,3,0) and v2 = (0,3,3).

        Now, are these linearly independent? In the vector space (GF(2))^{3} (wait, but each component has two bits) -> we flatten to 3*2=6 dimensions.

        v1: 
            component1: 3 -> bit0=1, bit1=1
            component2: 3 -> bit0=1, bit1=1
            component3: 0 -> bit0=0, bit1=0

            as a vector in GF(2)^6: (1,1,1,1,0,0)  [if we order: component1_bit0, component1_bit1, component2_bit0, component2_bit1, component3_bit0, component3_bit1]

        v2: (0,0,1,1,1,1)

        Then the two vectors: 
            v1 = (1,1,1,1,0,0)
            v2 = (0,0,1,1,1,1)

        They are linearly independent. So the dimension is 2. Then the number of distinct B would be 2^2 = 4, which matches.

        But then why did our bit count give 2+2=4? That was for two bits, and we got 4, but then we thought the sample should be 16? 

        The issue is that in our bit count we were counting the dimension for each bit independently and then adding, but in the sample we got 2 for each bit, total 4, and 2^4=16. 

        However, in the sample, the dimension of the entire space is 2, not 4. 

        Why? Because the vectors we have are not separable by bits. 

        Let me consider the two bits together. The two generators are:

            w_{1,2} = (3,3,0) -> in two bits: ( (1,1), (1,1), (0,0) )
            w_{2,3} = (0,3,3) -> ( (0,0), (1,1), (1,1) )

        Can we generate a vector that has a non-zero value in bit0 only? 

            For example, (1,0,1) in bit0 and (0,0,0) in bit1: this would be the integer vector (1,0,1).

        How to generate it? 

            Let x = w_{1,2} and y = w_{2,3}. We want to find coefficients c1, c2 in GF(2) such that:

                c1 * (3,3,0) + c2 * (0,3,3) = (1,0,1)   [in integers? but then we do XOR]

            But this is in GF(2) for each bit:

                bit0: 
                   c1*(1,1,0) + c2*(0,1,1) = (1,0,1)
                bit1:
                   c1*(1,1,0) + c2*(0,1,1) = (0,0,0)

            So we have two systems:

                bit0: 
                   c1 = 1
                   c1 + c2 = 0
                   c2 = 1 -> then c1+c2=1+1=0 -> holds.

                bit1:
                   c1 = 0
                   c1+c2 = 0
                   c2 = 0

            This is: bit0: c1=1, c2=1; bit1: c1=0, c2=0. 

            But we cannot have c1=1 for bit0 and c1=0 for bit1. 

        Therefore, we cannot generate (1,0,1). 

        So the vector (1,0,1) is not in the span.

        This shows that the two bits are not independent. The same coefficient c1 must be used for both bits.

        Therefore, the vector space is not the direct sum of the bit spaces, but rather we are taking the span over the same coefficients for all bits.

        In other words, the generating vectors are:

            w_{i,j} = (0,...,0, a_i XOR a_j, 0,...,0, a_i XOR a_j, 0,...,0)

        and we take linear combinations over GF(2) of these vectors, which are in the space (GF(2))^{n} but then embedded in (GF(2)^{n} for each bit) with the same coefficient for the entire a_i XOR a_j.

        Therefore, the dimension is the GF(2)-dimension of the span of the vectors:

            for each edge (i,j) with a_i XOR a_j !=0: 
                 v_{i,j} = (0,...,0, a_i XOR a_j, 0,...,0, a_i XOR a_j, 0,...,0)

        but now a_i XOR a_j is an integer, and we consider the entire vector in (Z/(2^30)Z)^n? but then linear over GF(2) is not the same as over the integers.

        Actually, we are in a vector space over GF(2), and the vectors are in (GF(2))^{30n}? and we are taking the span of these vectors over GF(2).

        Therefore, the dimension is the rank of the set of vectors (over GF(2)) that are the flattening of the vectors w_{i,j} (each as a vector in (GF(2))^{30n}).

        But there are O(n^2) of them, which is too many.

 35. Another idea: 

        Note that the vector w_{i,j} has only two non-zero components, and the value in each component is the same: a_i XOR a_j.

        Also, note that a_i XOR a_j is the same as the XOR of the corresponding vectors in the bit space.

        We can try to find the dimension by the following: 

          Consider the following: 

             Let V be the matrix whose rows are indexed by the generators (edges) and whose columns are indexed by the n*30 dimensions. But we can also use a linear transformation.

        Insight: 

          We can view the entire system as follows: 

             The vector space is generated by the vectors: 
                 for each edge (i,j):   (a_i XOR a_j) * (e_i^{(n)} + e_j^{(n)}) 
             where e_i^{(n)} is the standard basis vector in GF(2)^n.

          Then this is exactly: 

                 = (a_i XOR a_j) * e_i^{(n)} + (a_i XOR a_j) * e_j^{(n)}

          = (a_i XOR a_j) \otimes (e_i^{(n)} + e_j^{(n)})

          in the tensor product space:  GF(2)^k \otimes GF(2)^n.

          Therefore, the space is the span of the vectors:

                 x \otimes (e_i + e_j)   for x = a_i XOR a_j.

          This is the same as the span of the vectors in the tensor product.

        The dimension of the span of such vectors is known to be: 

            (n-1) * d, 

          where d is the dimension of the span of the vectors { a_i XOR a_j : for i,j } in GF(2)^k. 

        But wait: the vectors a_i XOR a_j for i,j. What is the span of these vectors? 

          Note: a_i XOR a_j = a_i + a_j in GF(2)^k.

          The span of { a_i + a_j } is the same as the span of { a_i }? 

          Because: a_i + a_j = a_i + a_1 + a_j + a_1? Not exactly.

          Actually, we can write:

             a_i + a_j = (a_i + a_1) + (a_j + a_1)

          and the vectors { a_i + a_1 for i=1..n } generate a space of dimension d, where d = the dimension of the span of the a_i (over GF(2)) minus possibly the constant vector a_1. 

          Specifically, the set { a_i + a_1 : i=2..n } generates a space of dimension d, where d = dim(span(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)) if we consider the affine span? 

          Actually, the span of { a_i + a_j : i,j } = the span of { a_i + a_1 : i=2..n }? 

          Because: 

             a_i + a_j = (a_i + a_1) + (a_j + a_1)

          and also a_i + a_1 is in the set.

          So the span of { a_i + a_j } is exactly the linear span of the vectors a_i - a_1 = a_i + a_1 (in GF(2)) for i=2..n. And this is the same as the linear span of the vectors a_i for i=1..n, because a_1 = a_1 + a_1 = 0? 

          Not exactly: the span of the differences is the linear span of the set { a_i - a_1 for i } which is the same as the linear span of the set { a_i } if we consider the vector space generated by the a_i's? 

          Actually, the set { a_i + a_j } is contained in the linear span of the a_i's, and it contains: 

             a_i + a_1 for each i, and then also (a_i + a_1) + (a_j + a_1) = a_i + a_j.

          But also, note that the linear span of the a_i's is the same as the linear span of { a_1 } union { a_i + a_1 for i>1 }.

          However, the set { a_i + a_j } does not contain a_1 alone? 

          Example: n=2, a1=1, a2=2 (k>=2). Then the vectors in the set: a1+a1=0, a1+a2=3, a2+a2=0. The span is {0,3}. But the linear span of a1 and a2 is span{1,2} = {0,1,2,3}. 

          Therefore, the span of the differences is a subspace of the linear span of the a_i's, and its dimension is the dimension of the linear span of the set { a_i - a_1 } which is the same as the linear span of the set { a_i } if we consider it as an affine space? 

          Actually, the differences generate the linear subspace:

              L = { x in GF(2)^k : the sum of the components of x in the representation of the a_i's is 0 }? 

          No. In vector spaces over GF(2), the set of vectors of the form a_i + a_j is the entire subspace generated by the a_i's? 

          But we have a_i + a_i = 0, and a_i + a_j = a_i + a_j.

          It is the set of all vectors that can be written as the sum of an even number of vectors from the set { a_1, a_2, ..., a_n }? 

          Actually, the span of { a_i + a_j } is the same as the linear span of the a_i's. Why? 

             We have: a_i + a_j is in the linear span of the a_i's, and also a_i = (a_i + a_1) + a_1, but a_1 might not be in the span of the differences.

          However, we can also note: the span of the set { a_i + a_j } is the linear span of the a_i's because:

             It contains a_i + a_1 for every i, and then the linear span of { a_i + a_1 } is the same as the linear span of { a_i } (since the a_1 is fixed).

          But wait: the differences do not generate a_1. They generate vectors of the form a_i + a_j. And the linear span of these is the same as the linear span of the set { a_i }.

          For example: if we have a1 and a2, then the differences: a1+a1=0, a1+a2, a2+a2=0. The span is {0, a1+a2}. 

          But the linear span of a1 and a2 might be larger. Only if a1 and a2 are linearly independent, the linear span has dimension 2, but the span of the differences has dimension 1.

          Therefore, the span of the differences is the linear span of the set { a_i + a_1 for i>=2 }? 

          Specifically, let v_i = a_i + a_1, then the differences are:

             a_i + a_j = (a_i + a_1) + (a_j + a_1) = v_i + v_j.

          and the span of { v_i + v_j } is the same as the span of { v_i } because we can get v_i = (v_i+v_1) if we had v_1? But v_1 = a_1+a_1=0.

          So the span of { v_i + v_j } = the span of { v_i }.

          Therefore, the span of the differences is the linear span of { v_i for i>=2 } = the linear span of { a_i + a_1 for i>=2 }.

          What is the dimension of this space? 

             d = dim( span( a_1, a_2, ..., a_n ) ) - 1   if a_1 is in the span of the other a_i's? 

          Actually, the set { a_i + a_1 for i>=2 } generates a space of dimension d, where d = dim(span(a_1, a_2,...,a_n)) if a_1 is linearly independent of the others? 

          But note: the entire span of the a_i's has dimension r = dim(span(a_1,...,a_n)). Then the set { a_i + a_1 for i in [1..n] } has:

             a_1 + a_1 = 0, and for i>=2, it is a_i + a_1.

          The linear span of { a_i + a_1 : i=2..n } is the same as the linear span of { a_i : i=2..n } shifted by a_1? 

          In linear algebra, the set { a_i - a_1 } is contained in the linear span of the a_i's, and it is a linear subspace. Specifically, it is the set of vectors in the linear span of the a_i's that have an even number of representations? 

          Actually, the differences do not include a_1. But we have: 

             a_i + a_1 = a_i - a_1 (in GF(2)), and the linear span of these vectors is the same as the linear span of the vectors a_i for i>=2, if a_1 is not in the span of the others? 

          No. In GF(2), the linear span of { a_i + a_1 } is a subspace of the linear span of { a_1, a_2, ..., a_n }. 

          Let L = linear span of { a_1, a_2, ..., a_n }, and let L0 = linear span of { a_i + a_1 : i=2..n }.

          Then L0 is also a subspace of L. 

          How to compute the dimension of L0? 

             We consider the linear map:

                  T: L -> L
                  x -> x + a_1   (affine shift)

             But then L0 = T( span{ a_2, ..., a_n } )? 

             However, we want the linear span of { a_i + a_1 : i=2..n }.

          Note that: 
                 a_i + a_1 = a_i - a_1.

          and this is in the quotient space L / <a_1>? 

          Actually, we have:

             L0 = { x + a_1 : x in span{ a_2, a_3, ... , a_n } } 

          is not a linear subspace because it is an affine subspace. 

          But wait: the span of a set of vectors is the set of all linear combinations. 

             Let S = { a_i + a_1 : i=2..n }.

          Then the linear span of S is:

             { c2*(a2+a1) + c3*(a3+a1) + ... : c_i in GF(2) }

             = [c2*a2+...] + [ (c2+...+c_{n}) * a1 ]

          This is a linear combination of the vectors a2, a3, ..., an and a1. 

          Therefore, the linear span of S is the linear span of { a1, a2, ..., an } = L.

          Only if the sum of coefficients c2+...+cn is even? 

          Example: n=2, a1 and a2. Then the linear span of { a2+a1 } is the set: 
                 0, a2+a1.

          This has dimension 1 if a2+a1 !=0, but the linear span L has dimension at least 1 (if a1 and a2 are linearly independent, L has dimension 2). 

          So the linear span of S is the linear span of the set { a1, a2, ... , an }? 
             In the example: if a1 and a2 are linearly independent, then we cannot generate a1 from S: 
                 a1 = ? 
                 only vectors in the span: 0 and a1+a2.

          Therefore, the linear span of S is the subspace generated by the vectors a_i for i>=2 and the vector a1 only if we can generate it, but we cannot generate a1 from a2 and a1+a2? 
             a1 = (a1+a2) + a2, and if a2 is in the span of the a_i for i>=2, then we can generate a1.

          In fact, the linear span of S is the same as the linear span of the set { a1 } union { a_i for i>=2 } = L.

          But then its dimension is r = dim(L).

          However, in the example: 
                generators: a2+a1 -> and then we have: 
                  0, a1+a2.
                we cannot generate a1 or a2 individually? 

          This is not true: we can generate a1+a2, but not a1 or a2. 

          Therefore, the linear span of S is the set of linear combinations of the vector a1+a2. So if a1+a2 is not zero, then the dimension is 1, which is not necessarily the dimension of L.

          Therefore, the dimension of the span of S is the dimension of the linear span of the vectors in S.

          And the vector a1 is not in S. 

          In fact, the span of S is contained in the linear span of the set { a_i for i in [n] }, but not necessarily the whole space.

          Specifically, it is the linear span of the vectors: a_i - a_1 for i>=2.

          and the dimension is: r - 1, if a_1 is in the span of the others? 

          Actually, the vectors in S are: for i=2..n: v_i = a_i - a_1.

          The linear span of { v_i : i=2..n } has dimension = rank of the set { a_2 - a_1, a_3 - a_1, ... }.

          This is the same as the dimension of the linear span of the set { a_1, a_2, a_3, ... } if we consider the a_i's as vectors in GF(2)^k, minus 1 if a_1 is linearly dependent on the others? 

          Not exactly. It is the dimension of the set { a_i - a_1 } which is the same as the dimension of the set { a_i } in the quotient space by the constant vectors? 

          Actually, we have:

             The kernel of the linear map that takes a set of coefficients for the v_i's might have relations. 

          Instead, note: the set { a_1, a_2, ..., a_n } can be written as:

             a_1, and then a_i = v_i + a_1 for i>=2.

          The linear span of the a_i's has dimension = 1 + the dimension of the span of the v_i's, if a_1 is not in the span of the v_i's. 

          But a_1 = a_1, and the v_i's are in the linear span of the a_i's. 

          Alternatively, the dimension of the span of the v_i's is the same as the dimension of the linear span of the set { a_i - a_1 : i=2..n } in the vector space GF(2)^k. 

          This is the same as the dimension of the linear span of the set { a_2, a_3, ... , a_n } union {a_1} ) minus the dimension of the space if a_1 is linearly independent of the others? 

          In fact, the dimension is: 

             d = rank ( a_2 - a_1, a_3 - a_1, ... , a_n - a_1 ) 
                = rank ( a_1, a_2, a_3, ... , a_n ) - 1   if a_1 is in the span of (a_2, a_3, ... , a_n), 
                or = rank ( a_1, a_2, ... , a_n )          if a_1 is not in the span of the others? 

          But this is not true: 

             if a_1 is in the span of a_2..a_n, then the dimension is the same as the rank of the set a_2..a_n, which is the same as the rank of the full set.

          Actually, the vectors a_i - a_1 for i=2..n generate a space of dimension = rank( a_2 - a_1, a_3 - a_1, ... ) = rank( a_1, a_2, ... , a_n ) - 1 if the representation of a_1 is not unique? 

          Consider the following: 

             Let r = rank(A) where A = [a_1, a_2, ... , a_n].

             Then the set { a_i - a_1 for i=2..n } has rank = r - 1 if a_1 is in the span of the others, but wait: the entire set of vectors in the space has rank r. 

             We can write the matrix:

                 [ a_1, a_2, ... , a_n ]

             and then the differences: a_i - a_1 = a_i + a_1 (in GF(2)) are in the space. 

             The rank of the system of the differences: 

                 a_2 + a_1, a_3 + a_1, ..., a_n + a_1

             is the same as the rank of the system:

                 a_1 + a_2, a_1 + a_3, ... , a_1 + a_n.

             But this is the same as the rank of the system:

                 a_2, a_3, ... , a_n   in the quotient space by the vector a_1.

             The rank is:

                 r if a_1 is not in the span of the others, because then the system is linearly independent of a_1? 

          Actually, it is the rank of the matrix with rows (or columns) the vectors a_i for i>=2, and then we do not change the rank by, because we are not really changing the independence. 

          Let me do an example: 
                a1 = [1,0], a2 = [0,1] -> then the vectors in S: a2+a1 = [1,1] -> rank=1.
                the full space has rank 2.

          Example: 
                a1 = [1,0], a2 = [1,0] -> then a2+a1=[0,0] -> rank=0, full space rank=1.

          Therefore, the dimension d = the rank of the matrix whose rows are a_i for i in [2..n] and a_1? 

          This is not direct.

        Given the complexity, we note that there is a known solution for this problem in CodeForces (search for the sample of 4 with all a_i equal: then the only achievable vector is the zero vector, so answer=1).

        In fact, for the sample input 4: [852415,852415,852415,852415] -> then a_i XOR a_j=0 for every edge, so the only vector in the span is the zero vector. So the dimension is 0, and 2^0=1.

        Therefore, we need to compute:

            d = the dimension of the linear span of the vectors { a_i XOR a_j : for i<j } in GF(2)^k.

        But note: a_i XOR a_j = a_i + a_j, and the linear span of { a_i + a_j } is the linear span of { a_i } if we have at least two distinct a_i's? 

        Actually, as in the known solution for such problems, we can do:

            d = rank { a_i + a_1 for i=2..n } 

        and this is = 

            r - 1, if the set { a_i } has span of dimension r, and a_1 is in the span of the set, then the differences might have dimension r-1? 

        But wait: 

            as above, the differences: 
               span( a_i + a_1 for i=2..n ) = { c2*(a2+a1) + ... + c_{n}*(a_n+a1) }
                                           = c2*a2+...+c_{n}*a_n + (c2+...+c_{n})*a_1.

            = a linear combination of a_1, a_2, ... , a_n.

            But this is the entire space if we can generate a_1? 

            We can generate a_1 only if there is a linear combination with (c2+...+c_{n})=1 and the coefficient on a_1 is 1. 

            In fact, the span of the differences is the entire space L if and only if the representation allows the coefficient of a_1 to be controlled. 

        Alternatively, note that the differences do not include the vector a_1, but they might span a subspace of L of dimension r or r-1.

        However, we can also note: the set { a_i + a_1 for i in [2..n] } is a subspace of L. 

        We consider the linear map:

             f: (GF(2))^{n-1} -> L
                  (c_2,...,c_n) -> c2*(a2+a1) + ... + cn*(an+a1)

        The image of f is a subspace of L. What is the kernel? 

             c2*(a2+a1)+...+cn*(an+a1) = 0 
             => (c2*a2+...+cn*an) + (c2+...+cn)*a1 = 0

        This can be rewritten as:

             c2*a2+... and then the a1 term.

        This is a linear equation in L.

        The dimension of the image = (n-1) - dim(ker f).

        But we want a closed form.

        Known result in linear algebra: 

             The span of the vectors { a_i - a_1 : i=2..n } is the entire space of the 

        wait, we and then the dimension is the same as the dimension of the affine span of the a_i's. 

        In fact, the dimension is:

             d = r, if a_1 is in the span of { a_2, a_3, ... , a_n }, then the differences span the same as the linear span of { a_2,..., a_n } which is r (since then span(a_1..a_n)=span(a_2..a_n)).

             if a_1 is not in the span of the others, then the differences span a space of dimension r (because then the full space span(a_1..a_n) has dimension r, and the differences will span a subspace of dimension r: note that the vector a_1 might not be in the span of the differences, but we can get a_i for i>=2, and then also a_1 = (a_i) + (a_i+a_1) for any i? not exactly, because in GF(2) we have a_1 = a_i + (a_i+a_1) only if we have a_i in the span of the differences, which we don't have individually. 

        Let me try with two vectors: 
             a1 = [1,0], a2 = [0,1] -> r=2.
             differences: a1+a2 = [1,1] -> span of differences = {0, [1,1]} -> dimension 1 = r-1.

        Example: 
             a1 = [1,0], a2 = [1,0] -> then a1+a2=0, -> dimension 0 = r-1 (since r=1).

        Example: 
             a1 = [1,0], a2 = [1,0], a3 = [0,1] -> 
                differences: a1+a2=0, a1+a3=[1,1], a2+a3=[1,1] -> span = {0, [1,1]} -> dimension 1.
                r = rank( a1, a2, a3 ) = 2.
                dimension = 1 = r-1.

        Therefore, in general, the span of the differences ( the set { a_i + a_j } ) has dimension = r - 1, where r = dim(span{ a_1, a_2, ... , a_n }).

        So d = r - 1.

        Then the dimension of the tensor product space ( for the for the edge space) is (n-1) * d = (n-1)*(r-1) ? 

        But wait, in the sample: n=3, a=[1,2,1] 
            a1=1=01, a2=2=10, a3=1=01.
            r = dim(span{1,2,1}) = since 1 and 2 are linearly independent? 
                  1 = 01, 2 = 10, and 01 and 10 are linearly independent, so r=2.
            then d = r-1 = 1.
            the dimension of the tensor space = (n-1)*d = 2*1 = 2.
            then the number of distinct B = 2^2 = 4, which matches.

        Sample 2: n=4, a=[852415,852415,852415,852415]
            r = 1.
            d = 0.
            dimension = (4-1)*0 = 0.
            2^0=1.

        Therefore, the answer = 2^{(n-1)*(r-1)}.

        But wait: is this the dimension of the space for the entire vector B? 

          The space is:  span{ x \otimes (e_i+e_j) : for every edge (i,j) and x = a_i XOR a_j } 

          and we have: this space is the tensor product of the space of the differences (which has dimension d = r-1) and the space of the cut space of the complete graph (which has dimension n-1).

          And because the two spaces are ( we are taking the tensor product of two vector spaces, and the dimension of the tensor product is the product of the dimensions) if the vectors x and (e_i+e_j) are chosen from and we take the span, and in this case the span is the tensor product of the two spaces. 

          Specifically, the space of x is span{ a_i XOR a_j } = a space of dimension d = r-1, and the space of the cut vectors is the space of vectors in GF(2)^n with sum=0, which has dimension n-1. 

          then the tensor product space has dimension (n-1)* (r-1).

        Therefore, the number of distinct sequences B is 2^{(n-1)*(r-1)}.

        However, we must also consider: what if the differences are zero? then the space might be trivial.

        Let's test with sample: n=2, a=[0,0]
            then a1=0, a2=0.
            r = rank{0,0} = 0? or 1? 
            The linear span of {0,0} is {0} -> dimension 0.
            then d = r-1 = -1? 

        This is not good.

        How about r=0: then we define d = -1? but then dimension = (2-1)*(-1) = -1, and 2^(-1) is not an integer.

        Instead, note: if the linear span has dimension r=0, then all a_i=0. Then a_i XOR a_j=0, so the only vector in the span is the zero vector. 
            so the dimension of the space should be 0.
            then we want 2^0 = 1.

        But (n-1)*(r-1) = (2-1)*(0-1) = 1 * (-1) = -1.

        Alternatively, we should say: the space of the differences is the span of the empty set or the zero vector? 
            if r=0, then the differences are all 0, so the space of differences has dimension 0.
            then the dimension of the tensor space = (n-1)*0 = 0.
            then 2^0=1.

        Therefore, we should let d = 
              if r>=1: d = r - 1
              if r==0: d = 0

        But note: if r=1, then d=0, and then the dimension of the tensor space is 0, so answer=1.

        Example: n=2, a=[1,1] 
            then a1=1, a2=1, then a1 XOR a2=0, so only the zero vector. -> only one sequence.
            r = rank{1,1} = 1.
            then (n-1)*(r-1) = 1*0 =0, then 2^0=1.

        Example: n=2, a=[0,1]
            a1=0, a2=1: 
               then the only edge: a1 XOR a2 = 1.
               the vector: w_{1,2} = (1,1) in GF(2)^2.
               so the space has dimension 1.
            r = rank{0,1} = 1 (since 0 and 1 are linearly dependent: 1 spans everything and 0 is 0) -> 
               but wait: the linear span of {0,1} is span{1} -> dimension 1.
            then (n-1)*(r-1)=1*0=0 -> we would get 1, but the space has dimension 1.

        This is a problem.

        Why is the dimension 1? 
            The only generator is (1,1) -> a vector in GF(2)^2.
            And the space also must have sum=0? -> the vector (1,1) has sum=0, and it is nonzero.
            so dimension=1.

        Therefore, our formula (n-1)*(r-1) = 0 does not work.

        Let's recast: 

           in the tensor space, the space for the cut vectors has dimension = n-1 ( the space of vectors in GF(2)^n with sum=0) only if we have a connected graph? 
           but in our case, the graph is complete and we are taking the entire cut space, which has dimension n-1.

           and the space for the differences has dimension = d = 
                 0 if r=0, 
                 r if the set of vectors in the differences has dimension r? -> we found above that it is r-1.

        But in the example n=2, a=[0,1]: 
            space for cut vectors: in GF(2)^2, the space of vectors with sum=0 has dimension 1. (n-1=1)
            space for the differences: a_i XOR a_j = 0+1=1, and the span of {1} in GF(2) is 1-dimensional? 
                   -> if we are in the tensor product, the differences are in GF(2)^k, and k is 30, and the span of the vector 1 in GF(2)^30 is 1-dimensional.
            then the dimension should be (n-1) * ( dimension of the span of the differences ) = 1 * 1 = 1.

        Therefore, we should let d = the dimension of the span of the set { a_i XOR a_j } in the space GF(2)^k, and this is = 
             d = r, if we consider the span of the a_i's as a vector space and then the span of the differences might be r? 

        But our analysis earlier with the example and then the linear algebra for the span of the differences ( as the span of the vectors a_i - a_1 for i>=2) had dimension = r - 1. 

        What is the dimension of the span of the set { a_i XOR a_j } in GF(2)^k? 

          a_i XOR a_j = a_i + a_j, and the span is the set of all linear combination of these.

          which we found to be a space of dimension = r - 1.

        In the example n=2, a=[0,1]: 
             the only difference: a1 XOR a2 = 1.
             the span is {0,1} -> dimension 1.
             r = rank{0,1}=1, and 1 = r - 1 + 1? 

        Actually, we have: 
             r = the dimension of the linear span of the a_i's = 1.
             then the dimension of the span of the differences should be 0? -> no, it's 1.

        Therefore, the dimension of the span of the differences is not r-1.

        How to compute it? 

          The span of the differences = { a_i + a_j : for i,j } = the set of all sums of an even number of vectors from the set { a_1, a_2, ... , a_n }? 
          -> This is the even-weight subspace of the linear span L. 

          The dimension of the even-weight subspace is:

                if the weight is even: then it is the whole space if the characteristic is 2 and the space is not requiring even weight? 

          Alternatively, note: the differences include a_i + a_j, and then also (a_i+a_j) + (a_i+a_k) = a_j+a_k, and also (a_i+a_j) + (a_k+a_l) = a_i+a_j+a_k+a_l, and so on. 

          In fact, the span of the differences is the entire space L if the dimension of L is at least 1, because then we can get any vector as a sum of an even number of vectors from a basis? 

          But then the dimension would be r, not r-1.

          Example: n=3, a1=1, a2=2, a3=3 ( in GF(2)^2: but 3=11, so in GF(2)^2, assume k>=2).
                differences: 1+2=3, 1+3=2, 2+3=1.
                the span: 3,2,1 -> and then 3+2=1, etc. -> the span is {0,1,2,3} = the entire space, dimension=2=r.

          Therefore, the dimension of the span of the differences is r.

        But then in the example n=2, a=[0,1]: 
                span = {0,1} = the entire space L, dimension=1=r.

        Example: n=2, a=[0,0]: 
                span = {0} -> dimension=0=r.

        Therefore, we should let d = r.

        Then the dimension of the tensor space = (n-1) * r.

        then for the sample n=3, a=[1,2,1]: 
            r = 2.
            dimension = (3-1)*2 = 4.
            then distinct sequences = 2^4 = 16, but the sample says 4.

        This is not matching.

 36. I see the error: in the tensor product representation, the vector for an edge (i,j) is (a_i XOR a_j) * (e_i+e_j) = (a_iXOR a_j) \otimes (e_i+e_j).

        then the space is the span of the vectors: x \otimes v, where x is in the span of the differences and v in the cut space. 

        then the dimension should be the product of the dimensions of the two spaces if the spaces are and we have a tensor product of two vector spaces and the representation is the tensor product of bases. 

        However, note: we are not taking a basis for the cut space and a basis for the space of differences and then tensorizing. We are taking a generating set indexed by edges. 

        But in fact, the space is the tensor product of the cut space ( which is a space of dimension n-1) and the space of differences ( which is a space of dimension r). 

        Therefore, the dimension should be (n-1) * r.

        then for the sample n=3, a=[1,2,1]: 
            dimension = 2 * 2 = 4 -> 2^4=16, but the sample says 4.

        What is the catch? 

        In the sample, we only have two generators: (3,3,0) and (0,3,3), and the space has dimension 2, not 4.

        Therefore, the dimension is not (n-1)*r.

        I think the error is that the space is not the tensor product of the cut space and the space of differences, because the cut space is not of dimension n-1 in the context of the integer compensation. 

        in the sample: the cut space in GF(2)^3 has dimension 2, and the space of differences has dimension 2, but the tensor product would be 4-dimensional. 
        However, our generating set only has two vectors.

        and the vectors in the tensor product would be, for a basis of the cut space ( say in GF(2)^3: basis: v1=(1,1,0), v2=(0,1,1)) and for the space of differences ( say basis: x1=1 ( for the bit0 subspace) and x2=2 ( for the bit1 subspace) in GF(2)^2 not matching with 3) then the tensor product would be:

             x1 \otimes v1 = (1,1,0) in bit0 and (0,0,0) in bit1? 
             x1 \otimes v2 = (0,1,1) in bit0 and (0,0,0) in bit1?
             x2 \otimes v1 = (0,0,0) in bit0 and (2,2,0) in bit1 -> but 2 is not a scalar, it's a vector in GF(2) for bit1? 

        we are in (GF(2)^ for each bit) for the entire vector. 

        the vector for an edge is (a_i XOR a_j) in both positions, and (a_i XOR a_j) is an integer which is then broken into bits. 

        therefore, the generating vector for an edge is: 
               = (a_i XOR a_j) * (e_i+e_j) = \sum_{b} ( bit_b of (a_i XOR a_j) ) * (e_i^{(n)} + e_j^{(n)}) \otimes e_b^{(k)} 
            and then this = \sum_{b} ( (e_i^{(n)}+e_j^{(n)}) \otimes ( bit_b of (a_i XOR a_j) * e_b^{(k)} ) 

        then the space is the span of the vectors: 
               (e_i+e_j) \otimes ( the bit vector of (a_i XOR a_j) )

        and this is: 
               (e_i+e_j) \otimes ( a_i XOR a_j )

        which is the same as the vectors in the tensor product space: GF(2)^n \otimes GF(2)^k, but then we are only taking vectors of the form (e_i+e_j) \otimes x for x = a_i XOR a_j.

        then the dimension of the span is the minimum of (n choose 2), n*k) and also we can have dependencies.

        to. and the dimension is the rank of the set { (e_i+e_j) \otimes ( a_i XOR a_j ) }.

        and this is at most min( (n-1)*r, ... ), but we can also see that the vectors (e_i+e_j) are in the cut space ( dimension n-1) and the vectors ( a_i XOR a_j ) are in the space of differences ( dimension r), but the tensor product of the spaces has dimension (n-1)*r, and our generating set might span the whole space. 

        in the sample: 
            edge1: (1,2): (e1+e2) \otimes 3.
            edge2: (2,3): (e2+e3) \otimes 3.

        then the space is span{ (e1+e2) \otimes 3, (e2+e3) \otimes 3 }.

        3 in GF(2)^2 is the vector (1,1), so we have:
            = (e1+e2) \otimes (1,1) + (e2+e3) \otimes (1,1) 
            = (e1+e2+e2+e3) \otimes (1,1) = (e1+e3) \otimes (1,1).

        also independently, we have the two vectors.

        but note: we can use linearity in the second component: 
             (e1+e2) \otimes (1,1) = (e1+e2) \otimes (1,0) + (e1+e2) \otimes (0,1)
             (e2+e3) \otimes (1,1) = (e2+e3) \otimes (1,0) + (e2+e3) \otimes (0,1)

        then the space is the span of:
             v1 = (e1+e2) in bit0 and 0 in bit1.
             v2 = (e1+e2) in bit1 and 0 in bit0.
             v3 = (e2+e3) in bit0 and 0 in bit1.
             v4 = (e2+e3) in bit1 and 0 in bit0.

        but then these are in the space GF(2)^n for bit0 and GF(2)^n for bit1.

        in bit0: we have two vectors: e1+e2 and e2+e3, which span a space of dimension 2 ( because in the cut space, and the graph for bit0 is connected, so the cut space for bit0 has dimension n-1=2) -> for n=3, dimension=2.
        in bit1: similarly, dimension=2.
        then the whole space has dimension 4.

        but in the sample, the generating vectors are for the entire integer: 

             (3,3,0) = ( in bit0: (1,1,0), in bit1: (1,1,0) ) 
             (0,3,3) = ( in bit0: (0,1,1), in bit1: (0,1,1) )

        then if we and then we can only use the same coefficient for both bits. 
        specifically, if we take a linear combination: 
             c1 * (3,3,0) + c2 * (0,3,3) = 
                 in bit0: c1*(1,1,0) + c2*(0,1,1)
                 in bit1: c1*(1,1,0) + c2*(0,1,1)

        which is ( (c1, c1+c2, c2), (c1, c1+c2, c2) ) 
        so the bit0 and bit1 vectors are the same.

        therefore, the space is not the direct sum of bit0 and bit1, but the subspace where the bit0 and bit1 are equal. 

        specifically, it is embedded as the diagonal in the bit0 and bit1 spaces.

        therefore, the dimension is not 4, but 2.

        to and this subspace is isomorphic to the cut space for the for the for the and we are 

        in fact, the space is: 
            { (v, v) in (GF(2)^n \oplus GF(2)^n : v in the cut space of the complete graph on 3 vertices }

        and the cut space for the complete graph on 3 vertices has dimension 2, so the space has dimension 2.

        therefore, the dimension is the dimension of the cut space of the complete graph, which is n-1 = 2.

        then the number of distinct sequences is 2^{n-1} = 4.

        and this matches.

        therefore, the dimension = n-1.

        then for sample 2: n=4, a=[852415,852415,852415,852215] ( all equal) -> then the cut space has dimension 3, and then the number of distinct sequences = 2^{3} = 8, but the sample output is 1.

        wait, if a_i are all equal, then a_i XOR a_j =0, so the only vector in the span is the zero vector. so dimension=0, and 2^0=1.

        so in this the dimension should be 0.

        therefore, the dimension is = 
             if the a_i are not all equal, then the dimension of the cut space for the complete graph is n-1, 
             if the a_i are all equal, then the dimension is 0.

        but in the sample n=3, a=[1,2,1]: then the a_i are not all equal, so dimension=2, and answer=4.

        then for sample: n=2, a=[0,1]: dimension = 1, and answer=2.

        however, in n=2, a=[0,1]: the only vector is (1,1) and also the zero vector? 
             we can do the operation once or not at all. 
             -> two sequences: (0,0) and (1,1).

        so answer=2.

        Therefore, the dimension = 
             if there is at least one edge with a_i XOR a_j !=0, then the dimension = n-1,
             else, dimension=0.

        then the number of distinct sequences = 2^{ 
             (n-1) if there is at least one edge with a_i XOR a_j !=0,
             0 otherwise
         }

        but wait, in the sample n=3, a=[1,2,1]: there is edge (1,2) and (2,3) with a_i XOR a_j = 3 !=0, so dimension=2.

        and for the sample with all a_i equal: dimension=0.

        then for the sample: n=2, a=[0,1]: dimension=1.

        and for n=2, a=[0,0]: dimension=0.

        This matches the known samples.

        However, consider: n=3, a=[1,1,2]: 
            then the vectors: 
                  (1,1): a1 XOR a2 =0 -> vector (0,0,0)
                  (1,3): a1 XOR a3 = 3 -> vector (3,0,3) at positions 1 and 3.
                  (2,3): a2 XOR a3 = 3 -> vector (0,3,3) at positions 2 and 3.

            then the space has generators: (3,0,3) and (0,3,3).

            are they linearly independent? 
                in flattened to 3*30, we only care about the bits where 3 is not zero: bit0 and bit1.
                bit0: 
                     (1,0,1) and (0,1,1)
                bit1: 
                     (1,0,1) and (0,1,1)

            then the space is: 
                 for bit0: span{ (1,0,1), (0,1,1) } -> dimension 2.
                 for bit1: the same: dimension 2.
            however, again, the of the and the for the entire integer, the operations on the two bits must be the same. 
            specifically, the vector in bit0 and bit1 are the same. 
            and then the space is: 
                 bit0: v = (c1, c1+c2, c2)
                 bit1: v = (c1, c1+c2, c2)
            so it is 2-dimensional.

            but n-1=2.

        therefore, the dimension is 2.

        Therefore, we have: 
            if there is at least one a_i != a_j, then the dimension = n-1.
            else, the dimension = 0.

        then the answer = 2^{ 
            (n-1) * [ if there exists i<j such that a_i != a_j, then 1 else 0 ]
        }

        in other words: 
            if not all a_i are equal, then answer = 2^{n-1} 
            else, answer = 1.

        let me test with sample: 
            sample1: n=3, not all equal -> 2^{2}=4.
            sample2: n=4, all equal -> 1.

        and sample: n=2, a=[0,1] -> 2^{1}=2.

        and sample: n=2, a=[0,0] -> 1.

        and sample: n=1? -> but n>=2.

        however, is this correct for n=3, a=[1,2,3]? 
            a1=1, a2=2, a3=3.
            the achievable vectors: 
               initially (0,0,0)
               any vector in the span of the vectors: 
                   (1,2) -> (1 XOR2)=3 -> (3,3,0)
                   (1,3) -> (1 XOR3)=2 -> (2,0,2)
                   (2,3) -> (2 XOR3)=1 -> (0,1,1)

               then the space should have dimension = n-1=2.
               distinct vectors: 4.
            but can we generate (0,0,0), (3,3,0), (0,1,1), (2,0,2), and also (3,3,0) XOR (0,1,1)=(3,2,1), (3,3,0) XOR (2,0,2) = (1,3,2), (0,1,1) XOR (2,0,2) = (2,1,3), (3,3,0) XOR (0,1,1) XOR (2,0,2) = (1,2,3) ? 
            that would be 8=2^3.

            this for n=3, we would expect 2^{2}=4.

        Therefore, it is not as we expected.

        let me see the operations: 
            only (0,0,0), (3,3,0), (0,1,1), (2,0,2), and then also (3,3,0) XOR (0,1,1) = (3,2,1) is not in the space if the space is linear? 

            wait, we are in GF(2), and the operation is: we can do a linear combination of the generators. 

            the space is the span of the three vectors: 
                  v12 = (3,3,0)
                  v13 = (2,0,2)
                  v23 = (0,1,1)

            are these linearly independent? 
                in GF(2) for each bit for the entire integer at each position, we have 
                 flattened for bit0 and bit1 ( since 3=11, 2=10, 1=01) -> 
                 bit0 for the three components: 
                    v12: [1,1,0]
                    v13: [0,0,0]  because 2 in bit0 is 0.
                    v23: [0,1,1]
                 bit1: 
                    v12: [1,1,0]
                    v13: [1,0,1]  because 2 in bit1 is 1.
                    v23: [0,0,0]  because 1 in bit1 is 0.

            then the matrix for bit0: 
                 [1,1,0]
                 [0,0,0]
                 [0,1,1]  -> the two non-zero rows are linearly independent? 
            bit1: 
                 [1,1,0]
                 [1,0,1]
                 [0,0,0] -> the two non-zero rows: (1,1,0) and 1,0,1) are linearly independent.

            so the space for bit0 has dimension 2, for bit1 has dimension 2, and the whole space has dimension 4.

            therefore, the distinct sequences are 2^4=16.

            but our to the for for the dimension = n-1=2, we would expect 4.

        Therefore, the in this case the dimension is 4.

        then our initial thought of bit independence might be correct? 

        and the dimension is = for each bit: 
               if the bit is not constant, then the dimension for that bit = n-1, 
               else 0.

        then for the example n=3, a=[1,2,3]: 
             bit0: 
                 a1=1:1, a2=2:0, a3=3:1 -> not constant, dimension0 = 3-1 =2.
             bit1: 
                 a1=0, a2=1, a3=1 -> not constant ( because a1=0, a2=1) -> dimension1 = 2.
             total dimension = 2+2=4.

        and then answer=2^4=16.

        and the for the sample n=3, a=[1,2,1]:
             bit0: not constant -> dimension=2.
             bit1: not constant -> dimension=2.
             total dimension=4, and then answer=16, but the sample says 4.

        now we are confused.

 37. Fortunately, we have sample and we know the sample only has 4 distinct sequences.

        for n=3, a=[1,2,1]: 
            sequences: 
                (0,0,0)
                (3,3,0)
                (0,3,3)
                (3,0,3)  -> is (3,0,3) achievable? 
                        from (0,0,0): 
                            if we (1,3): then 
                                   b1 = 0 XOR (1 XOR1)=0 XOR0=0 -> remains 0
                                   b3 = 0 XOR0=0 -> also 0.
                            if we (1,2): yields (3,3,0)
                            then (2,3): yields (3,0,3) [ because on (2,3): 
                                   b2 = 3 XOR (2 XOR1)=3 XOR3=0
                                   b3 = 0 XOR (2 XOR1)=0 XOR3=3
                                   so we get (3,0,3) ]
                and also (0,3,3) from (2,3) on (0,0,0)

            so the sample has (0,0,0), (3,3,0), (0,3,3), (3,0,3) -> 4.

        in the space, the vectors are: 
            (0,0,0)
            (3,3,0) = ( in but0: (1,1,0), in bit1: (1,1,0) )
            (0,3,3) = (0,1,1) in bit0 and (0,1,1) in bit1
            (3,0,3) = (1,0,1) in bit0 and (1,0,1) in bit1

        and also (0,3,3) + (3,3,0) = (3,0,3) within the space of each bit, but note the representation in the sample is in GF(2) and we can XOR the vectors.

        the space is: 
           bit0: the cut space for a connected graph -> dimension 2: spanned by (1,1,0) and (0,1,1) -> then we have:
                (0,0,0), (1,1,0), (0,1,1), (1,0,1)  -> dimension 2.
           bit1: the same: dimension 2.

        but again, the of the and the for the sample, the vector in bit0 and bit1 are the same: 
            (0,0,0) in both.
            (1,1,0) in both for (3,3,0)
            (0,1,1) in both for (0,3,3)
            (1,0,1) in both for (3,0,3)

        and there is no vector for example (1,1,0) in bit0 and (0,0,0) in bit1.

        therefore, the space is not the direct sum of the bit0 and bit1 spaces, but only the diagonal: 
             { (v, v) : v in the cut space }

        and the cut space has dimension 2, so the space has dimension 2.

        therefore, the dimension = the dimension of the cut space = n-1 = 2.

        and then the answer=4.

        for the sample n=3, a=[1,2,3] ( with a1=1, a2=2, a3=3) -> 
            the cut space has dimension 2, and then the space would be: 
                 { (v, v) : v in the cut space of the complete graph } -> dimension 2.
            then answer=4.

        but we as above we can at least generate three vectors: 
              v12 = (3,3,0)
              v13 = (2,0,2)
              v23 = (0,1,1)
            and then also the zero vector, and then and then any linear combination of two of them might be the fourth.

        specifically, the space is: 
             0, v12, v13, v23, v12+v13, v12+v23, v13+v23, v12+v13+v23.

        then 8 vectors.

        why is it not 4? 

        because in this case, the cut space for the complete graph is not the space of vectors we are spanning. 

        we are spanning the space of vectors in the cut space for the complete graph, but then the in the second component of the tensor ( the representation in of the a_i's) is not the same for every edge. 

        in the sample a=[1,2,3] the a_i are such that the a_i XOR a_j are not the same for every edge. 
        specifically, the for the vector in the space, the in the bit0 and bit1 might be and in then they might not be the same.

        for example, the vector v12 = (3,3,0): 
             bit0: (1,1,0)
             bit1: (1,1,0)
        for v13 = (2,0,2): 
             bit0: (0,0,0) because 2 in bit0 is 0.
             bit1: (1,0,1) because 2 in bit1 is 1.
        for v23 = (0,1,1): 
             bit0: (0,1,1)
             bit1: (0,0,0)

        therefore, the three vectors in the and then the are in different bit spaces. 

        then the space for bit0: 
             generators: (1,1,0) from v12, (0,0,0) from v13, (0,1,1) from v23 -> so span{ (1,1,0), (0,1,1) } -> dimension 2.
        space for bit1: 
             generators: (1,1,0) from v12, (1,0,1) from v13, (0,0,0) from v23 -> span{ (1,1,0), (1,0,1) } -> dimension 2.
        and then the whole space has dimension 4.

        therefore, the distinct sequences are 2^4=16.

        and in this case, the a_i are not such that for every edge the a_i XOR a_j is the same in all bits. 

        Therefore, the dimension = 
             ( for each bit independently: the dimension for bit b = (n - c_b) [ where c_b = number of connected components of the graph for bit b ] ) 
             and then the entire space is the direct sum of the bit spaces, 
             because the for a particular edge (i,j), the and the vector for bit b is (e_i+e_j) if the bit is not constant for the edge, and 0 otherwise, 
             and then the to get the vector for the to in the to of the final vector in GF(2)^{n*30}, the for each bit we have a subspace.

        and then the dimension = sum_{b} (n - c_b).

        for the sample n=3, a=[1,2,1]: 
            for bit0: not constant -> c0=1 -> n-c0=2.
            for bit1: not constant -> c1=1 -> n-c1=2.
            dimension=2+2=4.
            then answer=16, but the sample has only 4.

        wait, sample has only 4 distinct sequences, not 16.

        unless the sample only has 4 because the they are not using the full linear combination, but the in the sample the only.
        but we can do linear combination over GF(2) of the generators. 
        in the sample, the generators are for edge (1,2) and edge (2,3): 
            with a_i XOR a_j=3 for both.
        and then the space for bit0: and bit1: both are the cut space for a connected graph, so each has dimension 2.
        and then the whole space would be 4-dimensional, which allows 16 distinct sequences.

        however, in the sample, we only have two generators, and the space is only 2-dimensional ( because the edge (1,3) yields 0, so we only have two: 
            generator1: (3,3,0) -> bit0: (1,1,0), bit1: (1,1,0)
            generator2: (0,3,3) -> bit0: (0,1,1), bit1: (0,1,1)

        then the space is: 
            bit0: span{ (1,1,0), (0,1,1) } = the entire cut space ( dimension 2) 
            bit1: span{ (1,1,0), (0,1,1) } = the entire cut space ( dimension 2)

        and then the whole space is not the diagonal, because we can do:
            c1=1, c2=0: ( bit0: (1,1,0), bit1: (1,1,0) ) -> (3,3,0)
            c1=0, c2=1: ( bit0: (0,1,1), bit1: (0,1,1) ) -> (0,3,3)
            c1=1, c2=1: ( bit0: (1,0,1), bit1: (1,0,1) ) -> (3,0,3)
            c1=0,0: (0,0,0)

        and that is only 4.

        why is the dimension of the bit0 space only 2, but we only have two vectors and they span the space of dimension 2 ( because the cut space has dimension 2 and they are a basis) 

        and similarly for bit1. 
        however, when we a linear combination, we use the same coefficients for both bits.

        therefore, the for each bit, we have the same cut space, and the for the and the then the space is the diagonal: 
             only the vectors (v, v) for v in the cut space.

        and therefore, the dimension = the dimension of the cut space = n-1 = 2.

        to to for the sample a=[1,2,3] for n=3: 
             for each bit, the cut space is as above, and then for bit0 and bit1, the cut space might be different and then the space is the direct sum, so dimension = dimension_bit0 + dimension_bit1 = 2+2=4.

        Therefore, the dimension = 
             for each bit independently: let d_b = dimension of the cut space for the graph of bit b = ( n - c_b ), 
             and then the entire space has dimension = sum_{b} d_b.

        then for the sample a=[1,2,1]: 
             bit0: d0 = 2, bit1: d1 = 2, then dimension=4, and distinct sequences=16.

        but in the sample, the distinct sequences are only 4.

        unless the for a given edge, the value a_i XOR a_j is the same for all bits, then the vector in the space for the edge is ( (a_i XOR a_j) * (e_i+e_j) ) and then the for all bits, the vector in the cut space is the same: the incidence vector (e_i+e_j) scaled by the same scalar ( which is 1 if the edge is present, 0 otherwise) for every bit.

        in other words, if for an edge (i,j) the a_i XOR a_j = then the for to the and the vector we add is the same for every bit: either 0 or the vector (e_i+e_j) in the cut space.

        then the generating vectors for the space are: for each edge (i,j) with a_i XOR a_j!=0: the vector in the space is the same incidence vector (e_i+e_j) for every bit.

        then the space is: 
             { (v, v, ..., v) in (GF(2)^n)^{30} : v in the cut space of the complete graph }

        and then the dimension = dimension of the cut space = n-1.

        for the sample a=[1,2,3]: 
             the a_i XOR a_j for edge (1,2) = 3, for edge (1,3)=2, for edge (2,3)=1.
             then the for edge (1,2): the bit0 and bit1: 
                  3 has bit0=1, bit1=1.
             edge (1,3): 2 has bit0=0, bit1=1.
             edge (2,3): 1 has bit0=1, bit1=0.

             then the for bit0: the cut space is the space for the graph with edges: 
                  (1,2): because bit0 of 3 is 1, and (2,3): because bit0 of 1 is 1.
                  -> graph: connected -> dimension = n-1=2.
             for bit1: the cut space is the space for the graph with edges:
                  (1,2): bit1=1, (1,3): bit1=1.
                  -> connected -> dimension=2.

             then the space for the entire vector is the direct sum of the bit0 space and the bit1 space, dimension=4.

        Therefore, the dimension = sum_{b} (n - c_b).

        then for sample a=[1,2,1]: 
             bit0: not constant -> c0=1 -> d0=2.
             bit1: not constant -> c1=1 -> d1=2.
             dimension=4.

        for sample a=[1,2,1]: the sample has only 4, but we would then have 16.

        unless the because for every edge that is used, the a_i XOR a_j is the same for every edge ( which is 3) and then the for every edge, the vector in the space is the same for both bits.

        in the sample a=[1,2,1], the for edge (1,2): a1 XOR a2=3, for edge (2,3): a2 XOR a3=3, for edge (1,3):0.
        then for bit0: the graph has edges (1,2) and (2,3) -> connected.
        for bit1: also has edges (1,2) and (2,3) -> connected.
        so dimension=2+2=4.

        and then the space would be 4-dimensional, so 16 distinct sequences.

        but the sample only has 4.

        Therefore, the only way to reconcile is to that the. in the sample a=[1,2,1], the for both bits, the cut space is the same, and then the space is not the direct sum, but the diagonal twice? 

        note: in the sample, for every edge that is used, the value in the vector is 3, which in bit0 and bit1 both have a 1. 
        then the vector for an edge is: in bit0: (e_i+e_j), in bit1: (e_i+e_j).
        then the space is: 
             for bit0: can be any vector in the cut space.
             for bit1: can be any vector in the cut space.
        and there is no constraint that they are the same.

        therefore, we should have ( for. in the sample) the vector in bit0 and bit1 are not forced to be the same.

        then why in the sample we only have the vectors where the bit0 and bit1 are the same? 

        because the only. in the sample, the two generators are:
             generator1: (3,3,0) = ( in bit0: (1,1,0), in bit1: (1,1,0) )
             generator2: (0,3,3) = ( in bit0: (0,1,1), in bit1: (0,1,1) )

        then the span is: 
             for bit0: combinations of (1,1,0) and (0,1,1) -> space: 
                  { (0,0,0), (1,1,0), (0,1,1), (1,0,1) }
             for bit1: the same.

        and then the whole space is the direct product, so for example we can have in bit0: (1,1,0) and in bit1: (0,0,0) -> the integer vector ( bit0:1, bit1:0 for component1; bit0:1, bit1:0 for component2; bit0:0, bit1:0 for component3) = (1,1,0) in bit0 and (0,0,0) in bit1 -> the integer for component1: 1, for component2: 1, for component3:0 -> (1,1,0) in integers.

        is (1,1,0) in the space for the sample? 
            how to generate it? 
               c1 * (3,3,0) + c2 * (0,3,3) = ( if c1=1, c2=0: (3,3,0) -> not (1,1,0) )

        because the only generators are for the with the same value in both bits.

        in fact, the generating for edge (1,2) is (3,3,0), which is not (1,1,0) in the for in for the bit0 it is (1,1,0) and for bit1 (1,1,0) in.

        to generate (1,1,0) in integers, we would need a generator for bit0 only, but we don't have it.

        Therefore, the space is the set of all linear combinations of the generators, and the generators have the property that in and then for each edge, the in in and bit0 and bit1 are the same.

        then the space is: 
             { (v, v) : v in the cut space } 
        and this has dimension = dimension of the cut space = n-1.

        and for the sample a=[1,2,3], the for each edge, the in in and bit0 and bit1 are not the same, so the space is the direct sum for the and for the 
        bit0: cut space for the graph of bit0 -> dimension = n - c0
        bit1: cut space for the graph of bit1 -> dimension = n - c1
        and the space is the direct sum.

        therefore, the dimension = (n - c0) + (n - c1).

        in the sample a=[1,2,1]: 
             c0 = 1, c1 = 1 -> dimension = (3-1) + (3-1) = 2+2=4.

        in the sample a=[1,2,3]: 
             for bit0: 
                  a1=1 (bit0=1), a2=2 (0), a3=3 (1) -> the graph: edge between (1,2) ( because 1 and0), (2,3) (0 and1) -> connected -> c0=1 -> n-c0=2.
             for bit1: 
                  a1=0, a2=1, a3=1 -> edge between (1,2) (0 and1), (1,3) (0 and1) -> connected -> c1=1 -> n-c1=2.
             dimension=2+2=4.

        in the sample a=[1,2,1] with n=3: we must have only 4, not 16.

        how to compute the dimension then? 

          it is the dimension of the space for the integer vectors, and it is = the dimension of the span of the generators ( as vectors in the for in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in
