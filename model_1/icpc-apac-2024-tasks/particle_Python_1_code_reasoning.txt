 Okay, let's break down the solution:

 Steps:
 1. Precompute the counts of 'A' and 'P' in S and E.
 2. Set up the equations:
      A_i + 2*x - a * rA = A_g   => 2*x - a * rA = A_g - A_i
      P_i + 2*y - p * rP = P_g   => 2*y - p * rP = P_g - P_i

 3. We need to find non-negative integers (x, y, rA, rP) that satisfy the above.

 However, note that the equations are independent? Actually, they are independent in counts. But note: the operations also change the positions and the structure of the string. The feasibility condition is necessary but not sufficient? However, the problem says that if such integers exist then there is a way? Actually, the problem states: "It can be shown that there’s always a sequence of operations satisfying this bound for k if the initial state can be transformed into the goal state at all." and also we are to output -1 if no solution exists.

 But note: the counts condition is necessary. However, there might be structural constraints (like the pattern of the string). However, the problem does not specify that the counts condition is sufficient. But the editorial and the sample solutions use the counts condition to decide feasibility.

 However, after checking the sample: 
   Sample 2: AAAAAAA (7A) to PPPPPPP (7P): 
        Equation for A: 7 + 2*x - 10 * rA = 0 -> 2*x - 10*rA = -7 -> which has no nonnegative solution (because left side is even? but -7 is odd). So we output -1.

 But what about the possibility of having the same counts but the string structure is not achievable? The editorial says: "If no solution exists, output -1", meaning no solution to the linear equations.

 However, there might be cases where the linear equations have solutions but the string cannot be transformed? But the problem states: "It can be shown that there’s always a sequence of operations satisfying this bound for k if the initial state can be transformed into the goal state at all." and the counts condition is necessary. Also, the constraints are small (|S|,|E|<=50). Therefore, we assume that the counts condition is sufficient? Actually, the sample cases and the problem structure suggest that we can always expand and then remove to achieve the goal.

 But note: the problem does not guarantee that the counts condition is sufficient. However, the editorial and the sample solutions use the counts condition to decide.

 How to solve the equations?
   We can iterate over possible rA and rP? The maximum values: 
        rA: since 2*x = (A_g - A_i) + a * rA, so we require (A_g - A_i) + a * rA >=0 and even, and similarly for the other equation.

   But note: the operations also have to be nonnegative.

   Also, we have to consider that x and y must be nonnegative.

   Steps for one equation: 
        Let dA = A_g - A_i. Then: 2*x = dA + a * rA.
        Conditions: 
            (dA + a * rA) must be nonnegative and even, and then x = (dA + a * rA) // 2.

        Similarly for the other: dP = P_g - P_i, then 2*y = dP + p * rP, so same conditions.

   We can iterate rA from 0 to some bound? The bound: 
        Since dA = A_g - A_i, which is at least -50 and at most 50? But note: we are adding a * rA (a>=5) and we require nonnegative. So rA must be at least ceil(-dA/a) if dA negative? Actually, we require (dA + a * rA) >=0.

        Similarly for rP.

   However, we don't know the exact bound. But note: the number of operations k is bounded by 35000. But we are only iterating for rA and rP? We can set a safe bound: since the absolute value of dA is at most 50, and a>=5, then rA can be from 0 to, say, 50? Actually, worst-case: if dA is negative, then we need at least ceil(|dA|/a) for rA. Since |dA|<=50, and a>=5, then rA at most 10? Actually, 50/5=10. Similarly for positive? but then if dA is positive, then we might have rA=0? and then x = dA/2 (if dA even). 

   So we can iterate rA from 0 to (say) 50, and similarly rP from 0 to 50? Actually, 50 is safe because a>=5, so the maximum removal operations needed for A: (current A count - goal A count) / a? but if we have to remove, then dA = A_g - A_i is negative. So the maximum rA needed is (A_i - A_g) / a? and since A_i <=50, then at most 50/5=10. Similarly for P. So we can iterate rA from 0 to 20 (to be safe) and rP from 0 to 20.

   Then we check:
        Condition1: (dA + a * rA) is nonnegative, even, and then set x = (dA + a * rA) // 2 (nonnegative by the nonnegative condition).
        Condition2: (dP + p * rP) is nonnegative, even, and then set y = (dP + p * rP) // 2.

   If we find any (rA, rP) such that both conditions hold, then we have a solution.

 4. If no such (rA, rP) exists, output -1.

 5. If we have a solution (x, y, rA, rP), then we need to generate the operations.

 How to generate operations?
   The editorial suggests three patterns, but note that the operations can be interleaved arbitrarily. However, we have a constraint: the goal state must be achieved.

   We note two kinds of operations: expansions (op1 and op2) and removals (op3 and op4). 

   Important: expansions increase the length (by 2 per expansion) and removals decrease the length (by a or p). Also, the goal state is fixed.

   The total length change: 
        initial length = L_i, goal length = L_g.
        We have: L_i + 2*(x+y) - (a * rA + p * rP) = L_g.

   We have a solution for x,y,rA,rP so the length condition is satisfied.

   How to generate the operations? 

   We have two strategies:

   Strategy 1: Do all expansions first, then all removals.

   However, the removals require consecutive a or p, and the expansions might break the consecutive segments? 

   Alternatively, we can do:

   Step 1: Expand to build a superset of the goal, then remove the extra.

   But note: the expansions can be done in such a way that we build the goal from the inside? 

   Observing the sample operations:

   In the first sample: 
        PP -> P becomes APA: so at position 2: 
            S = "PP": 
                Operation: +P 2 -> becomes P (at1) then insert A at left of P2 and A at right: so becomes "P" (first) then "A" then "P" (the original P2) then "A" -> "P A P A" -> but wait: the positions: 
                The string becomes: [0] = P, [1] = A, [2] = P, [3] = A? 
                But the sample output says: 
                    PP → PAPA? Actually, the operation on the second particle: 
                    Original: [0]='P', [1]='P'
                    Operation on the second particle (i=2): 
                         We take the second particle (which is the last) and replace it with APA -> so we get: first particle remains, then we insert A to the left of the second particle and then A to the right? 
                         So: 
                            [0] = P (first particle)
                            [1] = A (inserted left of the second)
                            [2] = P (the second particle, now at position 3? but we call it the second? no: the particle that was at position 2 is now at position 2? because we inserted at its left and right? 

                    Actually, the operation replaces the i-th particle with three particles: 
                         [left_insert, the particle, right_insert] -> so the string becomes: 
                         [particles before i-1] + ['A', 'P', 'A'] for op1? 
                         But note: the operation is defined as: replace the character P at position i with "APA". So the entire string becomes: 
                         S[0:i-1] + "A" + "P" (the original) + "A" -> but wait, that would be replacing the P at i with "APA", meaning we are inserting two A's: one immediately to the left and one immediately to the right? 
                         So the new string: 
                             positions: 
                                 1 to i-1: same
                                 i: becomes the first A
                                 i+1: the original P (now at i+1)
                                 i+2: the second A

                         Therefore, the particle that was at i is now at i+1.

                    Similarly, for op2: replacing A at i with PAP: 
                         becomes: 
                             [1..i-1] + "P" + "A" + "P", so the original A is now at i+1.

   Therefore, when we do expansions, the original particle is shifted to the right by 1? Actually, we insert two new particles: one at position i (which becomes the new i-th) and one at position i+1 (which becomes the new (i+1)-th) and then the original particle becomes the (i+1)-th? Actually, no: we are inserting one particle to the left and one to the right. So the original particle is now at the next position? 

   Example: 
        String: "XY" (length=2). 
        If we apply op1 on the second particle (i=2): 
            We split the string: 
                from index0 to index0: "X"
                then we replace the second particle (which is 'Y') with "A Y A"? but the operation replaces the character at the second position with "AYA"? but that would be: 
                new string = "X" + "AYA" -> "XAYA", which is 4 characters.

            The positions: 
                Original: 
                    pos1: X, pos2: Y
                After: 
                    pos1: X
                    pos2: A
                    pos3: Y
                    pos4: A

            So the Y that was at position 2 is now at position 3? 

   Therefore, if we do multiple expansions, the particles that are expanded earlier will be shifted to the right by the insertions that occur to their left.

   How to generate the sequence?

   We have two sets of operations: expansions (x and y) and removals (rA and rP).

   We can do:

   Option A: 
        Do all expansions first (both op1 and op2) and then removals.

   But removals require consecutive segments. However, after expansions, we have a string that has the goal as a subsequence? Actually, we are building the goal by expanding the initial particles. The goal might be embedded in the expanded string.

   Alternatively, we can use a recursive or iterative method? But the constraints on the string length are small: initially at most 50, and the maximum expansion: we are adding 2*(x+y) characters, so maximum length is 50 + 2*(x+y) which might be large? But note: the counts of x and y are bounded by the equations: 
        x = (dA + a*rA) // 2, and dA = A_g - A_i, which is at most 50? and a>=5, so rA at most 10? then x at most (50+10*20)/2? Actually, worst-case: if A_g is 50 and A_i=0, then x = (50 + a*rA)/2. But rA can be 0, so x=25. Similarly, y can be at most 25. Then the maximum length is 50 + 2*(25+25)= 50+100=150? which is acceptable.

   So we can simulate the entire process? 

   Steps for generating the sequence:

   We have an initial string S.

   We need to perform:
        x times op1: each time we choose a proton and expand it to APA.
        y times op2: each time we choose an antiproton and expand it to PAP.
        rA times op3: remove a consecutive A's of length a.
        rP times op4: remove a consecutive P's of length p.

   But the removals can be done at the end? 

   However, the removals require consecutive segments. After expansions, the string might not have consecutive segments of length a or p? 

   Therefore, we must design the expansions so that we build the goal and then the extra particles are in consecutive blocks that we can remove.

   How about: 
        We want to end up with E. How can we build E from S?

        Note: We can also remove particles that are not contiguous? But the removal operation requires contiguous.

        Idea: 
            We can expand the particles in such a way that we build the goal as a contiguous substring in the middle? and then remove the extra particles on the sides? 

        But the goal might be arbitrary.

   Alternatively, we can use a known solution from the sample:

        Pattern 1: If we only have expansions (op1) and no removals, then we can only add symmetric A's around protons. This will generate a string that is symmetric around the original protons? 

        Example: PP -> expand the last P: becomes P, then expand the next to last: becomes P then expand the last (which is now the third) -> becomes P then expand the last (which is the fifth) -> becomes PAAAAPAAAA? Actually, the sample goal is PAAAAPAAAA, which has the structure: 
            P, then four A's, then a P, then four A's? 

        How to build that? 
            Start: "PP" -> we have two protons at positions 1 and 2.
            Step1: expand the second proton (at pos2): 
                becomes: "P" + "A" + "P" + "A" -> "PAPA" (positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:P, 4:A)
            Step2: expand the third proton (which is the original second proton, now at position 3): 
                becomes: "PA" + "A" + "P" + "A" -> "PAAPA"? 
                Actually, we replace the third particle (which is P) with APA -> so we get: 
                    positions: 
                        1: P, 2: A, then we replace the third (which is P) with A (at pos3), P (at pos4), A (at pos5) -> so the string becomes: "P A A P A" -> but then the last A from the first expansion is still at the end? 
                Actually, the entire string: 
                    original: "PAPA" -> we are expanding the proton at position 3? 
                    We break the string: 
                         first two: "PA", then the third is the P we want to expand -> we replace it with "APA": so we get "PA" + "APA" -> "PAAPA"? 
                    But then we have: 
                         [0] = 'P'
                         [1] = 'A'
                         [2] = 'A'   (inserted to the left of the proton at position 3)
                         [3] = 'P'   (the original proton at position 3, now at position 4? actually no: we inserted at its left and then put the proton and then the A at the right? 
                    Actually, the operation replaces the proton at position 3 with "A" (at position3), then the proton (at position4), then "A" (at position5). So the string becomes: 
                         positions: 
                             1: P (from the first)
                             2: A (from the first expansion)
                             3: A (inserted to the left of the proton we are expanding)
                             4: P (the proton we expanded, now at position4)
                             5: A (inserted to the right) -> and then we have the last A from the first expansion? 
                         But wait, the first expansion produced: 
                             originally: "P" (at1) then at2: A, then at3: P (from the second proton) then at4: A. 
                         Now we are expanding the proton at position3 (which is the one that was at position3 originally, but after the first expansion the second proton became two A's and a P in the middle? Actually, after the first expansion we had: 
                             [0]='P', [1]='A', [2]='P', [3]='A'. 
                         Now we expand the proton at position 3? but note: positions are 1-indexed. The third particle is the one at index2 (0-indexed) which is 'P'. We replace that P with "APA", so we get: 
                             [0]='P', [1]='A', then we break: we insert an A to the left of the third particle? but the third particle is the one at index2? so we insert at position2? 
                         Then the new string: 
                             [0:2] = ['P','A'] 
                             then we insert: 
                                 at position2: 'A'
                                 then the original P at position3? 
                                 then at position4: 'A'
                             then we have the last part: the original A at index3 (which becomes index5) -> so the string: 
                                 ['P','A','A','P','A','A'] -> "PAA P AA" -> but wait, the last A from the first expansion is at the end? 

                         Actually, the entire string becomes: "P" + "A" + "APA" (replacing the next P) + "A" (the last A from the first expansion)? 
                         That would be "P" + "A" + "A" (inserted left) + "P" (the expanded proton) + "A" (inserted right) + "A" -> "P A A P A A" -> which is 6 letters.

                    But the sample does 4 expansions? 

        Actually, the sample output does 4 expansions: 
            Step1: +P 2: PP -> PAPA (length4)
            Step2: +P 3: PAPA -> PAAPAA? or wait, let me compute: 
                After step1: positions: 
                    1: P, 2: A, 3: P, 4: A.
                Now expand the proton at position3: which is the third particle (the P at pos3). 
                We replace it: so we insert an A to the left of the third particle and an A to the right. 
                So: 
                    positions1: P, 2: A, then we insert at the left of the third: so we get at position3: A, then the original P becomes position4, then we insert A at position5, and then the last A (which was at position4) becomes position6? 
                So: 
                    [1] = P
                    [2] = A
                    [3] = A   (inserted left of the P that was at3)
                    [4] = P   (the proton that was at3, now at4)
                    [5] = A   (inserted right of the proton at3)
                    [6] = A   (the original last A from step1)

                -> "P A A P A A"

            Step3: expand the proton at position4: which is the proton at position4? 
                We replace that proton (at position4) with APA: 
                    So: 
                       [1] = P
                       [2] = A
                       [3] = A
                       [4] = A   (inserted left of the proton at4)
                       [5] = P   (the proton that was at4, now at5)
                       [6] = A   (inserted right of the proton at4)
                       [7] = A   (the A that was at5 becomes position7? and the A that was at6 becomes position8? 
                Actually, we break the string at the proton at position4: 
                    The first three: "P","A","A", then the fourth is the proton -> we replace that proton with "A" (at4), "P" (at5), "A" (at6). Then the rest: the two A's that were at5 and6 become positions7 and8? 
                So the string: 
                    "P","A","A","A","P","A","A","A" -> "PAAAPAAA"

            Step4: expand the proton at position5: which is the proton at position5? 
                Replace: 
                    We get: 
                        1: P, 2: A, 3: A, 4: A, then we insert at the left of the proton at5: an A (at5), then the proton (at6), then an A (at7). Then the rest: the A's that were at positions5,6,7,8 become positions8,9,10,11? 
                Actually: 
                    The first four: "P","A","A","A", then we replace the proton at5: 
                         becomes: 
                             at5: A, 
                             at6: P (the proton we are expanding),
                             at7: A
                         then we have the remaining: the existing A's that were after the proton: three A's? 
                    So: "P","A","A","A","A","P","A","A","A","A" -> that's 10 characters: PAAAAPAAAA -> which matches the goal.

        How did they choose the positions? 
            They expanded the last proton (the rightmost) first? and then the next proton that becomes the new rightmost? Actually, in the first expansion: they expanded the second proton (which was at the end). Then the next expansion: they expanded the proton that was originally the second one (which is now at position3, but note the string is now "PAPA", so the protons are at positions1 and3). They expanded the one at position3 (which is the last). Then again the last proton? 

        So the pattern: 
            We always expand the rightmost proton? 

        Why? Because if we expand a proton that is not at the end, then the insertions might break the consecutive A's that we want to remove later? But in this case we are not removing, so we don't care.

        However, for removals: we need consecutive segments. 

        How about if we have removals? 

        Consider the fourth sample: 
            Input: 8 9 PAPPPPPPPPP PPAP
            They output:
                2
                +A 2   (operation2 at position2: which is an A? but the string is "PAPPPPPPPPP": 
                    position1: P, position2: A, then 9 P's? 
                Then after op2: 
                    Replace the A at position2 with PAP: 
                         becomes: 
                             [0] = P (the first P)
                             then we break: we insert at the left of the A (which is at position2): a P -> so at position2: P
                             then the original A becomes position3: A? 
                             then we insert a P at position4? 
                         Then the rest: the 9 P's become positions5 to 13? 
                    So the string: "P" + "P" + "A" + "P" + "PPPPPPPPPP" -> "PPAPPPPPPPPP" (with 12 P's? actually the original A is replaced by PAP, so we have: 
                         positions: 
                            1: P, 
                            2: P (inserted left of A),
                            3: A (the original A),
                            4: P (inserted right of A),
                            5 to 13: the original 9 P's? -> total length: 1 + 3 + 9 = 13? 

                Then the next operation: -P 5: remove 9 consecutive protons starting at position5? 
                    The string: 
                         positions1: P, 2: P, 3: A, 4: P, 5: P, ... 13: P.
                    Removing 9 consecutive P's starting at position5: 
                         We remove positions5 to 13 (9 P's) -> leaves "PPAP" at positions1 to 4 -> which is the goal.

        How did they choose the positions? 
            They expanded the A at position2 to create a segment of consecutive P's at the end? Then they removed the consecutive P's at the end.

        Strategy:

        We can break the goal string into segments that are built from the initial particles? 

        However, a simpler method:

        Step 1: Expand all the particles (protons and antiprotons) that we are going to expand, but in a way that we create the goal as a contiguous substring at the beginning? and then have extra particles at the end? 

        How? 

        We note that we can expand particles arbitrarily, but we must leave the particles that we want to remain as the goal.

        Idea: 
            We can mark which particles in the initial string will become the goal? and which will be removed? 

        But the initial string might be too short.

        Alternatively, we can do:

        Step 1: Expand all the protons that need to be expanded (x times) and all the antiprotons that need to be expanded (y times) in any order, but always expanding the leftmost particle that is going to be expanded? 

        Why leftmost? Because if we expand the leftmost, then the particles to the right get shifted by 2 per expansion? 

        Then we have a string T of length = L_i + 2*(x+y). 

        Step 2: Then we remove the extra particles? 

        But how to ensure that the removals can remove the extra particles without affecting the goal? 

        We can arrange the expansions so that the goal is built at the left, and the extra particles are at the right? 

        How? 

        Consider: 
            We want to end up with E (the goal string) at the beginning? 

            We can do: 
                We start with S. 
                We traverse S from left to right. For each particle:
                    We don't expand the particles that we want to keep? 

            But the expansions are necessary to add the extra particles? 

        Actually, we can use the expansions to build the entire goal, and then remove the initial particles that are not part of the goal? 

        However, the expansions add two particles per operation, but the goal is fixed.

        Alternatively, we can use a method that builds the goal from left to right:

            We start with the initial string S.

            We are going to build the goal from left to right. 
            Let pointer i for the goal string E and pointer j for the current string.

            But the expansions are applied to existing particles. 

        This seems complex.

        Given the complexity and the constraints (goal string length <=50, and total operations bounded by 35000), we can simulate the entire process and use BFS? But 35000 operations per test and 10 test cases? and the state space: the string length can be up to 150? and 2^150 is too big.

        Therefore, we must generate the operations without simulation.

        Insight from the samples:

        Pattern: 
            We can expand the particles that we want to remain in the goal, and then remove the particles that we don't want.

        How? 

            Step 1: Expand the particles that are going to be kept, but do not expand the particles that are going to be removed? 

            However, we need to add particles via expansion? and then we remove the extra.

        Actually, we can do:

            We are going to keep the entire initial string? But then we need to add more particles? 

        Another idea: 

            We can remove the entire initial string and then build the goal from scratch? But we can only remove consecutive segments of a or p, and we start with the initial string.

        Alternatively, we can use the following known solution:

            Step 1: Use expansions (op1 and op2) to create the entire goal string, but embedded in the initial string? 

            Step 2: Then remove the extra particles that are not in the goal.

        How to do step1? 

            We can expand the particles that are in the initial string in an order that builds the goal? 

        Actually, note: the expansions can be used to insert particles in the middle? 

        However, the operations only allow expanding an existing particle by inserting two particles (one to the left and one to the right). So we can build a tree-like structure: 
            The initial particles are the leaves? 
            Then each expansion adds two leaves (one on the left and one on the right) and the expanded particle becomes the parent? 

        The goal string is a contiguous segment? 

        But we can also remove particles arbitrarily? 

        Proposed approach:

          We will do:

            Step 1: Expand all the required expansions (x for protons, y for antiprotons). But we do them in reverse order: that is, we build the goal from the inside out? 

          How? 

          Consider that the goal string E has a certain structure. We can think of the goal as built by expansions from a single seed particle? 

          Actually, we can use a recursive decomposition? 

          However, note: we have an initial string S.

        Alternatively, we can use the following method:

          We want to transform S into E. 

          We know that we can also remove particles. 

          We can do:

            Step 1: Expand all the particles that we are going to expand (x+y times). We do it in any order? but we do it in the reverse order of the goal? 

          But the sample fourth test case expanded an A to create PAP, which then became part of the goal? 

          How about we do:

            We start with S, and we want to end up with E. 

            We can also remove particles arbitrarily (if we have consecutive segments of a or p). 

          But note: the removals can be done only on consecutive segments of a or p. 

          Therefore, we must design the expansions so that the extra particles (that we are going to remove) form consecutive segments of a or p.

        After research, I found a known solution for a similar problem (CodeForces) that uses:

          Step 1: Use expansions to build a string that contains the goal as a contiguous substring, and the rest of the string consists of consecutive A's and consecutive P's that can be removed.

        Specifically:

          We will do:

            Expand the particles that are in the goal? and leave the particles that are not in the goal unexpanded? 

          But the particles that are not in the goal might be removed? 

        Actually, we can mark: 
            We need to end up with E, so the particles that are in the initial string that we want to keep must be expanded to form the goal? 

        Given the complexity, and since the constraints are small (|S|,|E|<=50, and total expansions and removals are bounded by 25+10=35 at worst, and total operations k<=35000, which is large), we can do:

          We simulate the entire process with a custom strategy:

          Strategy:

            Step 1: Expand all the particles that are in the initial string that are going to be expanded. But we do it in such a way that we build the goal string from left to right? 

          How? 

          We are going to build the goal string from the initial string by expanding the initial particles to form the goal. We do expansions on the particles that are going to be kept, and we do it in the order of the goal.

          But we also have to remove some particles.

        Another simpler idea:

          We know that we can remove only consecutive segments. So if we can arrange that the string after expansions has the goal as a contiguous substring and the rest of the string is made of a consecutive block of a*A or p*P that we can remove, then we can do:

            Step 1: Expand particles to build the entire goal string as a contiguous substring at the left, and then have a consecutive block of A's or P's at the right that we can remove in one operation? 

          But we might need to remove in several operations.

        How to build the goal at the left? 

          We start with S. 

          We will expand the particles in the initial string that are going to be part of the goal, but we do it in reverse order: from right to left? 

          Why? Because expanding a particle shifts the particles to the right of it.

          Specifically, if we expand the leftmost particle, then the entire string to the right shifts by 2? 

          If we expand the rightmost particle, then the particles to the right are not shifted? 

          So to minimize disturbance, we can expand the particles from right to left.

          Example: 
              S = "PP", we want to build "PAAAAPAAAA" (which is 10 letters).

          We know we need to expand 4 times. 

          We do:

            Expand the rightmost proton first: 
                After first expansion: "PAPA" -> the goal we want starts with 'P' and then a block of A's and then a P, etc. 

          But after the first expansion, we have two protons: at position1 and position3. 

          Then we expand the proton at position3 (which is the rightmost) -> becomes "PAAPAA" -> then expand the rightmost proton (which is now at position5) -> becomes "PAAAPAAA", then expand the proton at position7? -> "PAAAAAPAAAA"

          But the goal is "PAAAAPAAAA", which is P followed by 4 A's, then a P, then 4 A's. 

          The string we built: 
                P, then A, then A, then A, then A, then A, then P, then A, then A, then A, then A -> that's 11 letters? 

          Actually, let me count: 
            Start: PP -> length2.
            Step1: expand the last P: becomes P A P A -> length4.
            Step2: expand the last P (which is at position3): 
                becomes: P, A, then expand the P: insert A to the left and right -> so we get: P, A, A, P, A, and then the last A from step1? -> no, we replaced the last P? 
                Actually, after step1: positions: 
                    1: P, 2: A, 3: P, 4: A.
                Expand position3: 
                    We break: 
                        1: P, 2: A, then we replace the P at3: 
                            insert A at3, then P at4, then A at5.
                    Then the last A (which was at4) becomes at6? 
                So: 1:P, 2:A, 3:A, 4:P, 5:A, 6:A -> length6.
            Step3: expand the last P (at position4? because the last P is at4) -> 
                becomes: 
                  1: P, 2:A, 3:A, then expand the P at4: 
                      insert A at4, then P at5, then A at6.
                then the rest: the two A's that were at5 and6 become at7 and8?
                So: 1:P, 2:A, 3:A, 4:A, 5:P, 6:A, 7:A, 8:A -> length8.
            Step4: expand the last P (at position5): 
                  1:P, 2:A, 3:A, 4:A, then expand the P at5: 
                      insert A at5, then P at6, then A at7.
                then the rest: the three A's that were at6,7,8 become at8,9,10.
                So: 1:P, 2:A, 3:A, 4:A, 5:A, 6:P, 7:A, 8:A, 9:A, 10:A -> length10: "PAAAA" then "PAAAA" -> PAAAAPAAAA? 
                But wait, it's "P" then 4 A's, then "P", then 4 A's -> yes.

          So the strategy for expansions: 
            For each expansion we wish to do, we expand the rightmost particle of the type we wish to expand.

          Why rightmost? 
            Because expanding the rightmost particle does not shift any particle that we haven't expanded yet? and we can continue expanding the new rightmost particle? 

          So for op1: we expand the rightmost proton that we can expand? 
          For op2: we expand the rightmost antiproton that we can expand? 

          Then for removals: 
            After we have built the entire string, we will have the goal at the left and extra particles at the right? 

          But note: we might have extra particles in the middle? 

          How to remove? 

          We can remove from the right: if we have a consecutive block of a A's or p P's at the right, we remove it. But what if the extra particles are not at the right? 

          The expansions we did (expanding the rightmost) should leave the goal at the left and the extra particles at the right? 

          Why? 

          Because we never expanded the extra particles? 

          But wait, we expanded every particle that we are going to expand. The goal is built by expanding the initial particles. The initial string might have particles that we wish to remove? 

          How to handle that? 

          We must not expand the particles that we wish to remove. 

          Therefore, we need to know which particles in the initial string will be kept and which will be removed.

          How? 

          The removals: we are going to remove rA times of a A's and rP times of p P's. 

          The particles to be removed must come from the initial string and not from expansions? 

          But note: we can also remove expanded particles? 

          The sample fourth test case removed expanded particles: 
              They expanded an A to become PAP, and then removed the P's that were inserted and the ones that were originally there? 

          Therefore, we can remove any consecutive segment, even if it contains expanded particles.

          So we can do:

            Step 1: Expand the particles that we are going to expand (both the ones that will be kept and the ones that will be removed? but then the expanded particles might become part of the goal? 

          This is complex.

        Given the complexity, and since the problem says we don't need to minimize k, and any sequence of at most 35000 is accepted, we can do the following:

          We will do:

            Step 1: Expand every particle in the initial string that is going to be expanded? But we don't know which ones are which? 

          Actually, we know the counts: 
            We need to do x expansions on protons and y expansions on antiprotons.

          How to choose which ones? 
            We can expand the rightmost ones? 

          Step 2: Then, we remove the extra particles. 

          But how to remove? 
            We remove from left to right? or from right to left? 

          We can try to remove the consecutive segments that are not part of the goal? 

          But how to identify the goal in the expanded string? 

        Alternatively, we can build the entire goal by doing expansions only on the particles that are in the goal, and then remove the particles that are not in the goal? 

        However, we might not know in advance which initial particles are kept.

        We can do:

          We will not expand the particles that we are going to remove. 

          How? 

          We first remove some particles from the initial string? 

          But removal operations can be done only on consecutive segments. We might not have consecutive segments initially.

        Therefore, we do:

          Step 1: Remove as much as possible from the initial string? 

          But the counts equations account for the net change.

        Given the time, and since the editorial guidelines suggest following the sample patterns, we will:

          For the given sample patterns:

            If we only have expansions (like sample1), then expand the rightmost proton repeatedly.

            If we have an expansion of an A and then remove P's (like sample4), then do:
                op2 on the A (which is at a specific position) and then remove a block of P's.

          But how to know the positions for removal? 

          In sample4: 
              initial: "PAPPPPPPPPP" (length=11: positions:1:P, 2:A, 3 to 11: P's)
              We expanded the A at position2: 
                  new string: "P" + (inserted P at the left of A? then the A, then inserted P at the right) + the 9 P's -> "PPAP" + 9 P's -> "PPAPPPPPPPPP" (length=12+? 3 inserted for the A, and the 9 P's -> total 1+3+9=13)
              Then we removed 9 consecutive P's starting at position5: 
                  The string: 
                      positions1: P, 2: P, 3: A, 4: P, then positions5 to 13: 9 P's.
                  So we remove from position5 to position13 (9 P's) -> leaves "PPAP".

          How did they choose position5? 
              Because the 9 consecutive P's start at position5.

          How to compute that? 
              After expanding the A at position2, the string is:
                  positions1: P (the first proton)
                  position2: P (inserted left of the A)
                  position3: A (the expanded A)
                  position4: P (inserted right of the A)
                  positions5 to 13: the original 9 P's.

          So the consecutive P's from position5 to 13 are 9 in a row.

        Therefore, we can do:

          Step 1: If we have to expand an antiproton (y>0), find the leftmost antiproton in the current string and expand it. Then the removal of P's will be on the consecutive P's that appear after the expansion? 

          But what if the goal is not at the beginning? 

        Generalizing for the fourth sample: 

          We had to remove rP=1 time (remove 9 consecutive P's). 

          We did one expansion on an A (which was in the initial string) and then removal of the 9 consecutive P's at the end.

        Can we generalize to multiple expansions and removals? 

        Proposed algorithm for generating operations:

          We are given x, y, rA, rP.

          We start with the initial string S.

          We will maintain the current string as a list of characters, and also we will maintain the current length and the positions.

          But note: the problem allows any valid sequence, and the string length is at most 50 + 2*(x+y) <= 150, and the total operations is x+y+rA+rP <= 25+25+10+10 = 70, which is small.

          Therefore, we can simulate the operations! 

          Steps for one test case:

            Let current_string = list(S)   (0-indexed internally, but we output 1-indexed positions)

            We know the counts: we need to do x times op1, y times op2, rA times op3, rP times op4.

            We will do:

              Step 1: Do all the expansions (op1 and op2). 
                     For each expansion:
                         For op1: we need to find a proton. We choose the rightmost proton? 
                         For op2: we choose the rightmost antiproton? 

              Why rightmost? 
                 Because then the expansion happens at the right part, and the left part remains as the goal we are building? 

              But we want to build the goal, which might be arbitrary. 

              However, we will remove the extra particles later, so it doesn't matter where we expand as long as we do the required number of expansions.

              But note: the goal might require specific placements. 

              How can we be sure that after expansions and removals we get the goal? 

              We will remove the extra particles by consecutively remove the consecutive segments of a A's or p P's that are not in the goal? 

              But we need to know the goal in the current string? 

              Alternatively, after doing all expansions, we will have a string T. 
              Then we need to remove particles so that we get E. 
              How to remove? 
                 We can use a greedy removal from the right: 
                     while the current_string is not E:
                         if there is a consecutive block of a A's at the end, remove them (and they must be at the end, not in the middle) 
                         else if there is a consecutive block of p P's at the end, remove them.
                         else, then we try to remove a block that is not at the end? but removal can be anywhere as long as it is consecutive.

              However, the problem does not require that the removal is at the end. 

              But if we remove from the middle, we might break the goal? 

              Therefore, we must remove only the extra particles that are not part of the goal. 

              How to identify extra particles? 

              Since the goal is E, and we know E, we can try to match E as a contiguous substring in the current string T. 

              But there might be multiple occurrences? 

              We can find the leftmost occurrence of E in T. Then the particles to the left of this occurrence and to the right are extra. 

              Then we remove the extra particles from the left and right? 

              But removal operations can only remove consecutive segments of a A's or p P's. 

              So we require that the extra particles on the left and right form consecutive segments of length at least a or p? 

              How to ensure that? 

          Given the complexity, and since the sample only does one removal at the end, and the fourth sample only had extra particles at the end, we can try to build the goal at the left and the extra particles at the right. 

          How to build the goal at the left? 

             We do expansions only on the particles that are in the goal? 

          Alternatively, we can use a simpler method for removal:

            Step 2: Removal phase: 
               We will remove from the current_string to leave the goal string E. 

               How? 
                 We can try to remove the extra particles from the right and left in blocks of a or p. 

               But note: removal of a block of a A's or p P's can be done anywhere. 

               We can use a two-pointer to find the goal as a subsequence? 

               But we need consecutive goal. 

               We can find the goal as a contiguous substring in the current string? 

               If there is exactly one occurrence of E as a contiguous substring in T, then we remove everything to the left and to the right. 

               But the left part and the right part might not be removable in one shot if they are not of length a or p? 

               We can remove in multiple operations? 

               For example, if we have extra 5 A's on the left, and a=5, then we remove them in one op3. If we have extra 10 A's, then we remove two blocks of 5.

               But what if the extra part is not homogeneous? 

               Example: extra part has both A and P? 

          However, after doing expansions in any order, the string might be mixed.

        Given the complexity and the constraints (the total string length is at most 150), we can use a brute-force for the removal phase:

          We will simulate removals as follows:

            We wish to remove particles until the string becomes E.

            We will use a queue: 

            However, the state space might be large: 150 characters, but we have at most 70 operations.

          Alternatively, we can do:

            We will try to remove from the leftmost extra particle or the rightmost extra particle? 

            Specifically, we can:

              while current_string != E:
                  Look for a contiguous block of a A's anywhere in the string that is not part of the goal? But we don't know which ones are part of the goal.

            How about: 

              We know the goal string E, so we know which particles must remain. We can mark the particles that are in the goal? 

              But note: there might be duplicate and the same letter might appear in both goal and extra.

            Alternatively, we can use an iterative removal of the leftmost extra particle? but we can only remove in blocks of a or p.

          This is complex.

        Given the time, and since the problem is small, we can use the following safe method for removal:

          We will try to remove from the rightmost part of the string first: 
              Check if the last a characters are A's -> then remove them.
              Else, check if the last p characters are P's -> then remove them.
              Else, then we look for a consecutive block of a A's or p P's anywhere in the string that is not overlapping with the goal? 

          But how to avoid breaking the goal? 

          We know that the goal must appear as a contiguous substring. Let's assume we have matched the goal in the current string. Then we can remove any consecutive block that is not within the matched goal.

          How to match the goal? 

            We can find the goal as a contiguous substring in the current string. We choose the leftmost occurrence.

          Steps for removal:

            Let n = len(current_string), m = len(E)

            We find the leftmost occurrence of E in current_string. Let the match be from index L to index L+m-1.

            Then the extra particles are:
                prefix = current_string[0:L]
                suffix = current_string[L+m:]

            Now, we need to remove the prefix and the suffix, and also any part that is not matched in the middle? But the entire string must be the goal and the extra, and we assume the goal appears contiguously.

            How to remove prefix? 
                We can only remove consecutive segments of a A's or p P's. 
                So we break the prefix into consecutive segments of A's and P's. 
                Then for each segment:
                    if it is a block of A's of length = k, then we can remove it in floor(k/a) * a? but we have to remove exactly a at a time. 
                    However, if k is not a multiple of a, then we cannot remove it? 

            But wait, we can remove only one contiguous block of exactly a A's at a time? 

            The problem says: "remove a consecutive particles" -> meaning we remove a contiguous segment of exactly a A's.

            So we can only remove a block if it has at least a consecutive A's. And we can remove one block of a A's at a time.

            Similarly for P's.

            Therefore, for the prefix and suffix, we require that they are composed of consecutive blocks of A's and P's, and each block of A's has length divisible by a? and each block of P's has length divisible by p? 

            But that's not true: we can remove one block at a time, and after removal, the string changes, so the blocks might change.

            Example: 
                prefix = "AAAP", a=3, p= something: 
                    We have a block of 3 A's: we can remove the first three A's, then we are left with "P", which is not removable (if p>1).

            So this approach fails.

        Given the complexity, and since the problem states that any sequence of at most 35000 is acceptable, we can do a BFS-like removal? 

        But 35000 states might be the total number of operations, but the state space of the string (which is up to 150 characters) is 2^150 which is too big.

        Therefore, we need a better method.

        After reading the sample outputs, they never did more than 4 expansions and 1 removal. 

        So we can assume that the removal phase will be short.

        Proposed removal: 
          We will try to remove from the right: 
            while the current_string is longer than m (the length of E):
                Check if there is a consecutive segment of a A's at the very end? 
                Or of p P's at the very end?
                If yes, remove the last a or last p.
                Else, then check if there is a consecutive segment of a A's or p P's anywhere in the string that is at the end of the string? 

          But what if the extra particles are at the left? 

          Then we remove from the left: 
                while the current_string is longer than m:
                    if the first a characters are A's -> remove them
                    else if the first p characters are P's -> remove them
                    else: then we try the right? 

          But the sample might have the goal in the middle.

        How about we find the goal as a contiguous substring? 
            We find the leftmost occurrence of E in the current_string. 
            Then we remove everything to the left of it and everything to the right of it.

            For the left part: 
                We remove from the leftmost: 
                    while the left part is nonempty:
                        if the leftmost a characters are A's, remove them.
                        else if the leftmost p characters are P's, remove them.
                        else: then we try to remove a block that starts at position1 and hope that after removal the goal is still there? 

            For the right part: similarly.

          This might work if the left part and right part are removable in chunks of a or p.

          But what if the left part is not homogeneous? 

          Example: left part is "AP", a=2, p=2 -> then we cannot remove any block? 

          However, a and p are at least 5, and the length of the extra part might be >=5.

          But the left part might be short.

        Given the complexity, and since the problem is small, we can do a while loop: 

          to_remove_left = current_string[0: L]   # L is the start index of the goal
          to_remove_right = current_string[L+m: ]

          then we remove to_remove_left from the left, and to_remove_right from the right, by repeatedly removing from the left for the left part and from the right for the right part.

          For the left part:
            index = 0
            while index < L:
                if from index there is a consecutive a A's starting at index: then we remove them (op3 at position index+1) and then we update: current_string becomes current_string[0:index] + current_string[index+a:], and L = L - a, but wait the goal shifts.
                similarly for P's.

          But then the removal of a block in the left part will shift the entire string to the left by a, so the goal shifts left by a.

          Similarly for the right part: removal in the right part does not shift the goal.

          However, removal in the left part shifts the goal.

          Therefore, we can do:

            // Remove the left part:
            while the left part is not empty:
                found = False
                // try to remove a block of a A's at the very left
                if L>=a and current_string[0:a] is 'A'*a:
                    output: `-A 1`
                    current_string = current_string[a:]
                    L -= a   // the goal starts at L, which is now reduced by a
                    found = True
                else if L>=p and current_string[0:p] is 'P'*p:
                    output: `-P 1`
                    current_string = current_string[p:]
                    L -= p
                    found = True
                // if not at the very left, we might find a block within the left part, but the removal can be anywhere as long as it is consecutive and within [0, L-1]
                else:
                    for i in range(0, L - a + 1):
                        if current_string[i:i+a] == 'A'*a:
                            output: '-A i+1' 
                            current_string = current_string[0:i] + current_string[i+a:]
                            if i < L: 
                                L -= a   // the goal shifts left by a
                            else:
                                # but i should be in [0, L-1] so the goal is at L, then after removal, the goal starts at L - a? 
                            found = True
                            break
                    if not found:
                        for i in range(0, L - p + 1):
                            if current_string[i:i+p] == 'P'*p:
                                output: '-P i+1'
                                current_string = current_string[0:i] + current_string[i+p:]
                                if i < L:
                                    L -= p
                                found = True
                                break
                if not found:
                    # This should not happen, but if it does, then we return -1 even though we thought it was feasible by counts?
                    # But counts are necessary, not sufficient.
                    print("This should not happen! We have a solution by counts but removal fails")
                    return -1

            Similarly for the right part: 
                R = L + m   // the index after the goal
                while len(current_string) > R:
                    n = len(current_string)
                    // try the last a characters
                    if n - R >= a and current_string[n-a: n] == 'A'*a:
                        output: '-A n-a+1' 
                        current_string = current_string[0:n-a]
                        found = True
                    else if n - R >= p and current_string[n-p: n] == 'P'*p:
                        output: '-P n-p+1'
                        current_string = current_string[0:n-p]
                        found = True
                    else:
                        // try any block in the right part (from R to the end)
                        for i in range(R, n - a + 1):
                            if current_string[i:i+a] == 'A'*a:
                                output: '-A i+1'
                                current_string = current_string[0:i] + current_string[i+a:]
                                found = True
                                break
                        if not found:
                            for i in range(R, n - p + 1):
                                if current_string[i:i+p] == 'P'*p:
                                    output: '-P i+1'
                                    current_string = current_string[0:i] + current_string[i+p:]
                                    found = True
                                    break
                    if not found:
                        // error
                        print("removal of right part failed")
                        return -1

          Then after removing left and right, we have the goal.

        But note: the left part removal might not find a block because the left part might be short and not have a consecutive a A's or p P's? 

        However, a and p are at least 5, and the left part might be shorter than a and p? 

        Example: left part has length 3, a=5 -> then we cannot remove. 

        Therefore, this removal method might fail.

        We must remove the entire left part and right part. How about we remove from the entire string (not just the left part) as long as the block is not overlapping with the goal? 

        Specifically, any block in the prefix or in the suffix is safe. Also, we can remove a block in the prefix that overlaps into the goal? -> that would break the goal.

        So we can only remove blocks that are entirely in the prefix or entirely in the suffix.

        Therefore, in the left part, we can only remove a block if it is entirely within [0, L-1]. In the right part, entirely within [L+m, n-1].

        And if the left part has a block of a A's or p P's that is not at the beginning, we can remove it and then the prefix becomes shorter and the goal shifts left.

        But what if the left part is "AA", a=5? then we cannot remove it. -> then the counts condition might be satisfied but we cannot remove.

        Therefore, the counts condition is not sufficient. 

        But the problem says: "It can be shown that there’s always a sequence of operations satisfying this bound for k if the initial state can be transformed into the goal state at all."

        And we are outputting -1 if the counts have no solution.

        But if the counts have a solution, then there exists a way, so the removal will be possible.

        Therefore, we must have that the extra particles can be partitioned into segments of length a (for A's) and p (for P's) that are not necessarily contiguous? 

        But removal requires contiguous segments. 

        However, we can remove one contiguous segment at a time, and after removal, the string changes and new contiguous segments might form.

        In summary, we will do the following for the entire test case:

          t = number of test cases (<=10)

          for each test case:
              read a, p, S, E

              compute counts: 
                 A_i = count of 'A' in S
                 P_i = count of 'P' in S
                 A_g = count of 'A' in E
                 P_g = count of 'P' in E

              solve the equations for nonnegative integers (x, y, rA, rP) such that:
                2*x = A_g - A_i + a * rA   and A_g - A_i + a * rA >=0 and even.
                2*y = P_g - P_i + p * rP   and P_g - P_i + p * rP >=0 and even.

              If no solution, output -1.

              Otherwise, choose a solution (any) with the smallest rA and then smallest rP? or iterate rA and rP in increasing order.

              Let current_string = S (as a list of characters)

              expansions = []   # list of operations for expansions
              removals = []     # list of operations for removals, but we will do expansions first.

              Step 1: Do the expansions.

                  We will do the expansions in any order, but we will do the rightmost first to avoid shearing the left part.

                  Specifically, we will do:
                    for _ in range(x):
                        # find the rightmost 'P' in current_string
                        pos = -1
                        for i in range(len(current_string)-1, -1, -1):
                            if current_string[i] == 'P':
                                pos = i
                                break
                        if pos == -1:
                            # This should not happen because we have enough P's? 
                            # But note: we might have expanded some P's and then they became 'A'? 
                            # But expansion on a P: we replace it with 'A','P','A'. So the P is still there.
                            # Therefore, the count of P's does not decrease by expansion. In fact, it increases by one (because we add one P in the expansion? no: we start with one P and replace it with one P and two A's, so the number of P's remains the same for that particle? 
                            # But wait, we are doing op1 on a proton: we replace one P with APA -> which has one P. So the total number of P's does not change. Therefore, we should have at least one P initially? 
                            # But we have x expansions on protons, and initially we had P_i protons, and we haven't removed any yet, so we should have at least x protons.
                            # But we may have expanded some already, and the ones we expanded are still protons? 
                            # So the count of protons is always P_i (until we remove some).
                            # So if we are doing x expansions, and x <= P_i, then we should have at least one P.
                            # But note: we might have removed some protons in the removal phase? But we haven't done removal yet.
                            # Therefore, we should have at least one P.

                            # So if we get here, it's an error.
                            break

                        # Apply op1 at position = pos+1 (1-indexed)
                        # Replace the proton at pos with 'A','P','A'
                        # In the list: 
                        #   current_string = current_string[0:pos] + ['A','P','A'] + current_string[pos+1:]
                        # But wait, we are replacing the character at pos with three characters? 
                        current_string = current_string[:pos] + ['A', 'P', 'A'] + current_string[pos+1:]
                        expansions.append(('+P', pos+1))

                    similarly for y:
                        for _ in range(y):
                            # find the rightmost 'A'
                            pos = -1
                            for i in range(len(current_string)-1, -1, -1):
                                if current_string[i] == 'A':
                                    pos = i
                                    break
                            if pos == -1:
                                break
                            current_string = current_string[:pos] + ['P','A','P'] + current_string[pos+1:]
                            expansions.append(('+A', pos+1))

              Step 2: Find the goal in the current_string.

                  Let T = ''.join(current_string)
                  Find the leftmost occurrence of E in T. 
                  If not found, then we try to see if there is an occurrence, but the removal might be possible in a different way? 

                  Actually, if we have the counts satisfied, then the goal must appear as a substring? 

                  But the expansions might have built the goal with extra in between? 

                  Example: goal is "AA", and we have "A" then expanded an proton in the middle then "A" -> then the string is "A", then a block from expansion, then "A", and the goal "AA" is not contiguous.

              This indicates a flaw: the expansions might have built the goal non-contiguously.

          Given the complexity, and since the sample cases have the goal contiguous and at the beginning, and the expansion are done in a symmetric way, we might assume that the goal appears contiguously.

          But the fourth sample: 
               after expanding the A, we had "PPAP" in the beginning and then 9 P's. 
               Then we removed the 9 P's -> then the goal "PPAP" is at the beginning.

          How to ensure the goal is built contiguously at the beginning? 

          We did expansions on the rightmost, so the left part remains unchanged? 

          In the fourth sample: 
               S = "PAPPPPPPPPP"
               We expanded the A at position2: 
                   The left part: the first character 'P' remains, then we insert a P to the left of the A, then the A becomes 'P','A','P', and then the 9 P's. 
                   so the string becomes: 
                         [0] = 'P' (first)
                         [1] = 'P' (inserted left of A)
                         [2] = 'A' 
                         [3] = 'P' (inserted right of A)
                         [4:12] = 'P'*9 
                   -> "PPAP" + 'P'*9

          So the goal "PPAP" is at the beginning.

          Why? Because the expansion happened to the right of the first P, and we inserted a P to the left of the A and then the A and then a P, so the first four are "PPAP", and then the rest.

          In general, if we always expand the rightmost, then the left part remains unchanged.

          Therefore, the initial part of the string (up to the expansion point) remains. 

          So if we do not expand the particles in the left part, then the left part remains as the original. 

          But the goal might not be the original left part. 

          How about if we only expand the particles that are not in the goal? 

          This is complex.

        Due to the complexity and the time, and since the problem constraints are small (|S|,|E|<=50, and the total operations is at most 70) and there are only 10 test cases, we can use a BFS with the entire string as state? 

        But the string length is up to 150, and there are 2^150 states, which is too many.

        Therefore, we must rely on the following: 

          After expansions, the goal must appear as a contiguous substring in the current_string.

          How to ensure that? 

          We can expand in such a way that the goal is built. 

          Given the time, I will output a solution that works for the sample and hope for the best.

          Specifically, we will assume that after doing the expansions (on the rightmost) the string will contain the goal at the beginning. 

          Why at the beginning? 

             Because we never touch the left part.

          In the sample1: 
               S = "PP", and we expand the last P first, then the new last P, and so on -> then the string becomes "PAAAAPAAAA", which has the goal at the beginning.

          In sample3: 
               S = "PPAAAAAAAAP", and we only do removal: so the goal "PPAP" is at the beginning.

          In sample4: 
               after expansion, the goal "PPAP" is at the beginning.

          Therefore, we can assume that the goal is at the beginning of the current_string after the expansions.

          Is this always true? 

          Consider: 
             S = "AP", goal = "PA"

          We have to do:
             For S: A_i=1, P_i=1.
             For goal: A_g=1, P_g=1.
             The equations: 
                 2*x = 1-1 + a * rA = a * rA -> x = (a * rA)//2
                 2*y = 1-1 + p * rP = p * rP -> y = (p * rP)//2
             We want to minimize operations? or any solution. We can take rA=0, rP=0, then x=0,y=0.

          Then we don't do any expansion. 
          Then the current_string = "AP", and the goal is "PA", which is not at the beginning.

          So we must have a removal phase that can also remove the entire string and then we are left with nothing? 

          But the goal is not at the beginning.

          Therefore, we must be able to remove the entire string and then build the goal? 

          But we cannot build from nothing.

          How did the goal of "PA" get built? 

          We have to use expansion on the A in the initial "AP": 
             We do op2 on the A: 
                 becomes: "PAP" -> "PAP"
             Then we remove the last 'P'? if p=1, but p>=5, so we cannot remove one P.

          So it's not possible? 

          But let me check the counts: 
             We want to go from S="AP" to E="PA", 
             A_i=1, P_i=1; A_g=1, P_g=1.

          The equations: 
             A: 1 + 2*x - a * rA = 1  => 2*x = a * rA.
             P: 1 + 2*y - p * rP = 1  => 2*y = p * rP.

          So we have: x = (a * rA)/2, y = (p * rP)/2.

          We can take rA=2, then x = a, which is at least 5. 
          and rP=2, then y = p, at least 5.

          Then the number of expansions is a+p>=10, and removal operations is 4.

          This is within 35000, but can we do it? 

          We would have to build a string that has the goal "PA" embedded, and then remove the extra.

          Given the complexity, and since the problem sample might not include such test, and the problem says "If the transformation is impossible, output -1", and the counts condition is not satisfied for rA=0 and rP=0, but it is satisfied for rA=2, then we will try to generate the operations.

          But then the string after expansions might not have the goal at the beginning.

          Therefore, we must then search for the goal as a substring anywhere.

          In the example: 
             after doing 5 expansions on protons and 5 on antiprotons, the string might be long, but we hope that the goal "PA" appears as a contiguous substring.

          Given the time, we will do the following for removal after expansions:

             T = current_string (after expansions)
             m = len(E)
             occurrences = []
             for i in range(0, len(T)-m+1):
                 if T[i:i+m] == E:
                     occurrences.append(i)

             if not occurrences:
                 # This means the goal is not a contiguous substring in T.
                 # Try to see if we can do some removals and then the goal appears? 
                 # But the problem counts condition is satisfied, so there must be a way.
                 # Output -1? 
                 # But the editorial says the counts condition is sufficient.
                 # We must have a method to remove extra particles and end up with the goal.
                 # How? 
                 # We may remove particles that are between the letters of the goal? 
                 # But the goal is not contiguous.

                 # Therefore, we output -1 even though the counts are satisfied.
                 # This is against the problem.

                 # Instead, we will try to remove as described above: remove any removable block until the string becomes E.
                 # But how to ensure we get to E? 

                 # We will do a BFS with state = T, and we have at most 35000 operations overall.

                 # But the state space is the string, which can be up to 150 in length and 2^150 states, which is too big.

                 # Therefore, we output -1 for now.

             else:
                 choose the leftmost occurrence at index L.
                 then remove the prefix [0:L] and the suffix [L+m: len(T)] as described.

          Given the complexity, and since the sample cases are passing, and the problem says there is a sequence if the counts are satisfied, we hope that the goal appears as a contiguous substring.

        Given the time, I will output the solution for the sample cases.

        Summary of the algorithm for one test case:

          Step 1: Solve the linear equations for nonnegative integers (x, y, rA, rP). If no solution, output -1.

          Step 2: 
             current_string = list(S)
             operations = []

             # Do x times op1: on the rightmost 'P' in the current string
             for _ in range(x):
                 find the rightmost 'P' in current_string (scan from right)
                 if not found, then break with an error (but we should have enough P's)
                 else, replace that 'P' with ['A','P','A'] -> this is one expansion of a proton.
                 record the operation: '+P', at position = index+1

             # Do y times op2: on the rightmost 'A'
             for _ in range(y):
                 find the rightmost 'A'
                 if not found, break with an error.
                 replace that 'A' with ['P','A','P']
                 record the operation: '+A', at position = index+1

             T = ''.join(current_string)
             if T == E:
                 # then we are done, output the operations.
                 pass
             else:
                 # Find the leftmost occurrence of E in T.
                 pos = T.find(E)
                 if pos == -1:

                     # output -1 for now, but the problem says it's always possible if counts are satisfied.
                     # So we try to use removal to get to E, even if the goal is not contiguous.
                     # But removal only removes in chunks of a or p, and the final string must be E.

                     # We are not sure how, so output -1.
                     print("Though the counts are satisfied, we cannot find the goal as a substring")
                     # For the sample, this should not happen.
                     # We will output -1 for the test case.
                     # But the sample fourth had a substring, so we -1 for this test case.

                     # However, the problem sample second is -1 by counts, so we don't get here.

                     # Let's skip this test case and output -1.
                     # But then we already did expansions? we must output a sequence.

                     # We will not output -1 at this point. Instead, we will try to remove until we get to E.

                 else:

                    # We have the current_string as a list, and we will simulate removal in the left part.

                    # However, note: after we remove a block, the string changes and the goal may shift.

                    # We will simulate:

                    # We will remove from the beginning of the string until we remove the left part.

                            for j in range(0, len(right_part)-a+1):
                                if right_part[j:j+a] == 'A'*a:
                                    operations.append(('-A', len(E) + j+1))

                            if not found:

                            if not found:

                                break

                    if operations is None or right_part != '':
                        output -1.

          Step 3: Output the operations.

        Given the complexity, and since the sample cases are small, we hope this works.

        Let's run the sample1: 
            S = "PP", E = "PAAAAPAAAA", a=13, p=10.
            Counts: 
                A_i=0, P_i=2
                A_g=8, P_g=2   (because "PAAAAPAAAA" has 8 A's and 2 P's)
                Equations:
                  2*x = 8 - 0 + 13 * rA  => 2*x = 8 + 13 * rA.
                  2*y = 2 - 2 + 10 * rP = 10 * rP -> y = 5 * rP.

                We want nonnegative integers. 
                For rA=0: 2*x=8 -> x=4.
                For rP=0: y=0.

                So x=4, y=0, rA=0, rP=0.

            Then we do 4 expansions on the rightmost 'P' in the current_string.

            Step0: current_string = ['P','P']
            Step1: expand the last 'P' (at index1): 
                   becomes: ['P'] + ['A','P','A']  -> "PAPA" -> but wait, we replaced the last P with APA, so:
                   positions: 
                     0: 'P' -> remains
                     1: we replace the 'P' at index1: so we put 'A' at1, 'P' at2, 'A' at3.
                   so the list: ['P','A','P','A'] -> not "PAPA" is correct.

            Step2: expand the rightmost 'P' (which is now at index2): 
                   replace index2: which is 'P' -> with ['A','P','A']
                   new string: 
                         [0]='P', [1]='A', [2]='A', [3]='P', [4]='A', [5]='A'? 
                   Actually: 
                         current_string = current_string[0:2] + ['A','P','A'] + current_string[3:]
                         But initially: ['P','A','P','A'] 
                         We are replacing the element at index2: which is 'P'
                         So: 
                             [0:2] = ['P','A'] 
                             then insert ['A','P','A'] 
                             then the rest: current_string[3:] = ['A'] 
                         So: ['P','A','A','P','A','A'] 

            Step3: expand the rightmost 'P' (at index3): 
                   Similarly: 
                         replace the 'P' at index3: 
                         current_string = ['P','A','A'] + ['A','P','A'] + ['A','A'] 
                         = ['P','A','A','A','P','A','A','A'] 

            Step4: expand the rightmost 'P' (at index4): 
                   ['P','A','A','A'] + ['A','P','A'] + ['A','A','A'] 
                   = "PAAAA" then "P" then "AAAA" -> "PAAAAPAAAA" -> wait, that's 11 letters: 
                         P, A, A, A, A, P, A, A, A, A -> that's 10 letters.

                   Count: 
                      positions: 
                        0: 'P'
                        1: 'A'
                        2: 'A'
                        3: 'A'
                        4: 'A'
                        5: 'P'
                        6: 'A'
                        7: 'A'
                        8: 'A'
                        9: 'A'

                   So it's "PAAAA" then "PAAAA", but the goal is "PAAAAPAAAA" (which is also 10 letters) -> matches.

            Then we find the goal in the current_string: 
                T = "PAAAA"
                then it's not the whole string? 

            Actually, the current_string is exactly the goal.

            So we output the 4 expansions.

        Sample3: 
            a=7, p=8, S = "PPAAAAAAAAP", E = "PPAP"
            Counts: 
                A_i = 8, P_i=3
                A_g = 1, P_g=3
                Equations:
                  2*x = 1 - 8 + 7*rA = -7 + 7*rA -> nonnegative for rA>=1, and even: 
                      rA=1: -7+7=0 -> x=0.
                      rA=3: -7+21=14 -> x=7, etc. -> we choose rA=1, x=0.
                  2*y = 3-3+8*rP = 8*rP -> y=4*rP. We choose rP=0, then y=0.

                So x=0, y=0, rA=1, rP=0.

            Then we do no expansions.
            T = S = "PPAAAAAAAAP", goal = "PPAP", which is at the beginning? 
                "PPAP" is not at the beginning of "PPAAAAAAAAP", because the beginning is "PP", then a block of 8 A's, then a 'P'. 
                But the goal "PPAP" is not contiguous in T.

            However, we find: 
                T.find(E) -> 
                  "PPAAAAAAAAP": 
                  substring "PPAP": 
                      at index0: "PP" matches, then next should be 'A', but the next is 'A' (at index2) then next should be 'P', but the next after that is not the fourth character? 
                  "PPAAAAAAAAP": 
                      positions: 
                        0: 'P'
                        1: 'P'
                        2: 'A' (and then more A's)
                  we need "PPAP": 
                      at index0: 
                         T[0]='P', T[1]='P', T[2]='A', T[3]='P' -> but T[3] is 'A', not 'P'. 
                  next index1: 
                         T[1]='P', T[2]='A', T[3]='A', T[4]='P' -> matches? 
                  "PPAAAAAAAAP" at index1 to index4: 
                         T[1] to T[4]: "P", "A", "A", "P" -> "PAAP" -> not "PPAP".

            How about the goal "PPAP" is at the very beginning? not in the middle.

            But wait, we can remove the block of A's in the middle. 

            We have rA=1, so we can remove one block of 7 consecutive A's.

            In the string "PPAAAAAAAAP", there is a block of 8 A's. We can remove any consecutive 7 A's within this block.

            If we remove the first 7 A's: 
                starting at index2: remove 7 A's: then the string becomes "PP" + (the last A and the last P) = "PPAP" -> matches.

            So we do one removal: 
                '-A 3'  (1-indexed: the block starts at index3? but the first A is at index2 (0-indexed) -> 0-indexed index2 is the third character? 
                In 1-indexed: the first character is 'P' at1, then 'P' at2, then 'A' at3, then ... 
                So the block of 7 A's starting at the first A: position3.

            Therefore, we do:

                operations = [('-A', 3)]

            So we don't need to do the substring find. We can remove anywhere.

        Therefore, we change the removal phase to: 

          We have to do rA times of op3 and rP times of op4.

          We will do:

             for i in range(rA):
                 find a consecutive block of a 'A's in the current_string (scanning from left to right) and remove it.
                 record the operation.

             for i in range(rP):
                 find a consecutive block of p 'P's in the current_string and remove it.

          But the order might matter. 

          We can do:

             for removal in range(rA + rP):
                 # try remove a block of a A's first if available, then a block of p P's.
                 found = False
                 for start in range(0, len(current_string)-a+1):
                     if current_string[start:start+a] == 'A'*a:
                         # remove this block
                         current_string = current_string[0:start] + current_string[start+a:]
                         operations.append(('-A', start+1))
                         found = True
                         break
                 if not found:
                     for start in range(0, len(current_string)-p+1):
                         if current_string[start:start+p] == 'P'*p:
                             current_string = current_string[0:start] + current_string[start+p:]
                             operations.append(('-P', start+1))
                             found = True
                             break
                 if not found:
                     # cannot do this removal, then we output -1 for the test case.
                     break

             if not found in any removal, then output -1.

          But what if we have to remove rA=2 and there is one block of a A's, then after removal, there is another block of a A's? 

          Example: a=5, and the string is "AAAAAAAA", then we can remove the first 5, then we have "AAA", then we cannot remove the next 5.

          Therefore, we should try to remove from the right:

             for start in range(len(current_string)-a, -1, -1):

          or any order? 

          But the problem does not specify order.

          However, the counts condition ensures that we have exactly the number of A's to remove: A_i + 2*x - a * rA = A_g.

          So the total number of A's in the string after expansions is A_i + 2*x, and we remove rA times of a A's, leaving A_g.

          But the string might have more than a * rA A's? if there are also P's expansions, then there might be more A's from proton expansions.

          Example: if we do op1 on a proton, we add two A's.

          Therefore, the total A's is exactly A_i + 2*x.

          And we are to remove a * rA A's, so the remaining is A_i + 2*x - a * rA = A_g.

          But the string might also have A's that are not removable because they are not consecutive in a block of length a.

          So we must ensure that the a * rA A's are removable in blocks of a.

          This is a well known: we need to know if we can partitioned the extra A's (which are a * rA A's) into segments of exactly a consecutive A's.

          But the A's might be scattered.

          Therefore, we will try to remove any block of a consecutive A's, and hope that after removal, we can remove the next.

          But there might be an order: 
             Example: a=5, and the string is "AAAAA", then we remove it -> done.
             Example: a=5, and the string is "AAAAAP", then the block is at the beginning.
             Example: a=5, and the string is "PAAAA", then the block is at the end.

          But if the string is "AAAPAAA", a=3: 
             then we can remove the first 3: "APAAA" -> then we have a block of 3 at the end? 
             then remove the last 3: "APA" -> but we cannot remove the middle block.

          In our algorithm, we scan from left to right for the first block of a A's. 
          In "AAAPAAA", we find the first block at index0: "AAA", remove it -> leaves "PAAAA" -> then we can remove the block at index1: but wait, "PAAAA": we scan from left: 
             at index0: 'P' -> skip
             index1: 'A', and then we check if there is a block of 3 starting at1: "AAA", so we remove at1 -> leaves "P".

          So it works.

          But if the string is "AAAA", a=3: then we can remove one block of 3 at index0: leaves "A", which is not removable. And we need to remove one more block (rA=2), but we only have one block. -> then the removal phase fails.

          But the counts: 
             total A's to remove = a * rA = 3*2 = 6.
             initial A's after expansion = ? 

          We must have exactly 6 extra A's. 

          Therefore, the string must have at least 6 A's. 

          So if we have only 4 A's, then we have a problem.

          In the example, the counts condition: 
             A_i + 2*x = some number, and we have a * rA = 6, so the initial number of A's must be at least 6.

          So if we have only 4, then the counts wouldn't have a solution.

          Therefore, we are safe.

        So the final algorithm for removal phase is:

          current_string = (after expansions)   # a string (we will use string for easier substring)
          operations_removal = []

          for i in range(rA):
              found = False
              for start in range(0, len(current_string) - a + 1):
                  if current_string[start:start+a] == 'A'*a:
                      # remove this block
                      current_string = current_string[0:start] + current_string[start+a:]
                      operations_removal.append(('-A', start+1))
                      found = True
                      break
              if not found:
                  # try from the end? 
                  for start in range(len(current_string)-a, -1, -1):
                      if current_string[start:start+a] == 'A'*a:
                         current_string = current_string[0:start] + current_string[start+a:]
                         operations_removal.append(('-A', start+1))
                         found = True
                         break
              if not found:
                  # error
                  print("cannot find a block of A's to remove")
                  return -1   for the test case? 
                  # but we have to output -1 for the test case.
                  valid = False
                  break

          if not valid, output -1 for the test case.

          Similarly for rP:
          for i in range(rP):
              found = False
              for start in range(0, len(current_string) - p + 1):
                  if current_string[start:start+p] == 'P'*p:
                      current_string = current_string[0:start] + current_string[start+p:]
                      operations_removal.append(('-P', start+1))
                      found = True
                      break
              if not found:
                  for start in range(len(current_string)-p, -1, -1):
                      if current_string[start:start+p] == 'P'*p:
                         current_string = current_string[0:start] + current_string[start+p:]
                         operations_removal.append(('-P', start+1))
                         found = True
                         break
              if not found:
                  valid = False
                  break

          Then after removal, we must have current_string == E.

          If not, then output -1.

        This is for the removal phase.

        Let's run sample3: 
            after expansion: current_string = "PPAAAAAAAAP" (since no expansion)
            rA=1, a=7.
            We scan for a block of 7 'A's: 
                from start=2: "AAAAAAA" -> matches.
                remove from start=2 (0-indexed), so in 1-indexed start=3.
                operations_removal = [('-A',3)]
                current_string = "PP" + current_string[2+7:] = "PP" + (the last part: from index9) -> which is "AP"? 
                But the string: 
                  0: 'P'
                  1: 'P'
                  2 to 8: "AAAAAAA" (7 characters)
                  9: 'A'? 
                  10: 'P'? 
                Actually, the initial string has length 11: 
                  "PP" (2) + "AAAAAAA" (7) + "AP" (2) -> no, the initial string is "PPAAAAAAAAP", which is 2+8+1 = 11? 
                Let me count: 
                  P,P, then 8 A's, then P -> total 2+8+1=11.

                We remove 7 A's from index2 to index8 (0-indexed indices), then we are left with:
                  [0:2] = "PP"
                  then from index9: the string is "A"? no, index9 is the 10th character? 
                Actually, the removal: 
                  current_string[0:2] + current_string[2+7:] = current_string[0:2] + current_string[9:] 
                current_string[9:] is the substring from index9 to the end: 
                  index9: 'A', index10: 'P'? 
                So we get "PP" + "AP" = "PPAP", which is the goal.

            So it works.

        Sample4: 
            a=8, p=9, S = "PAPPPPPPPPP", E="PPAP"
            Counts: 
                A_i=1, P_i=11
                A_g=1, P_g=3
                Equations:
                  A: 1 + 2*x - 8*rA = 1 -> 2*x = 8*rA -> x=4*rA.
                  P: 11 + 2*y - 9*rP = 3 -> 2*y = 3 - 11 + 9*rP = 9*rP - 8.
                  We need 9*rP - 8 >=0 and even.
                  rP=2: 18-8=10 -> y=5.
                  rP=0: -8, negative -> skip.
                  rP=1: 9-8=1, not even.
                  rP=2: works.

                So x=4*rA, y=5, rA= any nonnegative integer? 
                We have one equation with two free variables.

                We can choose rA=0, then x=0, then we have one solution: x=0, y=5, rA=0, rP=2.

                Or rA=1, then x=4, y=5, rP=2.

                We choose the smallest total operations? or any.

                Let's try rA=0, rP=2, x=0, y=5.

                But we have to do 5 expansions on antiprotons and 2 removals on protons.

                How many antiprotons initially? only one (in "PAPPPPPPPPP").

                But after expansion on an antiproton: 
                    We replace an 'A' with 'P','A','P', so we get one new antiproton (the middle one) and two protons.

                So after one expansion, we still have one 'A' (in the middle) and we can expand it again.

                So we can do 5 expansions on the same A? 

                But initially there is one A. After expanding it, it becomes three particles: 'P','A','P'. The A is still there, so we can expand it again.

                So the number of A's never decreases by expansion.

                Therefore, we can do the 5 expansions.

                Steps for expansion:

                  Start: "PAPPPPPPPPP"

                  Expansion1 on the A (at index1): 
                     becomes: 
                         [0] = 'P'
                         then replace the A at1: 
                             insert 'P' at1, then 'A' at2, then 'P' at3.
                         then the rest: the 9 P's.
                     -> "P" + "P" + "A" + "P" + "PPPPPPPPPP" = "PPAP" + "PPPPPPPPPP"

                  Now the A is at index2.

                  Expansion2 on the A at index2: 
                     replace it with 'P','A','P'
                     -> "PP" + (from the expansion: 'P','A','P') + "P" + "PPPPPPPP" 
                     -> "PP" + "P" then "A" then "P" then "P" and then 8 P's -> "PPPAP" + "P"*9  [but wait, the rest is the 9 P's? no, after the first expansion we had 9 P's, but we used one position for the expansion, so the 9 P's are after the expansion?]

                     Actually, after the first expansion, the string is "PPAP" + 'P'*9 -> length = 4+9=13.
                     Now we expand the A at the third character (0-indexed index2 is the third character, 1-indexed=3) -> 
                         positions: 
                            0: 'P'
                            1: 'P'
                            2: 'A' -> to be expanded.
                         So we break: 
                            [0:2] = "PP"
                            then replace 'A' at2: with 'P','A','P'
                            then the rest: the 'P' that was at3 and the 9 P's: that's 10 P's? 
                         But wait, the first expansion produced:
                             positions0: 'P' (first)
                             position1: 'P' (inserted)
                             position2: 'A'
                             position3: 'P' (inserted)
                             positions4 to 12: the 9 P's -> that's 13 letters.

                         Now we are expanding the A at position2 (0-indexed index2) -> 
                            becomes: 
                                [0:2] = "PP"
                                then at position2: insert 'P', then 'A', then 'P'
                                then the rest: from position3 to the end: 
                                     0-indexed: 
                                        index3: 'P' (the first inserted after the A in the first expansion)
                                        index4 to 12: the 9 P's.
                                so we replace the A at index2: 
                                    new: 
                                        index0: 'P'
                                        index1: 'P'
                                        index2: 'P' (inserted left)
                                        index3: 'A' (the expanded A becomes this)
                                        index4: 'P' (inserted right)
                                        index5: 'P' (from the first expansion's right P)
                                        index6 to 13: the 9 P's.

                         So the string: "PPPAP" + "P"*9  (length=5+9=14)

                  We have to do 5 expansions, so the string will grow.

                Then we do removal: rP=2, remove two blocks of 9 consecutive P's.

                But after 5 expansions, the number of P's = 11 (initial) + 2*5 (from expansions: each expansion on A adds two P's) = 21.
                We remove 2*9 = 18 P's, leaving 3 P's.

                But the goal has one A and three P's? 

                However, the goal is "PPAP", which has 3 P's and 1 A.

                But after 5 expansions, the A's = 1 (initial) + 5 (each expansion adds one A? no: wait, expansion on an A: we replace one A with one A (in the middle) and two P's. So the number of A's remains the same: 1.

                So the final string after expansions and removals should be one A and 21 - 18 = 3 P's.

                But we need the string to be "PPAP", which is 4 letters.

                How to ensure the goal appears? 

                The expansions are done on the A's, which are in the middle, and the removals remove from anywhere.

                We might end up with the A and three P's in any order.

                Therefore, we must do the removals in a way that leaves the goal.

                Given the complexity, and since the sample only does 1 expansion and then one removal, and the sample solution in the problem uses one expansion and then one removal, we choose a solution with minimal total operations.

                In the sample output for the fourth test case: 
                    They did: 
                        2 operations: 
                          +A 2   (expand the A at position2)
                          -P 5   (remove 9 consecutive P's starting at position5)

                How did they achieve with only one expansion? 
                    The counts: 
                       A_i=1, P_i=11
                       A_g=1, P_g=3
                    Equations:
                       A: 1 + 2*x - 8*rA = 1 -> 2*x = 8*rA.
                       P: 11 + 2*y - 9*rP = 3 -> 2*y = 9*rP - 8.

                    They used x=0? or x= something else.

                    In their operations: 
                       one expansion of an A: so y=1.
                       then one removal of P's: so rP=1.

                    Then for A: 2*x = 8*rA -> we have x=0, rA=0? 
                    For P: 2*y = 9*1 - 8 = 1, which is not even -> not integer y.

                    What's the net effect of their operations? 
                       Initial: "PAPPPPPPPPP" 
                       After expanding the A at2: 
                             becomes: "P" + "P" (inserted left) + "A" + "P" (inserted right) + "PPPPPPPPPP" (the 9 P's) 
                             = "PPAP" + "PPPPPPPPPP"  [10 P's, not 9? because they had 9 initially after the expansion?]
                       Then removal of 9 consecutive P's starting at5: 
                             positions0: 'P'
                            1: 'P'
                            2: 'A'
                            3: 'P'
                            4: 'P' (the first of the 10 P's?) 
                            5: to 13: 9 P's? 
                             So if they remove from5 to13, they remove 9 P's, leaving "PPAP" + the first P of the 10 (at index4) -> "PPAP" and then one P -> "PPAPP", not "PPAP".

                    But the sample output says they output 2 operations and the sample input says the fourth test case is "PAPPPPPPPPP" and the goal is "PPAP".

                    How their removal of 9 consecutive P's leaves "PPAP"? 

                    The string after expansion is of length 1+3+9 = 13.

                    They remove 9 consecutive P's starting at position5: 
                         positions1 to4: "PPAP" (positions1,2,3,4) and then positions5 to13 are removed, so the string is positions1 to4: "PPAP".

                    How indexing works in the sample?
                        1-indexed string after expansion: 
                          position1: 'P'
                          position2: 'P' (inserted left of the A)
                          position3: 'A' (the expanded A)
                          position4: 'P' (inserted right of the A)
                          position5 to13: the 9 P's from the initial (which were after the A)

                    So removal from5 to13 (9 positions) leaves positions1 to4: "PPAP".

                Therefore, the count of P's: 
                   Initial: 11
                   After expansion: added two P's (from the expansion) -> 13 P's? 
                   But wait, the expansion: 
                         we start with one A and one P at the beginning and 9 P's at the end? 
                         then we expand the A: 
                             we remove one A and add two P's and one A, so net change: +2 P's and the A remains.
                         So total P's = 1 (initial first) + 9 (initial last) + 2 (added) = 12.
                   Then remove 9 P's -> 3 P's left.

                And the goal has 3 P's? 
                    "PPAP" -> has three P's.

                So the equations:
                  A: 1 + 2*x - a * rA = 1  => 2*x = a * rA.
                  P: 11 + 2*y - p * rP = 3  => 2*y = 3 - 11 + p * rP = p * rP - 8.
                In the sample: 
                  a=8, p=9.
                  x=0, rA=0: then A equation holds.
                  y=1, rP=1: then 2*1 = 9*1 - 8 = 1 -> 2=1? -> not.

                There is a mistake.

                Let me recount the initial and final:

                  S = "PAPPPPPPPPP": 
                    counts: 
                      P: the first letter and then 10 P's? 
                      "P", then "A", then "PPPPPPPPPP" (10 P's) -> total P's=11.

                  After expansion: 
                      we have: 
                         one P (first)
                         then we insert a P (left of A) -> now P's=2
                         then the A (which is not changed in count)
                         then we insert a P (right of A) -> now P's=3
                         then the 10 P's -> now P's=13.

                  Then we remove 9 consecutive P's: we remove 9, leaving 4 P's.

                  But the goal "PPAP" has three P's.

                So the sample output should have 3 P's, but we have 4.

                Let me count the goal: "PPAP" has letters: 
                  P, P, A, P -> three P's.

                In the resulting string after removal: 
                   They removed position5 to13: that's 9 particles.
                   The string is left with positions1 to4: 
                     1: 'P'
                     2: 'P'
                     3: 'A'
                     4: 'P'
                   -> "PPAP", which is three P's? 

                How? position1: 'P', position2: 'P', position3: 'A', position4: 'P' -> that's three P's.

                Why did we count 4? 
                    After expansion: 
                       the string has 1 (first P) + 1 (inserted P) + 1 (inserted P after A) + 10 (the trailing) = 13? 
                       but wait, the expansion: 
                            S = "PAPPPPPPPPP" (length=11)
                            We expand the A at position2 (1-indexed): 
                                new string: 
                                  character1: 'P' (unchanged)
                                  then we insert a P at the left of the A: so character2: 'P'
                                  then the A becomes expanded to: character3: 'A' (but wait, the expansion replaces the A with 'P','A','P'? no, it replaces it with PAP? 
                                The operation: replace the A with "PAP", so we get: 
                                  character1: 'P'
                                  character2: 'P' (inserted left) -> then the A is replaced by 'P','A','P'? 
                                  but then we have: 
                                      [0] = 'P'
                                      [1] = 'P' 
                                      [2] = 'A' is replaced by three: so we get:
                                          [2] = 'P' (from the expansion)
                                          [3] = 'A' 
                                          [4] = 'P'
                                  then the rest: the 10 P's -> so from index5 to index13: the 10 P's? 

                                But wait, the initial string after the first P and the A and the 10 P's: 
                                    positions0: 'P'
                                    positions1: 'A'
                                    positions2: to 11: the 10 P's.

                                When we expand the A at position2 (1-indexed position2, which is the second particle) -> which is the 'A' at index1 (0-indexed).

                                The new string: 
                                    [0:1] = ['P'] 
                                    then we replace the A at index1 (0-indexed) with "PAP", so we get:
                                        [1] = 'P'
                                        [2] = 'A'
                                        [3] = 'P'
                                    then the rest: the 10 P's are at positions2 to 11 (0-indexed) -> now shifted to positions4 to 13.

                                So the new string has length = 1 + 3 + 10 = 14? 
                                   0: 'P'
                                   1: 'P' (inserted)
                                   2: 'A' 
                                   3: 'P' (inserted)
                                   4: to 13: the 10 P's.

                                Then they remove 9 consecutive P's starting at position5 (1-indexed), which is index4 (0-indexed) to index12: 9 characters.

                                The string becomes: 
                                   [0:4] = "P", "P", "A", "P"  -> then the last P from the inserted and one P from the 10 P's? 
                                   Specifically, after removal: 
                                      0: 'P'
                                      1: 'P'
                                      2: 'A'
                                      3: 'P'
                                      4: we remove from index4 to index12: so the character at index13 (the last) is not removed? 
                                   But the removal of 9 consecutive from index4 (0-indexed) to index12: that's indices 4,5,...,12 -> 9 characters.
                                   Then the last character (index13) remains? 

                                So the resulting string would be "PPAP" + one P at the end? 

                How indexing works in the removal: 
                   The removal operation: 
                      '-P 5' means: remove p (9) consecutive protons starting at position5 (1-indexed).

                   In the string after expansion (length=14), the positions are 1 to14.

                   Position1: 'P'
                   Position2: 'P'
                   Position3: 'A'
                   Position4: 'P'
                   Position5: 'P' (the first of the 10 P's)
                   ... 
                   Position14: 'P'

                   They remove from position5 to position13: 9 positions: positions5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13.
                   Then the string becomes: 
                         positions1 to4 and position14: 
                         position1: 'P'
                         position2: 'P'
                         position3: 'A'
                         position4: 'P'
                         position14: 'P'  -> "PPAP" + "P" at the end.

                But the sample output says the goal is "PPAP", so they must have removed the last P as well? 

                Or the removal of 9 consecutive P's at position5 leaves the 10th P? 

                The sample input says: 
                  "8 9 PAPPPPPPPPP PPAP"

                So the removal operation is for 9 consecutive P's, and the string after expansion has 13 P's? 

                But if they remove 9, then 13-9=4, but the goal has only 3.

                Therefore, there is a mistake in the sample solution explanation.

                The sample output for the fourth test case is:

                  2
                  +A 2
                  -P 5

                And the sample input says it is valid.

                After reexamine: 

                  The initial string: "PAPPPPPPPPP" 
                    has 11 characters: 
                     1: 'P'
                     2: 'A'
                     3: to 11: 9 P's.   -> total P's = 1+9=10? or 1 (at1) + 9 (from3 to11) = 10, and one A.

                So P_i=10, not 11.

                The input says: "PAPPPPPPPPP" -> 'P', 'A', then 9 'P's? that's 1+1+9=11 characters.

                Count the P's: 
                  positions: 
                    1: 'P'
                    2: 'A'
                    3: 'P'
                    4: 'P'
                    5: 'P'
                    6: 'P'
                    7: 'P'
                    8: 'P'
                    9: 'P'
                   10: 'P'
                   11: 'P'

                So that's 10 P's.

                Then after expansion: 
                  We have: 
                    1: 'P'
                    then expansion on the A at2: 
                      2: 'P' (inserted left)
                      3: 'A'
                      4: 'P' (inserted right)
                    then positions5 to 13: the 9 P's? -> wait, the initial after the A were 9 P's? 
                    But the initial string has after the A: positions3 to11: 9 P's.

                After expansion, the string becomes: 
                   positions1: 'P'
                   positions2: 'P' (inserted left)
                   positions3: 'A' 
                   positions4: 'P' (inserted right)
                   positions5 to 13: the 9 P's from the initial.

                Total P's: 
                  1 (initial first) + 1 (inserted left) + 1 (inserted right) + 9 = 12.

                Then remove 9 consecutive P's at position5: that's positions5 to13: 9 P's, leaving 
                   positions1: 'P'
                   positions2: 'P'
                   positions3: 'A'
                   positions4: 'P'

                which is "PPAP", and the P's count=3.

                Equations:
                  A_i=1, P_i=10
                  A_g=1, P_g=3
                  A: 1 + 2*x - 8*rA = 1 -> 2*x = 8*rA.
                  P: 10 + 2*y - 9*rP = 3 -> 2*y = 9*rP - 7.
                For the sample: 
                  x=0, rA=0 -> works for A.
                  y=1, rP=1: -> 2*1 = 9-7=2 -> 2=2, works.

                So the counts: x=0, y=1, rA=0, rP=1.

                Therefore, we must have only one expansion (y=1) and one removal (rP=1).

                So the algorithm will do:

                  Step1: y=1: find the rightmost 'A' in "PAPPPPPPPPP": 
                         there is only one 'A', at index1 (0-indexed) -> in 1-indexed position2.
                  Step2: expand it: 
                         current_string = "P" + (insert: 'P','A','P') + "PPPPPPPPP"  (the 9 P's) 
                         -> "PPAP" + "PPPPPPPPP" (9 P's) -> length=4+9=13.

                  Step3: then for removal: rP=1, remove one block of 9 consecutive P's.
                         In the string "PPAPPPPPPPPPP" (13 characters), 
                         we need to find a block of 9 consecutive P's.
                         In the suffix: the last 9 are 'P's. 
                         So we can remove starting at position5 (1-indexed) if the block of 9 is from5 to13? 
                         But the string: 
                             positions1: 'P'
                            2: 'P'
                            3: 'A'
                            4: 'P'
                            5: 'P'
                            6: 'P'
                            7: 'P'
                            8: 'P'
                            9: 'P'
                            10: 'P'
                            11: 'P'
                            12: 'P'
                            13: 'P'  -> wait, that's 10 P's from position4 to13? 

                         Specifically, from position5 to13: that's 9 characters: positions5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13: 'P'*9.

                         So we can remove at start=5 (1-indexed).

                  operations = [ 
                      ('+A', 2),
                      ('-P', 5)
                  ]

                This matches the sample output.

        Therefore, we will do for the fourth test case: 
            solve the equations: 
               for rA in range(0, 20):
                  for rP in range(0, 20):
                     x_val = (A_g - A_i + a * rA) 
                     if x_val % 2 != 0 or x_val<0: skip.
                     x = x_val // 2
                     y_val = (P_g - P_i + p * rP)
                     if y_val % 2 != 0 or y_val<0: skip.
                     y = y_val // 2
                     then we choose the first (rA, rP) in the iteration order.

                But note: we iterate rA from 0 to 20, then rP from0 to 20.

            Then we do the expansions and then the removals as described.

        Let's code accordingly.

        Note: the expansion: 
            When we replace a particle at position i (1-indexed), in 0-indexed at index = i-1.
            We then do: 
                current_string = current_string[0:i-1] + (for op1: ['A','P','A']) + current_string[i:]
            But wait, we are replacing one character with three, so the new string has length increased by 2.

            However, in the code above for expansion, we did for a proton at index (0-indexed) i:
                current_string = current_string[0:i] + ['A','P','A'] + current_string[i+1:]

            This is correct.

        Let's hope it passes.

        We'll code accordingly.

        Note: the problem says the number of operations k must be at most 35000, and our operations are at most (x+y+rA+rP) which is at most (25+25+10+10)=70.

        We'll run it on the sample test cases.

        We'll also include a fallback: if during expansion we don't find the rightmost particle, then we try the leftmost? and if still not found, then we output -1.

        But the counts condition should ensure that there are enough particles.

        Let's code accordingly.

        Due to the complexity and the small constraints, we hope it works.

        Code for one test case:

          t = int(input().strip())
          for _ in range(t):
              data = input().split()
              if not data: continue
              a = int(data[0]); p_val = int(data[1]); S = data[2]; E = data[3]

              # Count particles in S and E
              A_i = S.count('A')
              P_i = S.count('P')
              A_g = E.count('A')
              P_g = E.count('P')

              # Solve the equations for nonnegative integers (x, y, rA, rP)
              solutions = []
              for rA in range(0, 21):
                  temp = A_g - A_i + a * rA
                  if temp < 0 or temp % 2 != 0:
                      continue
                  x = temp // 2
                  for rP in range(0, 21):
                      temp2 = P_g - P_i + p_val * rP
                      if temp2 < 0 or temp2 % 2 != 0:
                          continue
                      y = temp2 // 2
                      solutions.append((x, y, rA, rP))

        However, note: the removal phase may be done in a different order? 
          We did all expansions then all removals, and within removals, we did all A removals then all P removals.

        But the problem allows any order.

        We'll hope it works.

        Given the time, we'll output this solution.

        Note: The above double-check for solutions: we try the first solution, and if it fails during expansion or removal, we try the next solution.

        We iterate solutions in the order we found.

        Let's hope it works for the provided samples.

        We'll run the sample test cases.

        Sample1: 
           a=13, p=10, S="PP", E="PAAAAPAAAA"
           solution: x=4, y=0, rA=0, rP=0.

        Sample2: 
           a=10, p=13, S="AAAAAAA", E="PPPPPPP"  -> 7 A's to 0 A's and 0 P's to 7 P's.
           Equations: 
              2*x = 0-7+10*rA -> 10*rA -7, must be nonnegative and even.
                 rA=1: 3 -> not even.
                 rA=2: 13 -> not even.
                 ... no solution -> -1.

        Sample3: 
           a=7, p=8, S="PPAAAAAAAAP", E="PPAP"
           solution: 
               A_i=8, A_g=1, P_i=3, P_g=3.
               2*x = 1-8+7*rA = 7*rA -7 -> 7(rA-1). Choose rA=1: then 0 -> x=0.
               2*y = 3-3+8*rP = 8*rP -> y=4*rP. Choose rP=0: y=0.
               solution: (0,0,1,0)

        Sample4: 
           a=8, p=9, S="PAPPPPPPPPP", E="PPAP"
           A_i=1, A_g=1, P_i=10, P_g=3.
           2*x = 1-1+8*rA = 8*rA -> x=4*rA.
           2*y = 3-10+9*rP = 9*rP-7. 
               rP=1: 2 -> then y=1 -> valid.
               solution: rA=0, rP=1, x=0, y=1.

        So we'll do.

        Given the complexity, we code accordingly.

        We'll write the code accordingly.

        Note: we must not do an expensive many solutions (we have at most 21*21=441 solutions) and for each solution we simulate expansions and removals. The string length is at most 50 + 2*(x+y) and x,y at most (a solution: x and y can be up to (for example) 20*a? which is 20*20=400? then the string length is 50+2*400=850, and removal has to scan a string of length 850 for blocks, and we do up to 20+20=40 removal operations, and 441 solutions: 441* (expansions: 400? and removals:40*850) -> worst-case 400 + 40*850 = 400+34000=34400 per solution, times 441 -> 34400*441 = 15170400, which is acceptable for 10 test cases? 

        But note: t<=10, and the number of solutions per test case is at most 441, and the simulations per solution might be heavy in the removal if the string is long.

        However, the worst-case solution might have x and y up to 400, then the string length is 850, and we do 40 block removals (each removal we scan the string of length 850 for a block: a scan for a block of a=5 would be 850-5+1 per removal, and 40*850 = 34000) per solution, and 441 solutions: 34000 * 441 = 15,000,000, which is acceptable in Python for 10 test cases? 

        But 10 test cases: 150e6 operations, which might be borderline in Python in 2 seconds.

        Alternatively, we can break out as soon as we find a valid solution.

        We'll hope the first solution is valid.

        We'll try to choose a solution with small x+y+rA+rP to minimize the length.

        How? We can iterate rA and rP from 0 to 20, and we pick the first solution (which is the smallest rA and then smallest rP) and hope it works.

        Or we can sort the solutions by the total operations (x+y+rA+rP) and try the smallest first.

        But the expansion operations are more expensive in terms of string length, so we want small x+y.

        We can generate the list of solutions and then sort by (x+y+rA+rP) and then try in increasing order.

        We'll do:

          solutions = []
          for rA in range(0,21):
             ...
             for rP in range(0,21):
                 ...
                 solutions.append( (x+y+rA+rP, x, y, rA, rP) )

          then sort solutions by the first element.

          Then for the sorted solutions (from smallest total operations to largest), try until one works.

        This might find a valid solution faster.

        Let's do that.

        Final code structure for one test case:

          # ... (counts)

          solutions = []
          for rA in range(0,21):
            for rP in range(0,21):
               ...  # check if x and y are integers and nonnegative
               if valid_counts:
                  solutions.append( (x+y+rA+rP, x, y, rA, rP) )

          if not solutions: 
             print(-1)
             continue

          solutions_sorted = sorted(solutions, key=lambda z: z[0])

          found = False
          for total_ops, x, y, rA, rP in solutions_sorted:
              # try this solution
              current_string = list(S)
              operations = []
              valid = True
              # do x expansions on protons
              for _ in range(x):
                 # find the rightmost 'P', if not, then try leftmost, if not, valid=False and break
                 ... 
              if not valid:
                 continue
              for _ in range(y):
                 ... 
              if not valid:
                 continue

              current_str = ''.join(current_string)
              temp_operations = []
              # do rA removals for A and then rP removals for P
              # (or we can do interleaved, but we do A then P)
              # do A removals
              for _ in range(rA):
                 ... # scan for a block of a 'A's
              if not valid:
                 continue
              for _ in range(rP):
                 ... 
              if not valid:
                 continue

              if current_str == E:
                 operations += temp_operations
                 # output the operations
                 found = True
                 break

          if found:
             print(len(operations))
             for op in operations:
                 if op[0] in ['+P', '+A']:
                     print(op[0] + " " + str(op[1]))
                 else:
                     print(op[0] + " " + str(op[1]))
          else:
             print(-1)

        We hope this passes.

        Let's run the fourth sample with this structure.

        We'll now code accordingly.

        Note: We must be cautious about the string being long and the removal scanning.

        But the total operations is small, and the string length is at most 50+2*(x+y) <= 50+2*(some hundreds) which is acceptable.

        Let's code accordingly.
