### Understanding the Problem
Trillian wants to assemble an \( r \times c \) grid of bánh bò hấp pieces (each either red or white) such that every \( 6 \times 7 \) contiguous subgrid has the same number of red pieces. Given that \( r \) is a multiple of 6 and \( c \) is a multiple of 7, the task is to count the number of such uniform assemblies modulo 998244353.

### Key Insight
The uniformity condition requires that every \( 6 \times 7 \) subgrid has the same number of red pieces. This condition implies that the entire grid must be composed of identical \( 6 \times 7 \) blocks. Specifically:
- The grid can be divided into \(\frac{r}{6} \times \frac{c}{7}\) blocks, each of size \( 6 \times 7 \).
- For the grid to be uniform, all these blocks must be identical. This is because any \( 6 \times 7 \) subgrid, whether aligned with the blocks or overlapping multiple blocks, must have the same number of red pieces. The only way to ensure this is if every block is the same.

### Why Identical Blocks?
1. **Aligned Subgrids**: Consider a \( 6 \times 7 \) subgrid that aligns perfectly with one block. The number of red pieces in this subgrid is the sum of red pieces in that block.
2. **Overlapping Subgrids**: For a subgrid that overlaps multiple blocks, the uniformity condition forces the sums of the overlapping blocks to be consistent. The only way to satisfy this for all possible overlapping subgrids is if all blocks are identical.

Thus, the entire grid is determined by a single \( 6 \times 7 \) block, repeated \(\frac{r}{6}\) times vertically and \(\frac{c}{7}\) times horizontally.

### Counting Valid Grids
- Each cell in the base \( 6 \times 7 \) block can be either red or white, giving \( 2^{42} \) possible blocks.
- Since the entire grid is formed by repeating this base block, the total number of uniform grids is \( 2^{42 \times a \times b} \), where \( a = \frac{r}{6} \) and \( b = \frac{c}{7} \).

### Modular Exponentiation
Given the constraints (\( r \leq 66,666 \) and \( c \leq 77,777 \)), the exponent \( 42 \times a \times b \) can be as large as \( 42 \times 11111 \times 11111 = 5,185,081,482 \). We compute \( 2^{\text{exponent}} \mod 998244353 \) efficiently using modular exponentiation (e.g., with Python's built-in `pow(base, exponent, modulus)` or a fast exponentiation algorithm in C++).

### Solution Code
The solution involves:
1. Reading \( r \) and \( c \).
2. Calculating \( a = r // 6 \) and \( b = c // 7 \).
3. Computing the exponent as \( \text{exponent} = 42 \times a \times b \).
4. Calculating \( 2^{\text{exponent}} \mod 998244353 \) using fast exponentiation.

### Example Calculations
- **Sample Input 1**: \( r = 6, c = 7 \).  
  \( a = 1, b = 1 \), exponent = 42.  
  \( 2^{42} \mod 998244353 = 780136139 \).
- **Sample Input 2**: \( r = 12, c = 14 \).  
  \( a = 2, b = 2 \), exponent = 168.  
  \( 2^{168} \mod 998244353 = 22889737 \).
- **Sample Input 3**: \( r = 12, c = 42 \).  
  \( a = 2, b = 6 \), exponent = 504.  
  \( 2^{504} \mod 998244353 = 96403614 \).
- **Sample Input 4**: \( r = 42, c = 14 \).  
  \( a = 7, b = 2 \), exponent = 588.  
  \( 2^{588} \mod 998244353 = 94940316 \).

### Complexity
The algorithm runs in \( O(\log(\text{exponent})) \) time due to the modular exponentiation step, which is efficient even for the upper limits of the input.

### Why This Works
- **Correctness**: The uniformity condition is satisfied because every \( 6 \times 7 \) subgrid is either a copy of the base block or a combination of parts of identical blocks, ensuring the same number of red pieces.
- **Completeness**: Any grid satisfying the uniformity condition must be composed of identical \( 6 \times 7 \) blocks, as derived from the necessary conditions for overlapping subgrids.

This approach efficiently counts all valid grids by leveraging the repetition of a base block and using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers.
