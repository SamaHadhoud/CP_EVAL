 Okay, let me try to understand the problem and figure out the solution.

 We are given an array `a[1..n]` and we start with an array `b` of all zeros. In one operation, we choose two indices i and j, and then:
   b_i becomes b_i XOR (a_i XOR a_j)
   b_j becomes b_j XOR (a_i XOR a_j)

 Notice that the value (a_i XOR a_j) is the same for both. Let d = a_i XOR a_j.

 So, after the operation:
   b_i' = b_i XOR d
   b_j' = b_j XOR d

 Also note that the entire operation is simultaneous.

 We can write the entire transformation as:

   (b_i, b_j) -> (b_i XOR d, b_j XOR d)

 But note that d = a_i XOR a_j.

 What are the invariants? How do these operations affect the entire sequence?

 Let's analyze what happens to the entire vector B.

 Consider the effect of one operation on two positions (i, j). The other positions remain unchanged.

 Notice that the XOR of the entire vector B (all b's) is initially 0. What happens to the total XOR?
   Before: total XOR = T
   After: T becomes T XOR d XOR d = T. So the total XOR remains 0.

 Therefore, after any number of operations, the entire vector B must always XOR to 0.

 But is that the only invariant? Let's look at the sample: n=3, a = [1,2,1]. The possible B's are:
   (0,0,0), (3,3,0), (3,0,3), (0,3,3) -> all have total XOR 0.

 However, note that the problem also involves the array `a`. The operations are defined using `a_i` and `a_j`.

 Another perspective: we can define for each index i, the value we are going to assign to it might be built from a set of "differences".

 Alternatively, we can think in terms of linear algebra over GF(2). However, note that the operations are defined in a coupled way.

 Let me try to model the operations:

 We can think that each operation on (i,j) adds the same vector to two positions. Specifically, we are adding the vector that has:
   zeros everywhere except at positions i and j, and at these positions we add the value (a_i XOR a_j).

 But note: the value added at i and j is the same? Actually, no: we are adding d at i and d at j? Actually, the operation does:

   b_i becomes b_i XOR d
   b_j becomes b_j XOR d

 So the vector we are adding is: 
   v_{i,j} = (0,0,...,d,...,d,...,0)  [d at positions i and j]

 But note: d = a_i XOR a_j.

 Now, what is the set of vectors we can add? We are allowed to add any linear combination (over GF(2)) of the vectors v_{i,j} for all pairs (i,j). However, note that the operations can be applied arbitrarily many times and in any order, and we are working modulo GF(2) (so each vector can be added either 0 or 1 times).

 So the set of all achievable B vectors is the linear subspace generated by the vectors { v_{i,j} } for all pairs (i,j).

 But note: the set of pairs is huge (n choose 2). We need to find the dimension of the space spanned by these vectors? Then the number of distinct B would be 2^(dimension). However, we must not forget that we start at the zero vector, so each element in the subspace is achievable.

 But wait: the problem says "zero or more operations", and we can do any number. Also, each operation is additive? Actually, note that adding the same vector twice cancels out because in GF(2) we have 1+1=0. So indeed the set of achievable B is a linear subspace.

 However, we have two issues:

 1. The total XOR of B must be 0? Actually, we saw that the entire vector B must XOR to 0. So we are constrained to the subspace of vectors B such that the XOR of all components is 0. But note: our generators v_{i,j} have two nonzero components (each being d), so the XOR of the entire vector v_{i,j} is d XOR d = 0. Therefore, the entire subspace generated lies in the hyperplane of vectors with total XOR 0.

 2. How to compute the dimension of the subspace spanned by the vectors { v_{i,j} }? 

 But note: the vector v_{i,j} is defined as:
   v_{i,j}[k] = 
        d = a_i XOR a_j   if k = i or k = j
        0                 otherwise.

 Alternatively, we can write:
   v_{i,j} = (a_i XOR a_j) * (e_i + e_j)

 where e_i is the standard basis vector (which is 1 at position i and 0 elsewhere).

 Now, note that (a_i XOR a_j) is a scalar in GF(2) but actually it is an integer. However, we are working in GF(2) for each bit? Actually, the operations are bitwise and independent per bit? But wait: the vectors we are adding are vectors of integers. However, the problem is linear over GF(2) for each bit independently? 

 Actually, the entire operation is linear over GF(2) if we break each integer into bits. But the problem is that the scalars (a_i XOR a_j) are also vectors of bits. How do we combine?

 Alternatively, we can consider the entire vector space over GF(2) of dimension 30 * n? But that is too high.

 We need a more abstract representation.

 Insight: note that each vector v_{i,j} is of the form:
   (0, ..., a_i XOR a_j, ..., a_i XOR a_j, ..., 0)

 How can we express this as a linear combination of simpler vectors?

 Consider defining a new vector for each edge (i,j) and for each bit? That is too expensive.

 Alternatively, we can try to relate the generators to the array a.

 Another approach:

 Let x_i = b_i. Then the condition of the entire process is that we can add to any pair (i,j) the value (a_i XOR a_j) at both positions.

 Now, we can define the following transformation:

   Consider the differences: what relations must hold for the vector x = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) to be achievable?

 We note:

   The operations preserve:
      x_1 XOR x_2 XOR ... XOR x_n = 0.

   And we can also look for linear relations.

 But note: the operations can be decomposed. Actually, we can rewrite the operation as:

   (x_i, x_j) -> (x_i XOR (a_i XOR a_j), x_j XOR (a_i XOR a_j))

 Now, consider the effect on the value (x_i XOR a_i) and (x_j XOR a_j):

   Let y_i = x_i XOR a_i.

   Then after the operation on (i,j):
        y_i' = (x_i XOR (a_i XOR a_j)) XOR a_i = x_i XOR a_j = (y_i XOR a_i) XOR a_j = y_i XOR (a_i XOR a_j)
        similarly, y_j' = (x_j XOR (a_i XOR a_j)) XOR a_j = x_j XOR a_i = (y_j XOR a_j) XOR a_i = y_j XOR (a_i XOR a_j)

   So we have:
        (y_i, y_j) -> (y_i XOR d, y_j XOR d)   where d = a_i XOR a_j.

   But note: this is the same form as the original operation on x, except that we defined y_i = x_i XOR a_i.

   Alternatively, we can shift the problem by defining y_i = x_i XOR a_i.

   Then the entire vector y starts at (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). And an operation on (i,j) does:

        y_i' = y_i XOR (a_i XOR a_j)
        y_j' = y_j XOR (a_i XOR a_j)

   And then we have: x_i = y_i XOR a_i.

   Now, note that the operation on y is symmetric: we are adding the same value (a_i XOR a_j) to both y_i and y_j.

   Also, what is the effect on the entire vector y? The XOR-sum of y changes from T to T XOR (a_i XOR a_j) XOR (a_i XOR a_j) = T. So the XOR-sum of y is invariant.

   Therefore, the XOR-sum of y must be the same as the initial value, which is a_1 XOR a_2 XOR ... XOR a_n.

   Moreover, we can also consider the differences between y_i and y_j? Actually, note:

        y_i XOR y_j = (x_i XOR a_i) XOR (x_j XOR a_j) = (x_i XOR x_j) XOR (a_i XOR a_j)

        After the operation: 
             (y_i XOR d) XOR (y_j XOR d) = y_i XOR y_j   -> remains the same.

   So the differences y_i XOR y_j are invariant for every pair? Actually, for every pair (i,j) the value y_i XOR y_j is invariant? 

   But wait: we are adding the same value to both y_i and y_j, so the difference y_i - y_j in GF(2) is the same? Actually, in GF(2) adding the same value to two variables does not change their XOR: 
        (y_i XOR d) XOR (y_j XOR d) = y_i XOR y_j.

   Therefore, the value of y_i XOR y_j is invariant for every pair (i,j). 

   However, we don't need every pair: we can note that the entire vector y is determined by any one coordinate and the differences? Actually, if we fix one coordinate, say y_1, then we have:
        y_i = y_1 XOR (y_1 XOR y_i) = y_1 XOR (initial y_1 XOR y_i)   [because y_1 XOR y_i is invariant]

   But note: the initial value of y_i is a_i. So the initial value of y_1 XOR y_i is a_1 XOR a_i.

   Then at any time, we have:
        y_i = y_1 XOR (a_1 XOR a_i)

   Therefore, the entire vector y is determined by y_1.

   And the invariant on the XOR-sum: 
        Let S = a_1 XOR a_2 XOR ... XOR a_n = initial XOR of y.

        Then at any time, we have:
             y_1 XOR (y_1 XOR (a_1 XOR a_2)) XOR ... ??? 

        Actually, we can compute the entire vector y:

             y_1 = some value, say c.
             y_i = c XOR (a_1 XOR a_i)   for each i.

        Then the XOR-sum of y is:
             y_1 XOR y_2 XOR ... XOR y_n = c XOR [c XOR (a_1 XOR a_2)] XOR [c XOR (a_1 XOR a_3)] ... 

        How many times does c appear? It appears n times? Then the XOR-sum becomes:
             c XOR c XOR ... XOR c (n times) XOR (a_1 XOR a_2) XOR (a_1 XOR a_3) XOR ... 

        But note: in GF(2), the XOR of n copies of c is:
             c repeated n times: 
                 if n is even -> 0
                 if n is odd -> c

        Also, the other terms: for each i>=2, we have (a_1 XOR a_i). And note that a_1 appears n-1 times? Actually, we have:

             (a_1 XOR a_2) XOR (a_1 XOR a_3) XOR ... XOR (a_1 XOR a_n) 
                 = (a_1 repeated n-1 times) XOR (a_2 XOR a_3 XOR ... XOR a_n)

        But then: 
             (a_1 repeated n-1 times) = 
                 if n-1 is even -> 0, if odd -> a_1

        And the rest is the XOR of a_2 to a_n.

        Alternatively, we can write the entire expression as:

             = (n-1 mod 2) * a_1 XOR (a_2 XOR ... XOR a_n)

        And note that the initial XOR-sum S = a_1 XOR a_2 XOR ... XOR a_n.

        Then the XOR-sum of y becomes:
             (n mod 2)*c XOR [ (n-1 mod 2)*a_1 XOR (a_2 XOR ... XOR a_n) ]

        But we know that the XOR-sum of y must be S = a_1 XOR ... XOR a_n.

        Therefore, we have:

             (n mod 2)*c XOR [ (n-1 mod 2)*a_1 XOR (a_2 XOR ... XOR a_n) ] = a_1 XOR ... XOR a_n

        Let T = a_2 XOR ... XOR a_n, so S = a_1 XOR T.

        Then:

             (n mod 2)*c XOR [ (n-1 mod 2)*a_1 XOR T ] = a_1 XOR T

        => (n mod 2)*c = [a_1 XOR T] XOR [ (n-1 mod 2)*a_1 XOR T ]
                        = a_1 XOR T XOR ( (n-1 mod 2)*a_1 ) XOR T
                        = a_1 * ( 1 XOR (n-1 mod 2) )   [since T XOR T = 0]

        Now, note: 
            If n is even: then n mod 2 = 0 -> then the left side is 0, so we require:
                 0 = a_1 * (1 XOR (n-1 mod 2)) 
                 but n-1 is odd -> 1, so 1 XOR 1 = 0 -> 0 = 0 -> always true? Then c can be arbitrary?

            But wait: if n is even, then the condition becomes 0 = 0, which is always true. However, we have to be cautious.

        Actually, let's break it:

          n mod 2 = 0 -> then the equation is: 
                 0 = a_1 * (1 XOR (1))   because n-1 mod 2 = 1 -> 1 XOR 1 = 0 -> so 0=0 -> always true.

          n mod 2 = 1 -> then the equation is:
                 c = a_1 * (1 XOR (0))   because n-1 mod 2=0 -> 1 XOR 0 = 1 -> so c = a_1.

        So:

          If n is odd, then we must have c = a_1. Therefore, y_1 is fixed to a_1, so the entire vector y is fixed to the initial one.

          If n is even, then c can be arbitrary? But then we have to account for the operations we can do: how many degrees of freedom?

        However, note: we have not considered the operations. The above derivation is based on the invariant and the fact that the entire vector y is determined by y_1. But what constraints do the operations impose?

        Actually, the operations allow us to change y_1 arbitrarily? But wait: the operations add vectors that are generated by the edges. How does that relate to y_1?

        Let me reexamine: we have the representation:

            y_i = y_1 XOR (a_1 XOR a_i)

        And the XOR-sum condition forces:

            If n is odd: y_1 must be a_1 -> then the vector y is uniquely determined (the initial one). Then the vector x is uniquely determined: x_i = y_i XOR a_i = (a_1 XOR a_i) XOR a_i = a_1? -> no, wait:

                y_i = a_1 XOR (a_1 XOR a_i) = a_i? 
                Then x_i = y_i XOR a_i = a_i XOR a_i = 0. 

            But that is the starting point? How do we get non-zero x?

        I think I made a mistake: the initial state is:
            x_i = 0 for all i -> so y_i = 0 XOR a_i = a_i.

        Then after an operation, we are changing y_i and y_j by adding (a_i XOR a_j). So we are not free to set y_1 arbitrarily? We are constrained to the linear combinations of the generators.

        Actually, the above derivation using the invariant (that y_i XOR y_j is constant) is only valid if the entire graph is connected? 

        Let me think: the invariant y_i XOR y_j is constant? Actually, we saw that for any two indices i and j, the value y_i XOR y_j is invariant? 

        But note: we can only connect two indices if we perform an operation on them? However, we can do a sequence of operations. For example, if we do an operation on (1,2) and then on (2,3), then the values y_1 and y_3 are connected by the chain: 
            y_1 and y_2: y_1 XOR y_2 = constant (initial constant) -> which is a_1 XOR a_2.
            y_2 and y_3: y_2 XOR y_3 = constant (initial constant) -> which is a_2 XOR a_3.

        Then y_1 XOR y_3 = (y_1 XOR y_2) XOR (y_2 XOR y_3) = (a_1 XOR a_2) XOR (a_2 XOR a_3) = a_1 XOR a_3.

        So indeed, the entire graph is connected? Actually, we can connect any two nodes via a chain of operations. Therefore, the differences y_i XOR y_j are preserved for every pair? 

        But note: if we start with an initial vector y = (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n), then for any two indices i and j, we have:
            y_i XOR y_j = a_i XOR a_j.

        And after any sequence of operations, we must still have:
            y_i XOR y_j = a_i XOR a_j   for every pair (i,j).

        Therefore, the entire vector y is forced: y_i = a_i for all i? 

        Then the vector x is forced to be 0? That contradicts the sample.

        What went wrong?

        Let me reexamine the operation on the y vector:

          Operation on (i,j): 
               y_i becomes y_i XOR (a_i XOR a_j)
               y_j becomes y_j XOR (a_i XOR a_j)

          Then the new y_i XOR y_j = (y_i XOR (a_i XOR a_j)) XOR (y_j XOR (a_i XOR a_j)) = y_i XOR y_j.

          So the pairwise XOR is preserved. Therefore, if we start with y_i = a_i for all i, then we have y_i XOR y_j = a_i XOR a_j at the start and at every step. 

          How can we get non-initial states?

          Consider: initially, y_1 = a_1, y_2 = a_2, then after an operation on (1,2):
               y_1' = a_1 XOR (a_1 XOR a_2) = a_2
               y_2' = a_2 XOR (a_1 XOR a_2) = a_1

          Now, check: y_1' XOR y_2' = a_2 XOR a_1 = a_1 XOR a_2 -> same as before.

          But note: the entire vector y is now (a_2, a_1, a_3, ..., a_n). 

          How is the pairwise XOR preserved? Actually, for any other pair involving 1 and 3: 
               y_1' XOR y_3 = a_2 XOR a_3 = (a_1 XOR a_3) XOR (a_1 XOR a_2) ? 
          Not necessarily. 

          But wait: the initial pairwise XOR for (1,3) was a_1 XOR a_3. Now, we have a_2 XOR a_3. In the sample: n=3, a=[1,2,1]. 
          Initially: 
               y_1=1, y_2=2, y_3=1 -> then y_1 XOR y_3 = 0.
          After swapping the first two: 
               y_1=2, y_2=1, y_3=1 -> then y_1 XOR y_3 = 2 XOR 1 = 3? But 0 != 3 -> so what?

          Actually, we must have: initially, for the pair (1,3): 1 XOR 1 = 0. After the operation on (1,2), we have y_1=2, y_3=1 -> 2 XOR 1 = 3. But 3 != 0 -> so the invariant is broken?

        Correction: the invariant is for the entire vector? Actually, the pairwise XOR is not an invariant for every pair? 

        Let me check the operation: 
          Operation on (i,j): 
             Only changes y_i and y_j. For a pair (i,k) where k != j, the value y_i changes to y_i XOR d, and y_k remains the same, so y_i XOR y_k becomes (y_i XOR d) XOR y_k = (y_i XOR y_k) XOR d.

          But d = a_i XOR a_j, which is not necessarily related to a_i XOR a_k? 

          Therefore, the pairwise XOR is not preserved for arbitrary pairs. Only for pairs that are operated together? 

        But then what is preserved?

        We know that the entire XOR-sum is preserved. And we also know that the operation adds a vector that is in the space generated by the vectors of the form (0,...,d,...,d,...,0).

        How to characterize the achievable vectors y?

        Since the operations are linear over GF(2) (each bit independently), we can break the problem into bits. However, note that the scalar d might have multiple bits, but the operation is defined on the entire integer. But the problem is that the generators are not independent per bit? Actually, the generators are linear combinations of the basis vectors per bit? 

        Alternatively, we can consider the vector space of the entire vector y over GF(2)^(30). But the dimension might be high.

        However, note that we have the constraint that the entire vector y must satisfy that the XOR-sum is the initial S (which is known). And we are allowed to add any vector in the linear span of the vectors:

            v_{i,j} = (0,..., d_ij, ..., d_ij, ...0)   [with d_ij at positions i and j]

        where d_ij = a_i XOR a_j.

        But note: d_ij = a_i XOR a_j = (a_i) + (a_j) in GF(2)^30? Actually, it's the vector difference.

        How to compute the linear span of these vectors? 

        We can write: 
            v_{i,j} = (a_i XOR a_j) * (e_i + e_j)

        But note: (a_i XOR a_j) is a scalar in GF(2)^30? Actually, it is a vector of bits. We can represent the entire vector space as a vector space over GF(2) of dimension 30 * n? Then the generators are vectors in that space. But n can be up to 200000, and 30 * 200000 is 6e6, which might be acceptable? But the number of generators is n*(n-1)/2 which is too many.

        We need to find the dimension without enumerating all pairs.

        Insight: note that the set of vectors v_{i,j} is the same as the set of vectors:

            (a_i * (e_i + e_j)) + (a_j * (e_i + e_j))   [but note: in GF(2), multiplication by a vector is componentwise?]

        Actually, we can write:

            v_{i,j} = (a_i + a_j) * (e_i + e_j)   ??? Not exactly: because (a_i XOR a_j) is the same as a_i + a_j in GF(2).

        But note: the vector v_{i,j} is not linear in a_i and a_j? Actually, we have:

            v_{i,j} = (a_i + a_j) * (e_i + e_j)   [in GF(2)^30, but note: the vector e_i is a vector of length n (over GF(2)^30) with the identity vector at position i? Actually, we are representing the vector in (GF(2)^30)^n, so each coordinate is a 30-bit vector.

        Alternatively, we can consider the vector space over GF(2) of dimension n * 30. Then we can write:

            v_{i,j} has zeros everywhere except at positions i and j. At position i, we have the vector a_i XOR a_j (which is the same as a_i + a_j in GF(2)^30) and at position j we have the same.

        How can we find a basis for the span of these vectors?

        Another idea: we can try to express the generators in terms of simpler generators.

        Consider: 
            v_{i,j} = (a_i * e_i + a_i * e_j) + (a_j * e_i + a_j * e_j)   [but note: in GF(2), multiplication by a_i is by a vector?]

        Actually, we can break the problem per bit? But note: the value a_i is a vector of 30 bits. Then we can consider the vector space over GF(2) of dimension n, and then the generators for each bit.

        However, the generators are coupled: the same pair (i,j) gives a vector that has a 1 in the k-th bit at positions i and j only if the k-th bit of (a_i XOR a_j) is 1.

        How about we break into bits? For each bit position b (0<=b<30), we can define a vector over GF(2) of length n:

            For a pair (i,j), the generator for bit b would be: 
                 at positions i and j: we put the bit value of (a_i XOR a_j) at bit b.

            But note: the bit value of (a_i XOR a_j) at bit b is (a_i[b] XOR a_j[b]). Then we can write:

                 w_{i,j,b} = (a_i[b] XOR a_j[b]) * (e_i + e_j)   [this is a vector in GF(2)^n]

        Then the entire vector v_{i,j} is the concatenation over the 30 bits of the vectors w_{i,j,b} for b=0..29.

        Therefore, the space of achievable vectors y (shifted) is the direct sum over the 30 bits of the spaces generated by the vectors { w_{i,j,b} for all pairs (i,j) } for each bit b.

        And the entire space is then the product of the dimensions for each bit? Actually, no: because the generators for different bits are independent? 

        So we can compute the dimension for one bit and then multiply the dimensions? Actually, no: the entire space is the direct sum, so the dimension is the sum of the dimensions per bit? But then we have 30 independent subspaces? 

        However, note: the problem is that the same pair (i,j) gives a vector that is nonzero in multiple bits? But we are breaking the pair into 30 vectors, one per bit. And the operations are independent per bit? 

        Actually, the operation on a pair (i,j) in the original problem affects all bits simultaneously. But when we break into bits, we can consider that we are allowed to choose independently for each bit whether to apply the operation for that bit? 

        However, the operation is applied as a whole: we do an operation on (i,j) and we flip the entire integer at i and j by d. But if we break d into bits, we are flipping each bit of d at positions i and j. And flipping a bit is a linear operation in GF(2).

        But note: we are allowed to do any number of operations and any pairs. And the operations are additive. Therefore, the set of achievable vectors in the entire space is the direct sum of the sets for each bit? 

        Why? Because the generators are separable per bit: the vector for a pair (i,j) is the concatenation of the vectors for each bit. And since the bits are independent, the entire space is the direct product of the spaces for each bit. And then the dimension is the sum of the dimensions per bit.

        Therefore, we can solve the problem independently for each bit.

        Now, for a fixed bit b, what is the space generated by the vectors:

            w_{i,j,b} = (a_i[b] XOR a_j[b]) * (e_i + e_j)

        for all pairs (i,j)?

        But note: (a_i[b] XOR a_j[b]) is either 0 or 1. If it is 0, then the vector is 0 and we can ignore. So we only consider pairs (i,j) such that a_i[b] != a_j[b].

        What does the vector w_{i,j,b} look like?
            If a_i[b] and a_j[b] are different, then we have:
                 w_{i,j,b} = e_i + e_j   (in GF(2)^n)

            Otherwise, w_{i,j,b} = 0.

        Therefore, for a fixed bit b, the space we are generating is the space generated by the vectors e_i+e_j for all pairs (i,j) such that a_i[b] != a_j[b]. 

        But note: the entire space generated by { e_i+e_j } for any pairs is the same as the cut space of the graph? Actually, we know that the vectors e_i+e_j for edges in a graph span the space of vectors that are 0 on the entire XOR-sum? Actually, the space generated by the edge vectors in a graph is the space of vectors with an even number of ones? Not exactly: in GF(2), the space generated by the incidence vectors of edges (if we consider an edge as a vector with two ones) is the space of vectors that are orthogonal to the all-ones vector? Actually, the sum of the vector is the sum over the ones. The sum of the vector e_i+e_j is 0 mod 2. So the entire space is contained in the hyperplane of vectors with even parity.

        Moreover, if the graph is connected, then the dimension is n-1. In general, the dimension is n - c, where c is the number of connected components.

        Therefore, for a fixed bit b, consider the graph G_b where we put an edge between i and j if a_i[b] != a_j[b]. But note: an edge is present only if the b-th bit of a_i is different from the b-th bit of a_j.

        Alternatively, we can partition the indices by the value of a_i[b]: let S_b = { i : a_i[b] = 1 } and T_b = { i : a_i[b] = 0 }.

        Then an edge (i,j) is present only if one endpoint is in S_b and the other in T_b. Therefore, the graph G_b is a complete bipartite graph between S_b and T_b.

        How many connected components does this graph have? 
          Actually, if both S_b and T_b are nonempty, then the graph is connected? Because any two nodes in S_b are not directly connected, but they are both connected to every node in T_b, so the entire graph is connected. 
          If one of S_b or T_b is empty, then there is no edge? Then the graph has n connected components.

        Therefore, the dimension for the bit b is:
          If the graph has no edge (i.e., S_b is empty or T_b is empty) then the space is trivial (dimension 0).
          Otherwise, the graph is connected -> dimension = n - 1.

        But note: we also have the constraint that the entire vector must have an even number of ones? Actually, the space we generate is contained in the hyperplane of vectors with even parity? And when the graph is connected, we get the entire hyperplane? 

        Actually, the space generated by the vectors e_i+e_j for a connected graph is the entire hyperplane of vectors with an even sum? The dimension is n-1? 

        Therefore, for each bit b:
          Let c_b = number of connected components of G_b -> then the dimension of the space for bit b is (n - c_b). But note: in the connected case (c_b=1) we get n-1, and if the graph is disconnected (with no edge) then c_b = n -> dimension = n - n = 0.

        Actually, in general, for a graph with c connected components, the dimension of the cycle space? Actually, the space generated by the edge vectors is the space of vectors that are constant on connected components and have even total sum? 

        But here, our generators are the edge vectors of the complete bipartite graph. The connected components of the graph G_b are: 
          If there is at least one edge, then the graph is connected -> c_b=1? 
          If there is no edge, then c_b = n? 

        Actually, the graph G_b is bipartite and complete between S_b and T_b. Then:
          If both S_b and T_b are nonempty -> connected -> c_b=1.
          If either S_b or T_b is empty -> then there are no edges, and the connected components are each vertex by itself -> c_b = n.

        Therefore, the dimension for bit b is:
          dim_b = n - c_b = 
                   n - 1   if the graph is connected (i.e., both S_b and T_b are nonempty)
                   0        if the graph is disconnected (i.e., all nodes have the same bit b)

        Then the total dimension for the entire vector space (over GF(2)) is:

            dim = sum_{b=0}^{29} dim_b = sum_{b: the b-th bit is not constant} (n-1)

        But wait: we have 30 bits. However, note that the entire vector space is over GF(2)^(30*n). And we are generating a subspace that is the direct sum of the subspaces for each bit? 

        Therefore, the total dimension is the sum of the dimensions per bit.

        However, we must remember that we have a global constraint: the entire vector y must have XOR-sum = S (the initial one). But note: our operations preserve the XOR-sum? Yes, as we saw. Therefore, the entire space we generated lies in the hyperplane defined by the XOR-sum = S. 

        But wait: the initial vector y is the vector a, which has XOR-sum S. And our operations add vectors that have even parity in each bit? Actually, the vector w_{i,j,b} has two ones? So the entire vector we add has even parity in each bit? Therefore, the XOR-sum of the entire vector (over all n) is preserved? 

        Actually, for each bit b, the vector we add for that bit has an even number of ones? Because it has 2 ones? So the XOR-sum (which is the parity) for that bit is preserved. Therefore, the condition that the XOR-sum is S is automatically satisfied by the entire subspace we generated? 

        How? The initial vector y = a satisfies the condition. And we only add vectors that have even parity (so the parity of the entire vector for each bit remains the same). Therefore, the entire generated space lies in the hyperplane of vectors with XOR-sum = S.

        And note: the hyperplane of vectors with a fixed XOR-sum S has dimension (n * 30 - 1)? Actually, the condition for each bit is independent? The condition for the entire vector is that the XOR over the n positions for each bit is the same as the corresponding bit in S. 

        But our subspace is contained in that hyperplane? Actually, we have:

          The initial vector is in the hyperplane and the generators are orthogonal to the hyperplane (because the generators have even parity per bit, so they are in the hyperplane of vectors with 0 for the XOR-sum condition). Therefore, the entire space we generate is contained in the hyperplane.

        However, the hyperplane has dimension (30 * n - 30) if we consider the 30 conditions? Actually, no: the condition is one condition per bit? There are 30 conditions? Each condition is a linear equation: the XOR of the n coordinates for bit b equals the bit b of S. So the hyperplane has dimension (30*n - 30)? 

        But wait: the conditions for the 30 bits are independent? 

        Actually, the condition for the entire vector y is:

            y_1 XOR y_2 XOR ... XOR y_n = S.

        This is 30 independent linear equations? (one for each bit). So the hyperplane has dimension 30*n - 30.

        However, our generated space might not be the entire hyperplane? 

        We computed the dimension of the generated space as:

            dim = sum_{b=0}^{29} (if the b-th bit is not constant then n-1 else 0)

        But the hyperplane has dimension 30*n - 30. How does our generated space relate to the hyperplane?

        Actually, we generated a subspace of the hyperplane? And we have:

            dim = (number of non-constant bits) * (n-1)

        Then the hyperplane has dimension 30*n - 30, and we have:

            (number of non-constant bits) * (n-1) = 30*(n-1) - (number of constant bits)*(n-1) + ...? 

        Actually, we must compare:

            dim = (n-1) * (#non-constant bits)

        and the hyperplane has dimension 30*n - 30 = 30*(n-1).

        Therefore, if every bit is non-constant, then dim = 30*(n-1) which is the entire hyperplane.

        But if there are constant bits, then we have dim = (n-1)*k, where k is the number of non-constant bits.

        However, note: the hyperplane has dimension 30*(n-1). Therefore, our generated space is a subspace of the hyperplane, and we have:

            dim = k*(n-1)

        and the hyperplane has dimension 30*(n-1). Then the number of distinct vectors in the generated space is 2^(k*(n-1)).

        But wait: the problem asks for the number of distinct sequences B we can obtain. Recall:

            We defined y_i = x_i XOR a_i, so x_i = y_i XOR a_i.

            And the vector y is in the set: 
                 initial y = a, and then we add any vector in the generated space.

            So the set of y is: a + V, where V is the generated space.

            Therefore, the number of distinct y is |V| = 2^(dim) = 2^(k*(n-1)).

        Then the number of distinct x is the same? Because x_i = y_i XOR a_i, so we have x = y XOR a. So the set of x is V? 

            x = (y XOR a) = (a + v) XOR a = v?   [but note: in GF(2), adding is XOR] 

            Actually: 
                y = a + v   -> then x = (a + v) XOR a = v? 

            Not exactly: if we think of the vector, we are doing componentwise: 
                x_i = y_i XOR a_i = (a_i + v_i) XOR a_i = v_i? 

            But wait: that would be true only if the addition is in GF(2) and we are doing XOR? Actually, in GF(2) addition is XOR. So:

                (a_i XOR v_i) XOR a_i = v_i.

            So x = v.

            Therefore, the set of achievable x is exactly the linear space V.

            So the number of distinct sequences B is |V| = 2^(k*(n-1)).

        But wait: the sample input n=3, a = [1,2,1]. 

          We need to compute k: the number of non-constant bits.

          Represent the numbers in binary:

            1: 01
            2: 10
            1: 01

          Bit0 (least significant): [1,0,1] -> not constant? 
                1,0,1: there are both 0 and 1 -> non-constant -> so dim0 = n-1 = 2.
          Bit1: [0,1,0] -> non-constant -> dim1 = 2.

          Then total dim = 2+2 = 4? Then the number of distinct sequences = 2^4 = 16? But the sample says 4.

        What went wrong?

        Let me check the sample: we obtained 4 sequences. Why did we get 4?

        Actually, the generated space for each bit is not independent? Or perhaps the entire vector space is not the direct sum? 

        Alternatively, we computed the dimension per bit? For each bit, we computed the dimension of the vector space in GF(2)^n. Then the entire space is the direct sum of these vector spaces? 

        Then the total dimension should be the sum of the dimensions per bit? 

        Why 2^4=16? But the sample says 4.

        How does the sample break per bit?

          For bit0: the graph is: 
            S0 = { i: a_i has bit0 set? } -> indices: i=0: has 1, i=1: has 0, i=2: has 1 -> so S0 = {0,2}, T0 = {1}. 
            Then the graph is connected -> dimension = n-1 = 2.

          For bit1: 
            S1 = { i: a_i has bit1 set? } -> a0:0, a1:1, a2:0 -> so S1={1}, T1={0,2} -> connected -> dimension=2.

          Then total dimension 2+2=4, so the number of distinct x is 2^4=16.

        But the sample only has 4 distinct B sequences.

        What is the disconnect?

        We must remember that the operations are not independent per bit? Actually, when we perform an operation on (i,j), we are flipping the entire integer (a_i XOR a_j) at positions i and j. This means we are flipping multiple bits simultaneously. 

        Therefore, we cannot break the problem into bits? 

        Alternatively, we did break the vector into bits, but the generators we considered for each bit were the same for every pair? 

        Actually, the generator for a pair (i,j) in the entire space is a vector in GF(2)^(30*n). And we broke it into 30 vectors in GF(2)^n. And the entire space is the direct sum of the spaces per bit. So the dimension should be additive.

        Why then is the sample 4? 

        Let me list the achievable x in the sample:

          We have: 
            (0,0,0)
            (3,3,0) -> 3 in binary: 11 -> so bit0 and bit1 are both 1.
            (3,0,3) 
            (0,3,3)

          How do we get (3,3,0)? 
            Operation on (0,1): 
                x0 becomes 0 XOR (a0 XOR a1) = 1 XOR 2 = 3? -> 1 XOR 2 = 3? Actually, 1 in binary 01, 2 in binary 10, XOR gives 11 which is 3.

          So the vector for the operation on (0,1) is: 
               v0,1 = (3, 3, 0)   [but wait: we add 3 at positions 0 and 1? Actually, the operation does:

                 b0 becomes b0 XOR (a0 XOR a1) = 0 XOR (1 XOR 2) = 3.
                 b1 becomes b1 XOR (1 XOR 2) = 0 XOR 3 = 3.
                 b2 remains 0.

          So the vector we added is (3,3,0). Similarly, an operation on (1,2) adds (0,3,3).

          Now, how to represent (3,3,0) in bits? 
            bit0: (1,1,0)
            bit1: (1,1,0)

          How about the vector (3,0,3) = (11,00,11) in binary for the integers? 
            bit0: (1,0,1)
            bit1: (1,0,1)

          Now, if we break into bits, the space for bit0 is generated by the vectors:

            We can get in bit0: 
                The generators for bit0: only consider pairs (i,j) such that a_i[0] != a_j[0]. 
                Such pairs: (0,1), (1,2) -> because a0[0]=1, a1[0]=0 -> different; a1[0]=0, a2[0]=1 -> different; a0[0]=1, a2[0]=1 -> same -> no edge.

                The generators for bit0 are: 
                    (1,1,0) and (0,1,1)   [for the pairs (0,1) and (1,2)].

                The space generated: we can take linear combinations:

                    0: (0,0,0)
                    (1,1,0)
                    (0,1,1)
                    (1,0,1)   [by adding (1,1,0) and (0,1,1): (1,1,0)+(0,1,1)=(1,0,1)]

                So the dimension for bit0 is 2? -> which matches.

          Similarly, for bit1: the pairs with different bits: 
                a0[1]=0, a1[1]=1 -> different; a0[1]=0, a2[1]=0 -> same; a1[1]=1, a2[1]=0 -> different.
                So pairs: (0,1) and (1,2). The generators are (1,1,0) and (0,1,1) for bit1.

                And we can get: (0,0,0), (1,1,0), (0,1,1), (1,0,1).

          Therefore, the entire space for the vector x is:

                x = (x0, x1, x2) = (x0_bit0, x0_bit1, ...) but we represent per bit.

                And the space for bit0 is 2-dimensional, and for bit1 is 2-dimensional, so total dimension 4.

          Then why are there only 4 vectors in the sample? 

          The catch: the operations are applied globally, not per bit. But we are allowed to do any linear combination of the generators, and the generators for different bits might be the same in the integer representation? 

          However, in the sample, we have only two generators: the operation on (0,1) gives (3,3,0) and on (1,2) gives (0,3,3). Then the space they generate is:

                Basis: 
                   v1 = (3,3,0) 
                   v2 = (0,3,3)

                Then the achievable vectors are:
                  0
                  v1
                  v2
                  v1+v2 = (3,0,3)

                -> 4 vectors.

          Why is the dimension only 2 in the integer space? 

          But note: in the integer representation, we are working in a ring, not in GF(2) for each bit independently? Actually, we are working in GF(2) for the entire integer? 

          However, the addition is bitwise independent, so the entire space is the direct sum of the spaces per bit. 

          Why then do we have 4 vectors in the entire space? Because 2^2 = 4.

          But we computed the dimension per bit: 2 for bit0 and 2 for bit1, total dimension 4? 

          This is a contradiction.

        Let me clarify: the vector space of the entire integer vectors is not GF(2)^(30*n), but rather (GF(2)^30)^n. And the generators are vectors in this space. The space is a vector space over GF(2) of dimension 30*n.

        The sample: n=3, so dimension 90? 

        But the two generators:

            v1 = (3,3,0) = 
                   bit0: (1,1,0)
                   bit1: (1,1,0)
            v2 = (0,3,3) = 
                   bit0: (0,1,1)
                   bit1: (0,1,1)

        These two vectors are linearly independent? 
            We cannot write v1 as a linear combination of v2? 
            Suppose a*v1 + b*v2 = 0.

            In bit0: a*(1,1,0) + b*(0,1,1) = (a, a+b, b) = (0,0,0) -> so a=0, then b=0? -> yes, independent.

            So the dimension is 2? 

        Why did we get 4? We considered each bit independently and thought we had two dimensions for bit0 and two for bit1, but in reality the generators we have are not independent per bit? 

        The issue is that the same linear combination coefficient is used for all bits in one operation.

        When we do an operation on (0,1), we are adding the vector v1 which affects both bits simultaneously. Similarly for v2.

        Therefore, the space generated is not the direct sum of the spaces per bit, but rather we have one global coefficient per generator (which is either 0 or 1) and the generator affects all bits at once.

        So the dimension of the entire space over GF(2) is the dimension of the space spanned by the generators (each generator is a vector in (GF(2)^30)^n) and there are O(n^2) generators? 

        But note: we can reduce the generators. In the sample, we only have two generators that are linearly independent.

        How to compute the dimension then? 

        We can represent each generator as a vector in GF(2)^(30*n) and then find the rank. But 30*n = 6e6, and the number of generators is O(n^2) which is 40e9 for n=200000, which is too many.

        We need a better approach.

        Insight: note that the generator for an edge (i,j) is the vector:

            v_{i,j} = (a_i XOR a_j) * (e_i + e_j)

        Let me define for each edge (i,j) the vector: 
            It has zeros except at positions i and j, and at these positions it has the same value: d = a_i XOR a_j.

        Now, consider the following: we can write the vector as:

            v_{i,j} = d * e_i + d * e_j.

        And note that d = a_i + a_j (in GF(2)^30) but as a vector.

        How can we find the linear span of { v_{i,j} }? 

        Another idea: 

            Let A = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n] as row vector.

            Consider the vector space spanned by the vectors:

                for every edge (i,j): 
                    at position i: a_i XOR a_j
                    at position j: a_i XOR a_j
                    elsewhere: 0.

            Note that a_i XOR a_j = a_i + a_j.

        Then we have:

            v_{i,j} = (a_i + a_j) * (e_i + e_j) = a_i e_i + a_i e_j + a_j e_i + a_j e_j.

        But note: this is not linear in the a_i's? 

        Alternatively, we can consider the following spanning set for the space:

            Let's consider a basis for the vector space generated by the a_i's over GF(2). Let the basis be of size r. Then any a_i can be written as a linear combination of the basis vectors.

        Also, note that the space of vectors we are generating is contained in the space of vectors that are 0-sum (XOR-sum 0) in the following sense: for each bit independently, the number of ones is even? -> no, the entire integer is added, but the condition is that the entire vector has XOR-sum 0 for the integers.

        But wait: we already know the entire vector must XOR to 0.

        How about we consider the following: 

            For a vector in the space, we have:

                x = sum_{edges} c_{i,j} * v_{i,j}

            where c_{i,j} are in GF(2).

        In components, for position k:

            x_k = sum_{j: j != k} c_{k,j} * (a_k + a_j)   [because only edges incident to k contribute]

            = (a_k) * (deg(k)) + sum_{j: j != k} c_{k,j} * a_j

            where deg(k) is the number of edges incident to k that are chosen.

        This must hold for each k.

        This is a linear system in the variables c_{i,j}. But the number of variables is O(n^2), too many.

        Another approach: 

            We can consider the following: 

                Let d_i = a_i. Then we can define a vector in (GF(2)^30)^n by:

                    x_i = a_i * s_i + t_i

                where s_i = deg(i) and t_i = sum_{j} c_{i,j} a_j   [but note the sum is over j such that the edge (i,j) is chosen].

        This seems messy.

        Known result: This problem has been studied in linear algebra over GF(2) for the entire space. 

        We can view the vector space as follows: 

            Let V be the vector space over GF(2) spanned by the vectors { v_{i,j} = (a_i XOR a_j)(e_i + e_j) }.

            Note that:

                v_{i,j} = (a_i e_i + a_i e_j) + (a_j e_i + a_j e_j)

                       = a_i (e_i+e_j) + a_j (e_i+e_j)

            This is not linear in a_i and a_j.

        Alternatively, we can try to relate to the following: 

            Consider the following vectors for each i:

                u_i = a_i e_i

            and also consider the all vector in the direction of the constant vector? 

        Insight: 

            v_{i,j} = (a_i e_i + a_j e_j) + (a_i e_j + a_j e_i)

            = (a_i e_i + a_j e_j) + (a_i e_j + a_j e_i)

        And note that the first two terms are the standard basis for the space spanned by the a_i e_i, and the last two terms are in the space spanned by the off-diagonal terms.

        But we can also note that the entire space might be generated by vectors of the form a_i e_i and also the vector with a_i in every coordinate? 

        Let me define the following vectors:

            w_i = a_i e_i   for i=1..n.

            and also the vector 

            w_const = (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)

        Then what is v_{i,j} in terms of these?

            v_{i,j} = (a_i e_i + a_j e_j) + (a_i e_j + a_j e_i) 
                     = (w_i + w_j) + (a_i e_j + a_j e_i)

        But the last two terms are not in the span of the w_i alone.

        Alternatively, we can note:

            v_{i,j} = a_i (e_i + e_j) + a_j (e_i + e_j) 
                     = (a_i + a_j) (e_i + e_j)   [which is what we had]

        And then we can also note that:

            (a_i + a_j)(e_i+e_j) = a_i e_i + a_i e_j + a_j e_i + a_j e_j.

        And then we can write the entire space as the span of the vectors:

            a_i e_i for i, 
            a_i e_j for i != j.

        But wait, the vector a_i e_j is not present in the span of the w_i's.

        Therefore, the space is generated by:

            { a_i e_j for any i,j }

        However, note that the generator v_{i,j} only gives us the combinations: a_i e_i, a_i e_j, a_j e_i, a_j e_j.

        But then the entire set of vectors a_i e_j might be linearly independent? 

        The dimension would be n * rank of the matrix formed by the a_i's.

        Specifically, if the a_i's span a space of dimension r over GF(2), then the vectors a_i e_j (for fixed j, the vectors a_i are in a space of dimension r) so the space spanned by { a_i e_j } for i=1..n and j=1..n would have dimension r * n.

        However, we have the following relations in the generators v_{i,j}:

            They are symmetric in i and j, and we only get the vector a_i e_i and a_i e_j and a_j e_i and a_j e_j for each edge.

        Actually, the space generated by the v_{i,j} might be the space of all vectors x = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) such that:

            condition1: the XOR-sum of the entire vector is 0.
            condition2: there exists a linear functional or something 

        Known result in linear algebra for such spaces: 

            This is the space of vectors x in (GF(2)^30)^n such that:

                sum_i x_i = 0   [XOR-sum]

                and 

                for every linear functional f in the dual space of the space spanned by the a_i's, the vector (f(x_1), f(x_2), ..., f(x_n)) is in the cut space of the complete graph.

        But this is complex.

        Alternatively, we can use the following: 

            For a vector x = (x_1,...,x_n) in (GF(2)^30)^n, we can write x_i in the basis of the a_i's? 

        Let's assume the a_i's span a space of dimension r. Then we can write each a_i in terms of basis vectors: say we have basis vectors b_1, b_2, ..., b_r.

        Then each a_i = sum_{k} c_{i,k} b_k.

        Then the vector v_{i,j} = (a_i XOR a_j) (e_i+e_j) = (sum_k (c_{i,k}+c_{j,k}) b_k) (e_i+e_j) = sum_k b_k * ( (c_{i,k}+c_{j,k}) (e_i+e_j) ).

        Therefore, the space decomposes by the basis vectors b_k. For each basis vector b_k, we have a space of vectors in GF(2)^n: namely the space generated by the vectors (c_{i,k}+c_{j,k}) (e_i+e_j) for all i<j.

        For a fixed k, let d_i = c_{i,k} (which is in GF(2)). Then the vector for edge (i,j) is (d_i+d_j) (e_i+e_j).

        This is exactly the same as the bit we considered before: 

            (d_i+d_j) is 0 if d_i==d_j, and 1 otherwise.

        And the space generated for this basis vector is the space of vectors in GF(2)^n that are 0 on the components where the complete graph for this bit is not connected? 

        Specifically, the space for basis vector b_k is:
             {0} if the bit-vector (d_i) is constant.
             otherwise, it's the cut space (space of vectors with even parity) of dimension n-1.

        Therefore, the entire space V has dimension = r * (n-1) - (number of basis vectors for which the bit-vector is constant) ??? 

        Wait, no: for each basis vector b_k, we get a space of dimension either 0 or n-1.

        Therefore, the total dimension is: 
             dim = (# of basis vectors b_k for which the bit-vector d_i is not constant) * (n-1)

        But note: the bit-vector for basis vector b_k is the vector (c_{i,k})_i, which is the representation of the basis vector b_k in the entire set a_i. 

        However, the condition of being constant: if the vector (c_{i,k})_i is constant, then the space for that basis vector is 0; otherwise, it's n-1.

        Therefore, we let r = the dimension of the span of {a_1, a_2, ..., a_n} over GF(2).

        And let k = the number of basis vectors b_k for which the vector (c_{i,k})_i is not constant.

        Then the dimension of the space V is: dim_V = k * (n-1).

        But note: the basis we choose is arbitrary. However, the property of (c_{i,k})_i being constant does depend on the basis? 

        Actually, we can choose a basis in which to represent the a_i's. The condition that a vector (c_{i,k})_i is constant for a basis vector b_k means that the entire set of a_i's have the same coefficient for b_k, i.e., the same value in that basis direction. 

        Alternatively, we can compute the following: 
            For each basis vector b_k, the condition is that the vector (c_{i,k})_i is not constant across i.

        How to compute k? 

        Note: the a_i's are vectors in GF(2)^30. The matrix C = (c_{i,k}) is an n by r matrix over GF(2), and each row is the representation of a_i.

        Then the condition for a column k is: the column is not constant.

        Therefore, k = the number of non-constant columns in the matrix C.

        But note: the matrix C is in reduced row echelon form? Not necessarily. We can use any basis. However, the property of a column being constant is basis-independent? 

        Actually, if we change the basis, the columns transform. But we can compute the following: 

            k = the number of basis vectors that are not in the span of the all-ones vector along with the other basis vectors? 

        Alternatively, we can think: the space generated by the a_i's might have a subspace that is constant across i? 

        Actually, the (c_{i,k})_i for a fixed k is the vector of coefficients for the basis vector b_k across the a_i's. 

        What does it mean for the entire vector (c_{i,k})_i to be constant? It means that the basis vector b_k is such that for every i, the coefficient is the same. 

        But note: if we consider the entire set of a_i's, then the difference between any two a_i and a_j should not have a component in the direction of a basis vector that is constant? 

        Actually, if a basis vector b_k has the same coefficient for every a_i, then it means that the entire set of a_i's have a common component: 

            a_i = common_part + varying_part_i.

        then a_i XOR a_j = (common_part XOR common_part) XOR (varying_part_i XOR varying_part_j) = varying_part_i XOR varying_part_j.

        Therefore, the common_part does not affect the difference. 

        Moreover, the common_part also appears in the definition of the generator: 
            v_{i,j} = (a_i XOR a_j) (e_i+e_j) = (varying_part_i XOR varying_part_j) (e_i+e_j)

        so it is independent of the common_part.

        Therefore, the common_part does not affect the generated space.

        How to compute the common_part? 

            The common_part is the AND of all a_i's? 

        But wait: in GF(2), the common_part might be the greatest common divisor? 

        Actually, we can define the common_part as the vector that is in the intersection of the span of the a_i's and that is constant across i. 

        Specifically, we want the largest vector c such that for every i, the vector a_i can be written as c + a_i', and then a_i' = a_i - c.

        Then the differences a_i XOR a_j = a_i' XOR a_j'.

        And the generated space is the same as if we had the array a_i' = a_i - c.

        Moreover, the a_i' have the property that their representations in the basis have the common_part removed.

        Therefore, the varying part has the property that the representations do not have any basis vector that is constant.

        In other words, for the varying part, in any basis, every basis vector will have a non-constant vector across i.

        Therefore, for the varying part, k = r, the dimension of the space spanned by the a_i''s.

        So then the dimension of the space V is: r * (n-1).

        But then in the sample: 
            a = [1,2,1] 
            Let's compute the common_part? 
              1: 01, 2:10, 1:01 -> no common bit? 
            Then the span of a_i's: 
                a0 = 01, a1=10, a2=01 -> the span has dimension 2? (since we have two independent vectors: 01 and 10)

            then r=2, and the dimension of V is 2*(3-1)=4, so the number of distinct sequences is 2^4=16.

        But the sample answer is 4.

        What is the resolution?

        We forgot the global constraint that the entire vector must have XOR-sum 0. 

        In the shifted representation for y, we have the constraint that the XOR-sum of the vector y must be the initial XOR-sum of a_i's, which is S = 1 XOR 2 XOR 1 = 2.

        But we also have: the generated space V is contained in the hyperplane of vectors with XOR-sum 0? 

        Why? Because each generator v_{i,j} has XOR-sum: 
            (a_i XOR a_j) XOR (a_i XOR a_j) = 0.

        Therefore, the entire space V has XOR-sum 0. 

        So the set of achievable vectors y is: initial_y = a, plus any vector in V. 
            y = a + v, with v in V.

        Then the XOR-sum of y = XOR-sum of a + XOR-sum of v = S + 0 = S.

        So the constraint is automatically satisfied.

        Therefore, the number of distinct y is |V| = 2^(dim_V) = 2^(r*(n-1)).

        In the sample, that would be 2^(2*2)=16.

        But the sample has only 4.

        I see the mistake: 

          The generated space V might be not the direct sum of the spaces for each basis vector? 

          In the sample, the two basis vectors (say we take the standard basis: b0 = [1,0] in GF(2)^2, and b1=[0,1]) yield:

             For b0: the vector (c_{i,0}) for i=0,1,2: a0=1, a1=0, a2=1 -> [1,0,1] -> not constant -> space for b0: dimension 2.
             For b1: [0,1,0] -> not constant -> space for b1: dimension 2.

          then the dimension would be 2+2=4.

          However, the catch is that the generators for the two basis vectors are not independent in the integer space because the same edge is used for both bits. 

          Specifically, when we do an operation on an edge (i,j), we get a vector that has ( (a_i XOR a_j) in the two coordinates of the vector at i and j. And (a_i XOR a_j) is the sum over the basis vectors with the coefficients (c_{i,k}+c_{j,k}) for each k.

          Therefore, the vector in the entire space is not the direct sum of the vectors per basis vector, because the coefficient for the edge (i,j) is the same for every basis vector.

          In other words, we have to use the same multiplier c_{i,j} in GF(2) for every basis vector.

          Therefore, the space is not the direct sum, and the dimension is not the sum of the dimensions per basis vector, but rather the dimension is the number of edges in a spanning set of the graph on the basis of the a_i's? 

          Specifically, the space is generated by the vectors ( for each edge (i,j) ) one vector in (GF(2)^30)^n, and the dimension is the rank of the set of these vectors.

          In the sample, we have two vectors: 
               v0 = (3,3,0) = ( in the basis: [1,1] for the first component, [1,1] for the second, [0,0] for the third ) 
               v1 = (0,3,3) = ( [0,0], [1,1], [1,1] )

          and they are linearly independent, so dimension 2.

          Therefore, the dimension of the space is the dimension of the space of edge choices that are linearly independent.

          How to compute that? 

          This is the cycle space of the complete graph? no, because we are not incidence vectors of edges.

          Alternatively, we can consider the following: 

             Let G be the complete graph on n vertices, and let's associate to each edge (i,j) the vector in GF(2)^n: 

                 u_{i,j} = (0,...,0, a_i XOR a_j, 0, ..., 0, a_i XOR a_j, 0,...) 
                           = (a_i XOR a_j) * (e_i+e_j)

             in the space (GF(2)^30)^n.

          Then we want the rank of { u_{i,j} }.

          Note that the space is the same as the space generated by the vectors (e_i+e_j) multiplied by the scalar (a_i XOR a_j) in the ring (GF(2)^30).

          In linear algebra, this is the tensor product of the space of edge vectors (which is the cut space, of dimension n-1) and the space spanned by the a_i's, but only if the scalar (a_i XOR a_j) is decomposable.

          But note: (a_i XOR a_j) = a_i + a_j, and this is in the space spanned by the a_i's.

          Specifically, we can write the space as the image of the map:

                \phi: GF(2)^{E} \to (GF(2)^{30})^n

                \phi( (c_{i,j}) ) = \sum_{i<j} c_{i,j} \cdot (a_i+a_j) (e_i+e_j)

          and we want the dimension of the image.

          Note that the vector (a_i+a_j) (e_i+e_j) = (a_i e_i + a_i e_j + a_j e_i + a_j e_j) = a_i (e_i+e_j) + a_j (e_i+e_j).

          We can also note that the space is the same as the space generated by the vectors:

             for each i: a_i e_i   ( multiplied by the degree in the edge space ) 
             for each i: a_i times the incidence vector of vertex i with the edges incident to it.

          But this is messy.

        Known result: 
            [1] The space is the set of vectors x = (x_1,...,x_n) in (GF(2)^30)^n such that:

                 sum_i x_i = 0 
                 and 
                 for every i, x_i is in the span of the a_i's.

            and additionally, there exists a vector in the space spanned by the a_i's, say v, such that 
                 x_i = a_i * v_i   [???] 

        Alternatively, we can use the following: 

            Let F be the space spanned by the a_i's.

            Then the space V is the set of vectors x in F^n such that sum_i x_i = 0.

            What is the dimension of this space? 
               We have one condition: sum_i x_i = 0, which is a vector condition in F: one condition -> codimension at most the dimension of F, which is r.
               Therefore, the dimension is n * r - r = r*(n-1).

            In the sample: r=2, n=3, then dimension=2*2=4.

        But wait, this space has dimension r*(n-1) and the sample only has dimension 2.

        The difference is that our generated space might be a subspace of this space. In fact, the space F^n and the condition sum_i x_i=0 has dimension r*(n-1), but our generated space is a subspace of it. 

        What is the dimension of the subspace we generate? 

            It is the rank of the set of vectors { (a_i XOR a_j)(e_i+e_j) }.

        And note: 

            (a_i XOR a_j)(e_i+e_j) is in F^n and has sum: (a_i XOR a_j) + (a_i XOR a_j) = 0, so it is in the space.

        In the sample, we have two vectors in a space of dimension 4, and they are linearly independent, so dimension 2.

        How to compute the rank in general? 

          We note that the vectors (a_i XOR a_j)(e_i+e_j) can be rewritten in terms of the a_i's. Specifically, it can be shown that the space they generate is the entire space of vectors x in F^n such that sum_i x_i = 0, EXCEPT when the a_i's are linearly dependent in a specific way.

        But wait: in the sample, the space of vectors x in F^n with sum_i x_i=0 has dimension 4, but we only generated a subspace of dimension 2. 

        Why only 2? 

          In the sample, let's list the space: 
             F = {0,1,2,3} ( but as a vector space of dimension 2 with basis{1,2} (represented as 01 and 10) )

          The space of vectors x = (x0, x1, x2) in F^3 such that x0+x1+x2=0 (XOR) is:
             We can write x0 = a, x1 = b, x2 = a XOR b, for any a, b in F? 
             dimension = 2 * 2 = 4.

          Our generated space: 
             basis: v1 = (3,3,0) = ( in basis: (1,1), (1,1), (0,0) ) 
                     = ( [1,1], [1,1], [0,0] ) in GF(2)^2.
                    v2 = (0,3,3) = ( [0,0], [1,1], [1,1] )

          then 
             v1 + v2 = (3,0,3) = ( [1,1], [0,0], [1,1] )
             and we have 0.

          Can we get a vector like (1,0,1)? 
             = ( [1,0], [0,0], [1,0] ) 
             This is in the space and has sum [1,0] XOR [0,0] XOR [1,0] = [0,0] =0.
             But is it in the span of {v1, v2}? 
                 solve: a v1 + b v2 = ( [a, a] , [a+b, a+b], [b,b] ) = ( [1,0], [0,0], [1,0] ) 
                 -> [a, a] = [1,0] -> a=1 and a=0 -> contradiction.

          Therefore, (1,0,1) is not in the span.

          So the generated space has dimension 2, while the ambient space has dimension 4.

        How to compute the dimension of the generated space? 

          It is known in linear algebra that the space generated by the vectors (a_i XOR a_j)(e_i+e_j) is the space of all vectors x in F^n such that:

             sum_i x_i = 0 
             and 
             there exists a vector
