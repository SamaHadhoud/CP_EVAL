To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct sequences \( B \) that can be obtained by performing zero or more operations on an initially zero sequence \( B \), where each operation involves selecting two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) and updating \( b_i \) and \( b_j \) using the bitwise XOR operation with \( a_i \oplus a_j \).

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The operations involve updating two elements of \( B \) simultaneously by XOR-ing them with \( a_i \oplus a_j \).
   - The key observation is that the entire sequence \( B \) must always satisfy the condition that the XOR of all elements is zero. This is because each operation adds \( a_i \oplus a_j \) to two elements, and \( (a_i \oplus a_j) \oplus (a_i \oplus a_j) = 0 \), preserving the total XOR sum.
   - The problem can be transformed into linear algebra over \( GF(2) \). The sequence \( B \) is viewed as a vector in \( (GF(2)^{30})^n \), and each operation corresponds to adding a vector \( (a_i \oplus a_j)(e_i + e_j) \), where \( e_i \) is the standard basis vector.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The set of achievable vectors \( B \) forms a linear subspace. The dimension of this subspace is determined by the rank of the matrix formed by the vectors \( a_i \) and whether the bits are constant across all elements.
   - Specifically, if the vectors \( a_i \) span a space of dimension \( r \), and considering the constraint that the sum of the sequence elements must be zero, the dimension of the subspace is \( r \times (n - 1) \).

3. **Algorithm Selection**:
   - **Step 1**: Compute the XOR of all elements in \( a \) to check if it's zero. If not, adjust the vectors to ensure the common part is removed.
   - **Step 2**: Determine the rank \( r \) of the matrix formed by the vectors \( a_i \). This rank is crucial as it influences the dimension of the solution space.
   - **Step 3**: The number of distinct sequences \( B \) is \( 2^{r \times (n - 1)} \mod 998244353 \). Special cases, such as all elements being zero, are handled separately.

### Solution Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cctype>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

const long long MOD = 998244353;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);

    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<long long> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> a[i];
    }

    long long total_xor = 0;
    for (long long x : a) {
        total_xor ^= x;
    }

    bool all_same = true;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (a[i] != a[0]) {
            all_same = false;
            break;
        }
    }

    if (all_same) {
        cout << 1 << endl;
        return 0;
    }

    int rank = 0;
    vector<long long> basis;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        long long x = a[i];
        for (long long b : basis) {
            if ((x ^ b) < x) 
                x ^= b;
        }
        if (x != 0) {
            basis.push_back(x);
            sort(basis.rbegin(), basis.rend());
            rank++;
        }
    }

    long long power = (long long)rank * (n - 1);
    long long ans = 1;
    long long base = 2;
    while (power > 0) {
        if (power % 2 == 1) {
            ans = (ans * base) % MOD;
        }
        base = (base * base) % MOD;
        power /= 2;
    }

    cout << ans << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Initial Checks**:
   - The code first checks if all elements in the array \( a \) are the same. If they are, the only possible sequence \( B \) is the zero sequence, so the answer is 1.
   - The total XOR of all elements in \( a \) is computed to understand if there's a common component across all elements.

2. **Basis Construction**:
   - The rank \( r \) of the matrix formed by the vectors \( a_i \) is computed using Gaussian elimination. This rank determines the dimension of the solution space.

3. **Modular Exponentiation**:
   - The number of distinct sequences \( B \) is \( 2^{r \times (n - 1)} \mod 998244353 \). This is computed efficiently using modular exponentiation to handle large numbers.

This approach efficiently leverages linear algebra over \( GF(2) \) to determine the solution space's dimension, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes. The solution handles edge cases and uses modular arithmetic to comply with the problem constraints.
