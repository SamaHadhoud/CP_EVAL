We are counting the number of compositions (ordered partitions) of n into positive integers that form a zig-zag sequence (also known as up-down or down-up sequences). The sequence must satisfy either:
  a1 < a2 > a3 < a4 > ...   (starting with an increase) OR
  a1 > a2 < a3 > a4 < ...   (starting with a decrease)

Note: The problem requires the entire sequence to alternate in the specified pattern until the end.

Let f(n) be the total number of such compositions.

We can split the problem into two cases:
  Case 1: Compositions starting with an increase (i.e., the first comparison is '<').
  Case 2: Compositions starting with a decrease (i.e., the first comparison is '>').

But note: a single element (s=1) is not forced to have any comparison? Actually, the conditions say "at least one of the following" meaning that if the sequence has only one element, then both conditions are trivially false? However, the problem states "at least one of the following is true", and if there is only one element, then the condition is not satisfied? 

But wait: the problem says "at least one of the following" meaning either the first pattern OR the second pattern. However, for a single element, we have:
  Condition 1: a1 < a2 ... -> but there is no a2, so condition fails.
  Condition 2: similarly fails.

Therefore, a single element does not satisfy? That would be a problem because in the example for n=1, there should be 1 way? But the problem says "non-empty stacks" and the total sum is n. And the figure for n=6 shows that a single stack is included? Actually, in the figure for n=6, the first row is a single stack of 6. How is that zig-zag?

Let me read the condition again: "at least one of the following is true". For a single element, we don't have any relation. So the condition fails? But the problem says "each stack is non-empty" and that's the only condition? 

Actually, the problem states that the sequence of stack sizes must be zig-zag. The zig-zag condition requires at least two elements to have the first relation. So what about sequences of length 1? 

Looking at the sample: for n=5, the answer is 7. How?
We can list for n=5:

Length 1: [5] -> not zig-zag? But the problem states: "at least one of the following" and neither condition holds? So that shouldn't be included.

But the sample output for n=5 is 7. Let me list:

We can have sequences of different lengths:

Length 1: not valid? -> 0
Length 2: 
  Condition 1: a1 < a2 -> then a1+a2=5: (1,4), (2,3) -> 2 ways.
  Condition 2: a1 > a2 -> then (4,1), (3,2) -> 2 ways. 
  But note: the two conditions are mutually exclusive? Actually, for length 2, the first condition is a1 < a2 and the second is a1 > a2. So they are disjoint. But also, we cannot have both conditions at the same time? So for length 2, we have 4 ways? 

Length 3: 
  Condition 1: a1 < a2 > a3 -> and a1+a2+a3=5. We list:
    a1=1: then a2>1 and a2>a3, and a3>=1. Also a2>=a3+1. 
        a2=2 -> a3=2? no, because 1+2+2=5 -> then a1=1, a2=2, a3=2 -> but condition: 1<2 and 2>2 -> false. 
        a2=3 -> a3=1: 1<3>1 -> valid. 
        a2=4 -> a3=0? invalid.
    a1=2: then a2>2 -> a2>=3. Then a3=5-2-a2=3-a2. Since a2>=3, then a3<=0 -> invalid.
    So only (1,3,1)
  Condition 2: a1 > a2 < a3 -> 
    a1 must be at least 2. 
    a1=2: then a2<2 -> a2=1 -> then a3=5-2-1=2 -> then 2>1 and 1<2 -> valid: (2,1,2)
    a1=3: then a2<3 -> 
        a2=1 -> a3=1 -> 3>1 and 1<1 -> false? because 1<1 fails? 
        a2=2 -> a3=0 -> invalid.
    a1=4: then a2<4 -> but then a3=5-4-a2=1-a2 -> negative? invalid.
    So only (2,1,2) for condition2.

  But wait, what about (1,2,2)? It doesn't satisfy condition1 because 2>2 fails? 
  And (3,1,1): condition2: 3>1 holds, then 1<1 fails? 

  So only two for length 3? 

Length 4:
  Condition1: a1 < a2 > a3 < a4 -> 
      Let a1 = a, a2 = b, a3 = c, a4 = d. Then a < b, b > c, c < d, and a+b+c+d=5.
      Since all at least 1, the minimum sum is 4. So we can have:
        a=1, b=2, c=1, d=1 -> 1<2>1<1 -> valid? but note: 1<1? no, the last relation is c<d -> 1<1 is false.
        a=1, b=3, c=1, d=0 -> invalid.

      Actually, we have only 4 elements and minimum 1 each, so the only possibility is 1,1,1,2? but then:
        a1=1, a2=1: fails a1 < a2? 
        How about: 1,2,1,1 -> then: 1<2 (ok), 2>1 (ok), 1<1 (fails).
      So no valid for condition1?

  Condition2: a1 > a2 < a3 > a4 -> 
      a1>a2, a2<a3, a3>a4, and sum=5.
      Possibilities: 
        a1=2, a2=1, a3=1, a4=1 -> 2>1 (ok), 1<1 (fails) -> invalid.
        a1=3, a2=1, a3=1, d=0 -> invalid.
        a1=2, a2=1, a3=2, d=0 -> invalid? because we need 4 numbers.

      Actually, the minimum for each is 1, so the numbers are at least 1. The only possibility is 1+1+1+2=5.
      How to arrange? 
        Condition2: must start with a1>a2. So a1 must be at least 2? then a1=2, then a2=1, then a3=1, then a4=1: but then 2>1 (ok), then 1<1? fails.

      So no valid for condition2?

Length 5: 
  Condition1: a1 < a2 > a3 < a4 > a5 -> 
      The minimum is 1+1+1+1+1=5. Then the sequence must be: [1,1,1,1,1] -> 
        1<1 -> fails at the first step.

  Condition2: a1>a2<a3>a4<a5 -> 
      [1,1,1,1,1]: 1>1 fails.

So total for n=5: 
  Length2: 4 ways? 
  Length3: 2 ways? 
  Total = 6? but sample output is 7.

Wait, what about the two conditions? The problem says "at least one of the following" meaning that if a composition satisfies condition1 OR condition2, then it is valid.

But for sequences of length 1: we have one composition: [5]. However, it satisfies neither condition. So it should not be counted? 

But the sample output for n=5 is 7. So what are the 7 compositions?

After re-examining known sequences: 
In fact, the sequence of length 1 is allowed? How? 

Looking at the definition: the problem says "at least one of the following is true". But if the sequence has length 1, then there are no relations. The conditions are defined for the entire sequence? 

Actually, the conditions are written with the pattern of comparisons. For a sequence of length 1, there are no comparisons. Therefore, the condition fails? 

But then how do we get 7? 

I recall that in combinatorics, the alternating permutations (or zigzag permutations) for n=1 is 1. But note: in our problem, we are talking about compositions (the integers are positive and order matters) and the zig-zag condition is defined on the sequence of integers.

After checking known results: 
The sequence for the number of zigzag compositions (also called up-down compositions) is known in OEIS: A025047. 

For n=1: 1 (the composition [1])
For n=2: 2 (for each condition: [1,1] is not valid? because 1<1 fails and 1>1 fails? but wait, the OEIS entry: 
  A025047: Number of alternating compositions, n=1: 1, n=2: 2, n=3: 3, n=4: 6, n=5: 12? -> but our sample n=6 is 12.

Actually, our problem: 
  n=5: output 7, n=6: 12, n=7:19.

Looking at OEIS: A025047: 
  1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, ... -> that doesn't match.

But wait, the problem states for n=6: 12, and the sample output for n=5 is 7 and n=7 is 19.

I found: OEIS A001250: Number of alternating permutations of order n: 1,1,2,4,10,32, ... -> no.

Another known result: the number of compositions of n with alternating up and down runs? 

Alternatively, note that the problem says that the two patterns are: 
  Pattern 1: <, >, <, >, ... 
  Pattern 2: >, <, >, <, ...

But for a sequence of length 1: we don't have any inequality. How is it handled?

In the literature, a single element is considered to be both up and down? Actually, in the problem statement, the illustration for n=6 includes a single stack (6) as one of the 12. Therefore, we must include the compositions of length 1.

So how to reconcile? 

The problem states: "at least one of the following is true". Since for length 1, both conditions are vacuously false? 

But then why is [6] included? 

Rethink: the condition for a sequence of length s:
  If s=1: then there are no inequalities. The condition is: 
      "at least one of the following is true" 
        - the first pattern (which requires at least two terms to define the first '<')? 
        - the second pattern (which requires at least one '>').

But the problem does not specify that the entire pattern must be defined? Actually, the pattern is defined for the entire sequence. For a sequence of length 1, there is no inequality. Therefore, the condition fails? 

But the problem says "at least one of the following is true", and if the sequence is too short to have the pattern, then the condition fails. 

However, the sample includes the single stack. Therefore, the problem must have intended that sequences of length 1 are valid.

This is confirmed by the sample: for n=6, the first diagram is a single stack.

Therefore, we must consider that a sequence of length 1 is valid. How to interpret the condition? 

We can reinterpret the condition: 
  The condition is automatically satisfied if the sequence has length 1? 

Actually, the problem states "at least one of the following" meaning the two patterns. We can define the patterns for sequences of length 1 as being satisfied? 

But the pattern definitions are written with alternating inequalities that require at least two adjacent terms. 

Therefore, the problem likely intends to include sequences of length 1. So we assume:

  - For s=1: valid.
  - For s>=2: the sequence must be of one of the two alternating types.

So we can define:

  f(1) = 1.

But then for n=2: 
  [2] -> valid? (s=1) -> 1 way.
  [1,1]: fails because 1<1 is false and 1>1 is false? -> invalid.
  [1,1] is the only composition of length 2 for n=2? and it fails.

  But wait: [1,1] is one composition. Then total = 1? but the problem: n=2, how many compositions? 
  The compositions: 
      [2] -> valid? 
      [1,1] -> invalid? 
      [1,1] is the same as [1,1]? and [2] is one.

  So total=1? 

But the sample input does not have n=2. However, from the known answers for n=5,6,7: 
  n=5:7, n=6:12, n=7:19.

We can try to list for n=3:

  s=1: [3] -> valid -> 1 way.
  s=2: 
      [1,2]: 1<2 -> valid for pattern1? -> but pattern1 requires the entire pattern: for length2: pattern1 is a1<a2 -> valid.
      [2,1]: 2>1 -> valid for pattern2? 
      [1,2] and [2,1] -> but also [3] -> total 3? 
  s=3: 
      Pattern1: a1<a2>a3: 
          (1,2,0) invalid? 
          (1,1,1): 1<1 -> fails.
          (1,2,0) invalid? 
          (2,2, -1) invalid? 
          So only (1,2,0) not valid -> none?
      Pattern2: a1>a2<a3: 
          (2,1,0) invalid? 
          (3,1,-1) invalid? 
          (2,1,0) invalid? 
          So none? 
  So total for n=3: 1 (for s=1) + 2 (for s=2) = 3.

But known: n=5:7, n=6:12, n=7:19.

If we list for n=3: 
  [3] 
  [1,2] 
  [2,1] 
  [2,1] is different from [1,2]? 
  So 3 ways.

But wait, what about [1,1,1]? 
  For pattern1: 1<1 fails at the first step -> invalid.
  For pattern2: 1>1 fails at the first step -> invalid.
  So [1,1,1] is not included.

So for n=3: 3.

Now for n=4:

  s=1: [4] -> 1
  s=2: 
      Pattern1: a1 < a2 -> pairs: 
          (1,3), (2,2) -> but (2,2): 2<2 fails -> so only (1,3) -> 1 way?
      Pattern2: a1>a2: (3,1), (2,2) -> (2,2): 2>2 fails -> only (3,1) -> 1 way?
      So 2 ways for s=2? 
  s=3: 
      Pattern1: a1 < a2 > a3: 
          a1>=1, a2>=2, a3>=1, and a1+a2+a3=4.
          a1=1: then a2>=2 and a2>a3, and a3>=1 -> 1+a2+a3=4 -> a2+a3=3 -> 
               a2=2: a3=1 -> 1<2>1 -> valid.
               a2=3: a3=0 -> invalid.
          a1=2: then a2>=3? and a2>a3, a3>=1 -> 2+a2+a3=4 -> a2+a3=2 -> 
               a2=2: but 2>=3 fails? 
               a2=3: then a3=-1 -> invalid.
          So only (1,2,1)
      Pattern2: a1>a2<a3: 
          a1>=2, a2>=1, a3>=1, and a1>a2 and a2<a3, and a1+a2+a3=4.
          a1=2: then a2<2 -> a2=1 -> then a3 = 4-2-1=1 -> then 1<1 fails? 
          a1=3: then a2<3 -> a2=1 -> then a3=0? invalid; a2=2 -> then a3 = 4-3-2 = -1 -> invalid.
          So none? 
      But wait: what about (2,1,1) for pattern2: 
          a1=2, a2=1, a3=1: 
             2>1 (ok), then 1<1 (fails) -> invalid.
          So none? 
      So only 1 way for s=3? 
  s=4: 
      Pattern1: a1<a2>a3<a4: 
          a1>=1, a2>=2, a3>=1, a4>=1? and a1+a2+a3+a4=4 -> minimum sum 1+2+1+1=5 -> no solution.
      Pattern2: a1>a2<a3>a4: 
          minimum sum: 1+1+1+1=4 -> but then a1>a2: 1>1 fails? 
          So no solution? 
  Total: 1+2+1 = 4.

But we expect for n=4: from the known pattern? We don't have n=4 in the sample. However, the problem states that for n=6 there are 12.

Alternatively, we can use the known sample: 
  n=5:7 -> 
      s=1: [5] -> 1
      s=2: 
          Pattern1: a1<a2: (1,4), (2,3) -> 2
          Pattern2: a1>a2: (4,1), (3,2) -> 2 -> total 4 for s=2?
      s=3: 
          Pattern1: a1<a2>a3: 
               a1=1: a2>=2, a2>a3, a3>=1 -> 1+a2+a3=5 -> a2+a3=4 -> 
                   a2=2: a3=2 -> 1<2>2 -> fails at the last (because 2>2 fails? -> no, it must be strictly greater? 
                   The problem does not say strict? It says > and <, which in mathematics usually means strict? 
                   The problem: "a1 < a2 > a3" -> so yes, strict inequalities.
                   Therefore: a2 must be at least 3? 
                   a2=3: a3=1 -> 1<3>1 -> valid.
                   a2=4: a3=0 -> invalid.
               a1=2: a2>=3 -> then 2+a2+a3=5 -> a2+a3=3 -> 
                   a2=3: a3=0 -> invalid.
               a1=3: a2>=4 -> then 3+a2+a3=5 -> a2+a3=2 -> impossible.
               So only (1,3,1) -> 1 way.

          Pattern2: a1>a2<a3: 
               a1>=2, a2>=1, a3>=1, and a1>a2 and a2<a3, and a1+a2+a3=5.
               a1=2: a2=1 -> a3=2 -> 2>1 and 1<2 -> valid: (2,1,2)
               a1=3: a2=1 -> then a3=1 -> 3>1 (ok) but 1<1 (fails) -> invalid.
                     a2=2 -> then a3=0 -> invalid.
               a1=4: a2=1 -> a3=0 -> invalid; a2=2 -> a3=-1 -> invalid; a2=3 -> a3=-2 -> invalid.
               So only (2,1,2) -> 1 way.
          Total s=3: 2 ways.

      s=4: 
          Pattern1: a1<a2>a3<a4: 
               a1>=1, a2>=2, a3>=1, a4>=1, and a1+a2+a3+a4=5 -> minimum 1+2+1+1=5 -> only possibility: (1,2,1,1) -> 
                   1<2 (ok), 2>1 (ok), 1<1 (fails) -> invalid.
               How about (1,3,1,0) -> invalid? 
               (1,1,1,2): then 1<1 fails -> invalid.
               (2,1,1,1): for pattern1: 2<1 fails -> invalid.
               So no valid? 

          Pattern2: a1>a2<a3>a4: 
               minimum 1+1+1+1=4 -> we need 5, so one extra. 
               Possibilities: 
                 (2,1,1,1): 2>1 (ok), 1<1 (fails) -> invalid.
                 (1,1,1,2): for pattern2: first relation: 1>1 fails -> invalid.
                 (3,1,1,0) invalid.
                 (2,1,2,0) invalid.
               How about (3,1,1,0) invalid? 
               Actually, we can have: (2,1,2,0) invalid? 
               The only way to get 5 is to have one of the numbers be 2 and the rest 1. 
                 (2,1,1,1): fails as above.
                 (1,2,1,1): fails for pattern2: first 1>2 fails? 
                 (1,1,2,1): fails: 1>1 fails.
                 (1,1,1,2): fails: 1>1 fails.
               So none? 
          So s=4: 0.

      s=5: 
          Pattern1: a1<a2>a3<a4>a5: 
              [1,1,1,1,1]: 1<1 fails -> invalid.
          Pattern2: similarly invalid.

      Total for n=5: 1 (s=1) + 4 (s=2) + 2 (s=3) = 7. -> matches.

So we have:

  f(n) = number of compositions of n (with parts >=1) that are either:
        - of length 1, OR
        - of length>=2 and satisfy one of the two alternating patterns (with strict inequalities).

Now, how to compute f(n) for n up to 300000 and t up to 300000?

We need an efficient method.

Known generating function: 

Let A(x) = sum_{n>=1} f(n) x^n.

We can split f(n) by the starting condition: 
  Let g(n) = number of alternating compositions of n starting with an increase (for sequences of length>=2) and including the length1? 
  But note: the length1 sequence: we can consider it as a base case.

Actually, we can define two sequences:

  Let u(n) = number of alternating compositions of n that are of the form: 
        either of length 1, OR of the form (starting with an increase) but note: for length1 we don't have an increase? 
        so we define:
          u(n): compositions that are either:
                [n] (if we consider it as a special case) 
                OR starting with an increase and then alternating? 
          But wait: the entire composition must be alternating. And for the first element, we don't have a previous? 

Alternatively, we can use the standard approach for alternating compositions:

We define:
  Let a(n) = number of alternating compositions of n that start with an increase (for sequences of length>=2) and also including the single element? 
  But the single element is not an increase? 

Standard approach (from literature) for alternating compositions:

  We define:
    A_k(x) = generating function for alternating compositions ending with the last part being k and the last step was an increase (meaning the next would be a decrease) 
    B_k(x) = generating function for alternating compositions ending with the last part being k and the last step was a decrease.

But we also have to consider the starting condition.

Alternatively, we note that the generating function for alternating compositions is known to be:

  A(x) = (1 + F(x)) / (1 - F(x))   ?   not exactly.

From the literature (reference: "Combinatorics of Compositions and Words" by Silvia Heubach and Toufik Mansour), we know:

  Let S be the set of alternating compositions. We can write:

      S = E + (UP) + (DOWN)

  where E is the empty composition? but we don't have that.

  Actually, we can define:

      Let U be the set of alternating compositions that start with an increase (and have at least two parts) OR the single element? 
      Let D be the set of alternating compositions that start with a decrease (and have at least two parts) OR the single element? 

  But note: the single element is both? 

  Alternatively, we can define:

      S = Z (the set of compositions that are alternating OR single element).

      Then we can write:

        Z = { [a] for a>=1 } ∪ (UP) ∪ (DOWN)

        where 
          UP: compositions that start with an increase and have at least two parts: the first part a1, then a composition from D (starting with a decrease) but with the condition that a1 < the first element of the D composition? 

        Similarly, DOWN: compositions that start with a decrease and have at least two parts: the first part a1, then a composition from U but with a1 > the first element of the U composition.

      However, we can also note that the composition after the first part must be alternating and the first step must be in the opposite direction.

      But the composition after the first part is itself an alternating composition? But note: the entire composition after the first part must start with a part that is compared appropriately with the first.

      Actually, we can define:

        Let U(x) = generating function for alternating compositions that are either single elements or start with an increase (for the first two elements) and then alternate? 
        But wait: the single element is included in both U and D? 

      We can define:

        U(x) = sum_{n>=1} u(n) x^n, where u(n) counts the compositions that are either:
                - [n] (a single element), 
                - or start with an increase and then the rest is a composition that starts with a decrease and the entire composition is alternating? 

        Similarly, D(x) = sum_{n>=1} d(n) x^n, for compositions that are either [n] or start with a decrease.

        Then we have: 
          u(n) = 1 (for the single element) + 
                  sum_{k=1}^{n-1} [ for the composition starting with k, then we need the next part to be greater than k? and then the rest is a composition from d that starts with a value j>k? but note the entire tail must be an alternating composition that starts with a decrease? and the first element of the tail must be j? 

          Actually, we break the composition: 
            The composition is: k, then a composition from D that has first element j>k? but wait: the entire tail is a composition from D? and the condition is that k < j? 

          However, the composition from D is defined as: either a single element (which would be j) or starting with a decrease? 

          But note: the tail must form an alternating composition that starts with a decrease? However, the entire tail must start with j and then the next element must be less than j? 

          But the first element of the tail is j, and we require k < j. Then the tail composition (which is in D) is independent? 

          Similarly for D: 
            d(n) = 1 + sum_{k=1}^{n-1} [ compositions starting with k (as the first element) and then a tail from U that starts with j and k>j ]

        But then the generating functions:

          U(x) = x/(1-x) is not directly.

        Actually, we can write:

          Consider the first part is k. Then the tail is an alternating composition that starts with a part j>k? but note: the entire tail must be an alternating composition that itself is in D? However, in the definition of D, the composition must start with a decrease? but the tail starts with j (which is the first part of the tail) and then the next part must be less than j? 

        But the condition for the tail is independent of k? except that we require the first part of the tail (which we call j) to be > k for U and < k for D.

        Therefore, we can write:

          Let U(x) = sum_{n} u(n) x^n, and D(x) = sum_{n} d(n) x^n.

          Then:

            For a composition in U: 
               It is either a single element: then u_single = x + x^2 + ... = x/(1-x)
               Or it has at least two parts: the first part is k (for k>=1), then the next part j>k, and then the rest is a composition that starts with j and is in D? but wait: the composition that starts with j must be an alternating composition that starts with a decrease? 

            Actually, the entire tail (which is the composition after the first part k) is an alternating composition that must start with a decrease? but note: the tail composition is a composition of n-k, and it must start with j>k, and then the rest? 

            However, we can think: the entire tail is an alternating composition that is in D? but with the additional constraint that the first element of the tail must be greater than k? 

            But the generating function for compositions in D that start with a value j>k? 

            We can express:

              U(x) = x/(1-x) + sum_{k>=1} x^k * [ sum_{j>k} x^j * D_{j}(x) ]

            where D_{j}(x) is the generating function for compositions in D that start with j? 

            But note: the tail composition of the entire composition is a composition in D, but we don't fix j? 

            Alternatively, we can define:

              Let D(x) = sum_{j>=1} D_j(x), where D_j(x) is the generating function for compositions in D that start with j.

            Similarly, U(x) = sum_{j>=1} U_j(x).

            Then:

              U_j(x) = [if we consider the composition starting with j and in U] then the generating function for such compositions is: 
                 for j: the generating function is x^j * [1 + ...] 

            But we have recurrences:

              For a composition in D that starts with j: 
                 It can be just [j] -> then D_j(x) = x^j.
                 Or it can be j followed by a composition in U that starts with k and we require j>k? -> then D_j(x) = x^j * [ sum_{k=1}^{j-1} U_k(x) ]? 

            Similarly, for U that starts with j: 
                 U_j(x) = x^j + x^j * [ sum_{k=j+1}^{infty} D_k(x) ]

          Then we have:

            U(x) = sum_j U_j(x) 
            D(x) = sum_j D_j(x)

          Then:

            U_j(x) = x^j ( 1 + sum_{k=j+1}^{infty} D_k(x) )
            D_j(x) = x^j ( 1 + sum_{k=1}^{j-1} U_k(x) )

          Then we can write:

            Let U(x) = sum_j U_j(x), D(x)=sum_j D_j(x)

            Then:

              U(x) = sum_j x^j ( 1 + sum_{k=j+1}^{infty} D_k(x) )
                     = x/(1-x) + sum_j x^j * [D(x) - D^{(j)}(x)] 
                     where D^{(j)}(x) = sum_{k=1}^{j} D_k(x)

            This seems messy.

Alternatively, we can use dynamic programming and generating functions with prefixes.

But note: the known generating function for alternating compositions is:

  A(x) = (1 - x) * (1 + F(x)) / (1 - 2*x)   ??? 

I recall a generating function from OEIS: 

  The generating function for A025047 (which is the number of alternating compositions) is:

      (1 - x - sqrt(1 - 2*x - 3*x^2)) / (2*x)   ? 

But wait, A025047: 
  n: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
  a(n): 1,1,2,3,6,9,18,30,56,99

But our sample: 
  n=5:7, n=6:12 -> not matching.

Another possibility: our sequence is known as the number of up-down (or down-up) compositions of n? 

In fact, the problem for n=5:7, n=6:12, n=7:19.

Searching: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12, 19 -> not found.

Wait, our calculations:

  n=1:1
  n=2: [2] and [1,1] is not valid? -> only [2] -> 1? 
        but then n=3:3, n=4:4, n=5:7 -> not matching.

But we have:

  n=1:1
  n=2: [2] -> valid; [1,1] -> invalid -> total 1.
  n=3: [3], [1,2], [2,1] -> 3.
  n=4: [4], [1,3], [3,1], [1,2,1] -> 4? 
  n=5: 7: [5], [1,4], [4,1], [2,3], [3,2], [1,3,1], [2,1,2] -> 7.

But then n=6:12.

This sequence: 1,1,3,4,7,12 -> next term 19 (n=7) -> and then for n=8: 31? 

But we have a recurrence? 

We can try to derive a recurrence:

  Let u(n) = number of alternating compositions of n that start with an increase (including single element) 
  Let d(n) = number of alternating compositions of n that start with a decrease (including single element)

  Then:
      f(n) = u(n) + d(n) - [n]   because the single element is counted in both? 
          = u(n) + d(n) - 1   for n>=1? 

  But wait: we defined u(n) to include the single element, and d(n) also include the single element. So if we do:

      f(n) = u(n) + d(n) - 1   [because the single element is counted twice]

  However, note that a composition of length>=2 is counted only in one of u(n) or d(n)? 

  Actually, the single element is counted in both u(n) and d(n). And a composition of length>=2 is counted either in u(n) or d(n) (but not both) because it must start with either an increase or a decrease? 

  But the first two elements determine whether it is u or d? 

  Therefore, we can write:

      f(n) = u(n) + d(n) - [n==1? then we subtract one single element that is double counted? 

  Actually, for each n, the single element [n] is counted in both u(n) and d(n). And no other composition is counted in both. So:

      f(n) = u(n) + d(n) - (1 if n>=1 then 1 else 0)   -> but wait, for n=1: 
          u(1)=1, d(1)=1, then f(1)=1+1-1=1. 
          for n=2: 
            u(2)=? 
              single element: [2] -> included? -> then also in d(2) we have [2] -> but then we subtract 1? 
              and the compositions of length2: [1,1] is not valid, so we don't have any of length2 in u or d? 
              so u(2)=1, d(2)=1, then f(2)=1+1-1=1 -> which matches.

          n=3: 
            u(3)=? 
               [3] -> 1
               compositions starting with an increase: [1,2] -> valid? -> so 1 more -> total 2.
            d(3)= 
               [3] ->1
               [2,1] ->1 -> total 2.
            f(3)=2+2-1=3.

          n=4: 
            u(4)= 
               [4] ->1
               [1,3] ->1
               [1,2,1] -> valid? 
                    [1,2,1]: 1<2 (increase) then 2>1 (decrease) -> valid? -> so 1 more.
               total 3.
            d(4)=
               [4] ->1
               [3,1] ->1
               [2,1,1] -> invalid? 
               [3,1] is valid? 
               [1,2,1] is in u, not in d.
               any in d? 
                 [3,1] is valid for d: because it starts with a decrease? 
                 also, [2,1,?] -> [2,1,1]: 2>1 (decrease) then 1<1 fails? -> invalid.
                 [4] and [3,1] -> total 2.
            then f(4)=3+2-1=4.

          n=5: 
            u(5):
               [5] ->1
               [1,4] ->1
               [2,3] ->1
               [1,3,1] ->1  (because 1<3>1: valid)
               [1,4] is valid? 
               [2,3] is valid? 
               [1,2,2] -> invalid.
               [1,2,1,1] -> invalid.
               [1,3,1] is valid.
               also [2,3] is valid for u: because 2<3, then we are done? 
               but also compositions of length4 and 5? 
                 [1,4] -> valid, then the tail is [4] which is valid in d? but no, the entire composition is [1,4] and then it ends? 
                 so [1,4] is valid: 1<4 -> valid for u.

               and [2,3] valid: 2<3.

               What about [1,2,2] -> invalid.
               [2,1,2] -> but this starts with 2, then 2>1 -> so it should be in d? 

               also: [1,4] is included, [2,3] is included, [1,3,1] is included.

               total u(5)=1+1+1+1=4.

            d(5):
               [5] ->1
               [4,1] ->1
               [3,2] ->1
               [2,1,2] -> valid: 2>1 and then 1<2 -> valid.
               total 4.

            then f(5)=4+4-1=7.

  So the recurrence for u(n) and d(n) is:

      u(1)=1, d(1)=1.

      For n>=2:

        u(n) = 1 (for the single element) + 
                sum_{k=1}^{n-1} d(k)   ???  -> but that does not work.

  Let's derive the recurrence for u(n) and d(n) without the single element? 

  Alternatively, let:

      u(n) = number of alternating compositions of n that start with an increase (including the single element) 
      d(n) = number of alternating compositions of n that start with a decrease (including the single element) 

      Then the single element is in both.

      Now, consider a composition counted in u(n) (that is not the single element). It has at least two parts: the first part is i, then the next part is j>i, and the remainder is a composition of n-i-j that starts with j and is in d? but wait, the composition after the first part is not just the remainder? 

      Actually, the composition after the first part i is an alternating composition of n-i that starts with a decrease? but note: the first element of this composition must be j and we require i<j.

      However, the composition of n-i that starts with a decrease might start with any j>=1? but we require j>i.

      Therefore, we can write:

        u(n) = 1 + sum_{i=1}^{n-1} [ number of alternating compositions of n-i that start with a decrease and have first element j>i ]

      Similarly:

        d(n) = 1 + sum_{i=1}^{n-1} [ number of alternating compositions of n-i that start with an increase and have first element j<i ]

  But note: the composition of the tail is an alternating composition of n-i, but we care about the first element of that composition? and we require a condition on i and j.

  Let d'(m, i) = number of alternating compositions of m that start with a decrease and have first element > i.

  But we don't want to keep i as a state for each n? 

  Alternatively, we can use generating functions in a different way.

  Let U(x) = sum_{n} u(n) x^n, D(x)=sum_{n} d(n) x^n.

  Then the recurrence:

      u(n) = 1 + sum_{k=1}^{n-1} [ d(n-k) for the compositions of n-k in d that start with a value > k? ] 
             but not exactly: because the compositions in d(n-k) are defined for n-k, but we require that the first element of that composition is > k.

  How to count: the compositions in d(m) that have first element > k? 

      Let d_{>k}(m) = number of compositions in d(m) with first element > k.

  Then:

      u(n) = 1 + sum_{k=1}^{n-1} d_{>k}(n-k)

      similarly, 
      d(n) = 1 + sum_{k=1}^{n-1} u_{<k}(n-k)   [compositions in u(m) for m=n-k and first element < k]

  But note: we can also express:

      d_{>k}(m) = d(m) - d_{<=k}(m)

      and d_{<=k}(m) = sum_{j=1}^{min(m,k)} d_j(m)

  How to compute d_j(m)? 
      d_j(m) = number of compositions in d(m) that start with j.

      Then for a composition in d(m) starting with j:
          d_j(m) = 1_{j=m} (for the single element) + 
                    sum_{i=1}^{j-1} u_i(m-j)   [because after the first part j, we need a composition in u for the remainder m-j that starts with i<j]

      So d_j(m) = [ if j==m then 1 else 0 ] + sum_{i=1}^{j-1} u_i(m-j)

  Then d_{>k}(m) = d(m) - sum_{j=1}^{min(m,k)} d_j(m)

  Similarly, u_{<k}(m) = sum_{j=1}^{min(m,k-1)} u_j(m)

  And u_j(m) = [ if j==m then 1 else 0 ] + sum_{i=j+1}^{m} d_i(m-j)   [because after the first part j, we need a composition in d for the remainder m-j that starts with i>j]

  This seems very complex for n up to 300000.

Another approach from the literature:

  In fact, the number of alternating compositions is given by the recurrence:

      a(0)=1, a(1)=1
      a(n) = ( F(n+2) - 2 ) / 2  ? -> not matching.

  Or known result: 

      generating function: 

        U(x) = x + U(x)* (x^2/(1-x)) + U(x)*D(x) ? 

  We can also note the following: 

      Let's define without including the single element twice:

        Let U(n) = number of alternating compositions of n that start with an increase and have at least two parts.
        Let D(n) = number of alternating compositions of n that start with a decrease and have at least two parts.
        Let S(n) = 1 (for the single element)

        Then f(n) = U(n) + D(n) + S(n)

        Now, for U(n): 
            The composition: first part i, then a second part j>i, and then the rest is an alternating composition of n-i-j that starts with a decrease? and has at least one part? or can be empty? 

            But note: after the second part, we must have at least one more part to have the decrease? or not? the composition can be just two parts: [i, j] with j>i, which is valid for U(n) (but then the composition has only two parts) -> valid.

            So the composition after the first part i is a nonempty composition that is in D (starting with a decrease) for the amount n-i? and the first element of that composition must be j>i.

            But wait, the composition after the first part i is exactly the entire composition of n-i that starts with j>i and is in the set counted by D(n-i) union the single element [j] for j>i? 

            However, the single element [j] is not in D(n-i) (because D(n-i) requires at least two parts) -> it is in S(n-i).

            So the composition after the first part i can be any composition in the set D(n-i) ∪ S(n-i) provided it starts with j>i.

            Let T(n-i) = D(n-i) + S(n-i) = f(n-i) - U(n-i)   [because f(n-i) = U(n-i)+D(n-i)+S(n-i), then D(n-i)+S(n-i) = f(n-i)-U(n-i)] -> not helpful.

            Alternatively, let V(n) = D(n) + S(n) = number of alternating compositions of n that start with a decrease (including single element).

            Similarly, let W(n) = U(n) + S(n) = number of alternating compositions of n that start with an increase (including single element).

            Then for U(n) (compositions with at least two parts and start with an increase): 
                U(n) = sum_{i=1}^{n} [ the first part is i ] * [ then the composition of the remaining n-i is in V and starts with j>i ]

            But V is defined as compositions that start with a decrease including single element, and the condition is j>i.

            How to count for a fixed i and then the tail of n-i being in V and starting with j>i? 
                = sum_{i=1}^{n-1} [ number of compositions in V(n-i) that start with a value > i ]

            Similarly, 
                D(n) = sum_{i=1}^{n-1} [ number of compositions in W(n-i) that start with a value < i ]

            And note: 
                f(n) = U(n) + D(n) + 1   (because the single element is counted in neither U nor D)

            But also: 
                W(n) = U(n) + 1   (because the single element is in W) 
                V(n) = D(n) + 1 

            So we have:

                U(n) = sum_{i=1}^{n-1} [ number of compositions in V(n-i) with first element > i ]
                       = sum_{i=1}^{n-1} [ number of compositions in (D(n-i)+1) with first element > i ]   -> but wait, V(n-i)=D(n-i)+1, but the +1 is the single element. The single element of n-i is a composition of n-i that is just [n-i]. So it has first element = n-i. So it is > i if and only if n-i > i.

            Therefore:

                U(n) = sum_{i=1}^{n-1} [ 
                          (number of compositions in D(n-i) with first element > i) 
                          + (1 if n-i > i then 1 else 0)
                       ]

            Similarly, 
                D(n) = sum_{i=1}^{n-1} [ 
                          (number of compositions in W(n-i) with first element < i) 
                          + (1 if the single element [n-i] has n-i < i? -> if n-i < i then the single element is counted)
                       ]

            And note: the compositions in D(n-i) are compositions of n-i that start with a decrease (and have at least two parts) -> they have first element j, and then the composition continues.

            We need to count for each n-i and for each i, the number of compositions in D(n-i) that have first element > i, and compositions in W(n-i) that have first element < i.

            Let we precompute for each m: 
                in V(m) (which is = D(m)+1), we want to know: for each i, whether the single element is counted (if m>i) and then the compositions in D(m) with first element > i.

            But note: the compositions in D(m) are built from compositions in W(m-j) for j in [1, m-1] and then first element = j, and we require j>i for the first element of the composition in V(m) to be > i? 

            Actually, the first element of a composition in V(m) is the first part of that composition. For the single element in V(m), the first element is m. For a composition in D(m), the first element is the first part of the composition, which we call j.

            Therefore, the condition "first element > i" is simply that the first part j > i.

            So: 
                for V(m) (which is the set of compositions that start with a decrease including single element) the number of compositions with first element > i is:
                   [1 if m>i]   (for the single element) 
                   + (number of compositions in D(m) with first element > i)

            But how to compute the number of compositions in D(m) with first element > i? 
                D(m) = sum_{j=1}^{m-1} [ compositions in W(m-j) with first element < j ] 
                and the first element of the composition in D(m) is j.

                So the compositions in D(m) with first element > i are those with j>i, and then compositions in W(m-j) with first element < j (which is automatic in the summation) -> 
                   = sum_{j=i+1}^{m-1} [ the number of compositions in W(m-j) ]   [because the condition first element < j is then handled by the summation in the definition of D(m) only including j for which there is at least one composition in W(m-j) with first element < j? ]

            But wait, the summation in D(m) is over j, and for each j, we count all compositions in W(m-j) that have first element < j. 

            Therefore, the number of compositions in D(m) with first element = j is exactly the number of compositions in W(m-j) with first element < j.

            So the number of compositions in D(m) with first element > i is: 
                   = sum_{j=i+1}^{m-1} [ number of compositions in W(m-j) with first element < j ]

            But note: we don't have information about the first element of the composition in W(m-j) beyond what is used in the condition. 

            Alternatively, we can define arrays for the entire generating functions and then use convolution.

  Given the complexity and constraints (n up to 300000), we need an efficient recurrence.

  Known solution from other problems: 
      "Alternating permutations" might give insight, but compositions are easier than permutations.

  In fact, there is a generating function: 
      Let F(x) = sum_{n>=1} f(n) x^n.
      Then it is known that: 
          F(x) = (1 - x) / (1 - 2*x) + something -> no.

  A more known result: the number of alternating compositions is given by:

      f(n) = (2 * f(n-1) + [n>=2]? ) 

  Let's check:

      n=1: f(1)=1
      n=2: f(2)=1
      n=3: f(3)=3
      n=4:4
      n=5:7

      f(n) = 2*f(n-1) for n>=2? 
         f(2)=2*f(1)=2 -> not 1.

  Another recurrence: 
        f(n) = 2*f(n-1) + f(n-2) - 2*f(n-3) - f(n-4) ? 

  We can use the sample: 
        f(1)=1, f(2)=1, f(3)=3, f(4)=4, f(5)=7, f(6)=12, f(7)=19.
        f(6)=2*f(5)+f(4)-2*f(3)-f(2)=2*7+4-2*3-1=14+4-6-1=11 -> not 12.

  Alternatively, we can use the recurrence from the generating function that might be:

      F(x) = (x + (x for the single element) ) / (1 - ...) 

  But in a paper: "Alternating compositions" by Arnold Knopfmacher and Neville Robbins, we have:

      The generating function for alternating compositions is: 
          A(x) = (1 - x) / (1 - 2*x)  ? -> then 
          A(x) = (1-x)/(1-2x) = sum_{n} (2^{n-1} - 2^{n-2}? ) -> 
          for n>=1: a(n) = 2^{n-1} - 2^{n-2} = 2^{n-2} for n>=2, and for n=1: (1-x)/(1-2x) = (1-x)(1+2x+4x^2+...) = 1 + (2-1)x + (4-2)x^2 + ... = 1 + x + 2x^2+2x^3+4x^4+4x^5? 
          which does not match.

  Another known result: the number of alternating compositions of n is floor( (3*2^{n-1}+2)/7 ) for n>=1? -> 
      n=1: (3*1+2)/7 = 5/7 -> floor=0 -> not 1.

  After research, we found that the following recurrence holds for the sample:

      f(1)=1, f(2)=1, f(3)=3, f(4)=4, f(5)=7, f(6)=12, f(7)=19.
      f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) + f(n-3) ? 
          f(4)=f(3)+f(2)+f(1)=3+1+1=5 -> not 4.

      f(n) = f(n-1) + 2*f(n-2) - f(n-3) - f(n-4) ? 
          f(5)= f(4)+2*f(3)-f(2)-f(1)=4+2*3-1-1=4+6-2=8 -> not 7.

      f(n)= f(n-1) + f(n-2) - 
          f(3)= f(2)+f(1)=1+1=2 -> not 3.

      f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) + 1 for n>=3, 
          f(3)=1+1+1=3, 
          f(4)=3+1+1=5 -> not 4.

  Let's try: 
      f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) + [n even] ? 
          f(3)=f(2)+f(1)+0=1+1=2 -> not 3.

  f(n) = 2*f(n-2) + f(n-3) + f(n-1) - 
      for n=4: 2*f(2)+f(1)+f(3)=2*1+1+3=6 -> not 4.

  f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) for n>=5, then 
      f(5)=f(4)+f(3)=4+3=7, 
      f(6)=7+4=11 -> not 12.

  f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) + f(n-4)
      f(6)= f(5)+f(4)+f(2)=7+4+1=12, 
      f(7)=12+7+3=22 -> not 19.

  f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) + 1 for n>=4, 
      f(4)=f(3)+f(2)+1=3+1+1=5 -> not 4.

  f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) - f(n-4)
      f(5)= f(4)+f(3)-f(1)=4+3-1=6 -> not 7.

  f(n) = 2*f(n-1) - f(n-2) + f(n-3) - f(n-4)
      f(5)=2*4 -3 +1 -1=8-3+1-1=5 -> not 7.

  f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) + f(n-3) - f(n-4)
      f(5)= f(4)+f(3)+f(2)-f(1)=4+3+1-1=7, 
      f(6)=7+4+3-1=13 -> not 12.

  f(n) = f(n-1) + 2*f(n-2) - f(n-3) - f(n-4)
      f(5)=4+2*3-1-1=4+6-2=8 -> not 7.

  f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) + f(n-3) - f(n-4) - f(n-5)
      f(5)= use for n=5: need f(0) to f(4): 
             f(0) is not defined.

  After more samples, we see:

      n: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7
      f(n):1,1,3,4,7,12,19

      also, f(0) = 1 (empty composition) might be considered, but our composition must be nonempty.

      Observe: 
          7 = 4 + 3 
          12 = 7 + 4 + 1?
          19 = 12 + 7 
      -> not obvious.

  Alternatively, we can use the following recurrence that is known for the number of alternating compositions:

      f(n) = 0 if n<0, f(0)=0 (since compositions are nonempty) 
      f(1)=1
      For n>=2:
          f(n) = 1 + sum_{k=1}^{n-1} [ f(k) - ( if k>=2 then 1 else 0 ) ]   -> no.

  We also found in oeis.org: 
      search: 1,1,3,4,7,12,19 -> gives A079500: Number of compositions of the integer n in which the first part is >= the other parts.
      -> not matching.
