We can easily compute the number of tasks that Ayu is going to solve in the contest time. Let $S$ be this number. Therefore, now Ayu’s goal is to make sure that Budi did not solve the $S^{th}$ problem.

Observe that Ayu can always pop a balloon just before Budi about to solve a task, since if Budi is going to solve the next task in $k$ minutes, it is always not worse to let Budi waste the full $k$ minutes. Therefore, Ayu can decide whether she wants to pop a balloon only every time Budi just about to solve a task.

Suppose Budi is just about to solve a task (let’s say the $x^{th}$ task), how does Ayu determine whether she should pop a balloon? First, if Ayu currently does not have a balloon, then there is no choice but to let Budi solve the task. Otherwise, consider the tasks between task $x$ and task $S$, inclusive. If task $x$ takes the longest to solve for Budi, then Ayu should spend as many balloons as she can on this task. This means Budi will waste as many minutes as Ayu can. If there is a later task (let’s say the $y^{th}$ task) that Budi needs more time to solve, then it is better for Ayu to save her balloon and use it for the $y^{th}$ task instead. This ensures that Budi wastes more time.
