For an arbitrary garden configuration of red and blue flowers, there can be many possible good paths. To be able to count the number of good garden configurations, we first build a bijection between a garden configuration and a unique good path.

We define the _canonical path_ as a good path where we always prioritize going down, then going right. In the first example given in the statement, The green and orange paths are good paths, but both are not canonical. The canonical path is the path that goes in the following direction sequentially: down, right, down, down, right, down, down, right, right, right.

If you observe canonical paths of several grids, you can observe several properties:

- whenever a canonical path goes right followed by going down, there must be a red flower on this corner. Otherwise, if there is no red flower, then the canonical path will still go down instead of going right for this particular step.
- aside from the constraint above, all flowers on the bottom-left split must be red flowers, and all flowers on the top-right split must be blue flowers.

Since we have a unique canonical path for every good configuration, we can now try to count the number of good configurations by counting canonical paths. We use DP to count this: let $f(i, j, k)$ be the number of gardens with $i$ rows and $j$ columns, and the last movement in the canonical path is $k \in \{\text{RIGHT}, \text{DOWN}\}$.

The transition for the DP is to extend the canonical path DOWN (we multiply by $2^j$ or $2^{j - 1}$, since there are $j$ new cells on the bottom-left split, and depending on $k$ the rightmost cell must be a red flower or can be an empty cell) or RIGHT (the transition is similar). This yields $\mathcal{O}(1)$ transition, thus a $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ dynamic programming solution.

There is also an explicit formula that you can compute in $\mathcal{O}(N)$ which is left as an exercise to the reader.
