First of all, we can ignore the original sequence $A$ and just get the relation between every 2 consecutive numbers in $A$. At first glance, it looks like it can be done with a greedy approach from left to right; but if the sequence is almost all decreasing or most of them are decreasing, we have to make an adjustment to the elements prior to the current element when making $B$. It can be seen that the worst case is for every position, we will be updating all numbers below the current position, results in $O(n^2)$. We need something faster.

It can be seen that for every position, the numbers that have solutions formed a range. We define 2 functions, $low$ and $high$, that receives $i$ as an input and returns the lowest and highest number that have a solution for position $i$, respectively; So for every position $i$ ($1 \le i \le N$), every number $x$ in which $low_i \le x \le high_i$, we can find a solution that contains $x$ as a number in position $i$ of the new sequence $B$.

Note: If two consecutive elements have equal value, the values of 2 functions in corresponding indices will be equal too. So for simplicity, we ignore the consecutive elements that have equal value and only consider the rest.

We can generate the values of $low$ and $high$ as the following:

$$
(low_i, high_i) =
\begin{cases}
(L, R), & i = N \\\\
(\max((low_{i+1} - K, L), high_{i+1} - 1), & 1 \le i < N, A_i < A_{i+1} \\\\
((low_{i+1} + 1, \min(high_{i+1} + K, R)), & 1 \le i < N, A_i > A_{i+1}
\end{cases}
$$

If there exists some position $i$ that $low_i > R$ or $high_i < L$, there is no solution. Otherwise, there exists a solution for given constraints and configuration. As we want the lexicographically smallest sequence, we generate $B$ from the smallest position.

The element that fills the first position (position 1) will be $low_1$ itself, as it is the lowest possible number that has a solution. In every following position, we can simulate the similar algorithm with the $low$ and $high$ function above, but this time only considers the previous number that just been generated, and the $low$ and $high$ functions that have been generated before. So if $A_{i-1} < A_i$, $B_i$ must be somewhere inside $[B_{i-1}+1, B_{i-1} + K]$, and vice versa. But $B_i$ must also somewhere inside $[low_i, high_i]$, so we just check the lowest number that falls into both range, and it gives the value of $B_i$. It is guaranteed that there exists a number that falls into both ranges at the same time, as we already checked there is a solution first.

This solution runs in linear time, hence $O(N)$, enough to pass within the time limit.
