For each land, we can always build the two buildings on the same land by dividing this land into half horizontally or vertically. So, the answer should be at least half of the largest area of all buildings.

Since the two buildings donâ€™t necessarily have the same orientation if they are on the different lands, then we can assume that we can always swap $L_i$ and $W_i$ for any $i^{\text{th}}$ land. If we place the two building on $i^{\text{th}}$ and $j^{\text{th}}$ land, then the largest building area that we can build is 
$\max(\min(L_i, L_j) \times \min(W_i, W_j), \min(L_i, W_j) \times \min(W_i, L_j))$.

Without loss of generality, we assume that $\min(L_i, W_i, L_j, W_j) = L_i$, then the largest building area that we can build on $i^{\text{th}}$ and $j^{\text{th}}$ land is 
$\max(L_i \times \min(W_i, W_j), L_i \times \min(W_i, \max(W_j, L_j)))$.

To make the solution easier, we can swap $L_i$ and $W_i$ for some lands so that $L_i \leq W_i$ for all buildings.

Let us sort the lands based on the non-increasing $L_i$. Observe that for every $i > j$ we have $L_i \leq L_j$, and then the largest building area that we can build is 
$L_i \times \min(W_i, \max(W_j, L_j)) = L_i \times \min(W_i, W_j)$, since $L_j \leq W_j$. 
So, for any $i$, we just need to find the largest $W_j$ for all $j < i$. We can do all of them in 
$\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$ time-complexity.

**Note**: we must avoid using floating-point numbers since the answer can be very large until $10^{18}$ and it might cause the precision loss.
