Let’s say a row or a column is *colorful* if the values within it are all distinct. Otherwise, we say it’s *non-colorful*. Our objective in this problem is to minimize the number of modifications needed to make all rows and columns non-colorful.

Let $m_r$ denote the number of colorful rows, and $m_c$ denote the number of colorful columns. Since the number of colorful rows and colorful columns decreases by at most one with each modification, we require a minimum of $\max(m_r, m_c)$ modifications to make all rows and columns in the matrix non-colorful. We can show that $\max(m_r, m_c)$ is indeed adequate for achieving this objective as follows.

When both $m_r > 0$ and $m_c > 0$ hold, there exists an entry $(i, j)$ such that row $i$ and column $j$ are colorful. By changing the value at $(i, j)$ to an arbitrary integer other than $A_{ij}$, we simultaneously decrease the number of colorful rows and columns by one, respectively.

When $m_r = 0$ and $m_c > 0$, there exists a colorful column, let’s say column $j$. In this case, there must be at least one value $v$ such that modifying an entry $(1, j)$ to $v$ makes column $j$ non-colorful while keeping row $1$ non-colorful.

A similar logic applies when $m_r > 0$ and $m_c = 0$.

Using this approach, we can accomplish the objective with $\max(m_r, m_c)$ modifications. The computational time is $O(n^3)$ with a sloppy implementation. This can be further improved to $O(n^2)$ time.
