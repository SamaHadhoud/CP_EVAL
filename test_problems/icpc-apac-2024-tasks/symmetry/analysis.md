Let’s denote an input point $(x_i, y_i)$ by $P_i$. Also, let $X$ represent the center of the point symmetry. According to the definition of point symmetry, a point $Q_i$ satisfying $(P_i + Q_i)/2 = X \Rightarrow Q_i = 2X - P_i$ should also be included in the boundary of the convex region we are seeking. The problem is to find a point $X$ such that the $2n$ points $P_1, \dots, P_n, Q_1, \dots, Q_n$ form a hull, meaning that the boundary of the convex hull of the $2n$ points contains all of them. We say that a point $X$ satisfying this condition is _valid_.

Somewhat briefly, the solution is as follows: for two indices $a$ and $b$ that are between 1 and $n$, inclusive, let $L(a,b)$ be a line passing through $(P_a + P_b)/2$ and $(P_{a+1} + P_b)/2$. Here, we say $P_{n+1} = P_1$. Draw $n^2$ lines of $L(a,b)$ on the plane for $1 \le a, b \le n$. There are $O(n^4)$ intersection points between the lines. For each intersection point, verify whether the point is valid or not. If it is valid, calculate the area of the hull. This process requires $O(n \log n)$ time for each intersection point. The minimum area found by this procedure represents the solution. The runtime complexity is $O(n^5 \log n)$.

But why is the above solution correct? Before delving into the rationale, let’s explain a few concepts.

- The point $Q_i$ depends on the point $X$, so from now on, we write $Q_i$ as $Q_i(X)$.
- For three points $A, B$ and $C$, let $CCW(A, B, C)$ be true if and only if $(B - A) \times (C - A) \ge 0$.
- For a valid point $X$, let $s(X)$ denote the area of a convex hull formed by the points $P_1, \dots, P_n, Q_1(X), \dots, Q_n(X)$.

When we draw $n^2$ lines, the plane is divided into $O(n^4)$ connected regions. Let’s select one region $R$. Here, $R$ includes the boundary of the region. We denote the interior points of $R$ by $R^\circ$. For any two points $X \in R^\circ$ and $X' \in R$, and for any two indices $a$ and $b$, both of the following hold.

- If $CCW(P_a, P_{a+1}, Q_b(X))$ is true, $CCW(P_a, P_{a+1}, Q_b(X'))$ is also true.  
  _(Hint: prove that $CCW(P_a, P_{a+1}, Q_b(X))$ is equivalent to $CCW((P_a + P_b)/2, (P_{a+1} + P_b)/2, X)$.)_

- If $CCW(P_a, Q_b(X), Q_{b+1}(X))$ is true, $CCW(P_a, Q_b(X'), Q_{b+1}(X'))$ is also true.

This implies that if one point in $R^\circ$ is valid, then any point in $R$ is valid. Also, the order of vertices on the boundary of a convex polygon formed by $P_1, \dots, P_n, Q_1(X), \dots, Q_n(X)$ is always the same for $X \in R$.

From this, we can deduce that the function $s : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ is a linear function when the domain is restricted in $R$, because the area of a polygon is the sum of the cross product of neighboring vertices,

- $P_a \times P_{a+1}$ is constant,
- $P_a \times Q_b(X)$ and $Q_b(X) \times P_a$ vary linearly with respect to $X$, and
- $Q_b(X) \times Q_{b+1}(X) = (2X - P_b) \times (2X - P_{b+1}) = 2X \times (P_b - P_{b+1}) + P_b \times P_{b+1}$ **varies linearly with respect to $X$**.

Therefore, the minimum value of $s$ within the domain of $R$ is always achieved on the boundary of $R$. Specifically, since $R$ is a convex polygon, the minimum value is attained at the vertices of the region. This justifies the fact that we only need to check the intersection points of $n^2$ lines.
