As a preprocessing step, let us replace each input integer $a_i$ with $2a_i + 1$. This alteration does not affect the result; however, it proves to be useful for subsequent calculations.

A $d$-bit integer can be represented by a row vector in $(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^d$. For an input $a_i$, let us denote the corresponding row vector in $(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^d$ by $\vec{a}_i$. The XOR operation $a_i \oplus a_j$ corresponds to the addition $\vec{a}_i + \vec{a}_j$ in $(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^d$.

Similarly, the sequence $B$ can be represented as $n$ row vectors in $(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^d$. Now, the operation for indices  
$i$ and $j$ ($b_i \leftarrow b_i \oplus a_i \oplus a_j$ and $b_j \leftarrow b_j \oplus a_i \oplus a_j$) can be considered as an addition of $(\vec{0} \ldots, \vec{0}, \vec{a}_i + \vec{a}_j^{\ i}, \vec{0}, \ldots, \vec{0})$ to $B$. Let us denote this row vector by $\vec{v}_{i,j}$. Note that the dimension of $\vec{v}_{i,j}$ is $nd$.  
There are $\binom{n}{2}$ choices for $i$ and $j$. The solution to this problem is the number of elements in the space spanned by the vectors $\vec{v}_{i,j}$. Let $M$ be a $\binom{n}{2} \times (nd)$ matrix such that each row corresponds to a vector $\vec{v}_{i,j}$.  
The solution is equal to $2^{\text{rank}(M)}$. Thus, in summary, we only need to determine the rank of $M$.

To investigate the rank of $M$, for $k \ge 2$, let

$$
D_k = \begin{bmatrix}
\vec{a}_1 + \vec{a}_k \\
\quad\vec{a}_2 + \vec{a}_k \\
\quad\quad\ddots \\
\quad\quad\quad\vec{a}_{k-1} + \vec{a}_k
\end{bmatrix},
\quad
F_k = \begin{bmatrix}
\vec{a}_1 + \vec{a}_k \\
\vec{a}_2 + \vec{a}_k \\
\vdots \\
\vec{a}_{k-1} + \vec{a}_k
\end{bmatrix},
$$


and $R_k$ be an $(k-1) \times (nd)$ matrix $[D_k \mid F_k \mid O]$. Also, let $M_k$ be a matrix formed by stacking matrices $R_2, R_3, \ldots, R_k$ vertically. The matrix $M$ as described above is equivalent to $M_n$. Without loss of generality, we can assume that $s$ row vectors $\vec{a}_1, \ldots, \vec{a}_s$ are linearly independent, and other vectors can be expressed as the sum of a subset of $\vec{a}_1, \ldots, \vec{a}_s$.

### Observation L.1.
$\text{rank}(M_s) = \binom{s}{2}$.

**Proof.** Suppose that $\sum_{(i,j) \in C} \vec{v}_{i,j} = 0$ for some set of indices $C \subseteq \{(i,j) \mid 1 \le i < j \le s\}$. Let us examine the first $d$ elements of the vector $\sum_{(i,j) \in C} \vec{v}_{i,j}$. In particular, $\sum_{(1,j) \in C} (\vec{a}_1 + \vec{a}_j) = \vec{0}$ must hold. Because $\vec{a}_1, \ldots, \vec{a}_s$ are linearly independent, $C$ cannot contain any element of the form $(1,j)$ for $j = 2, \ldots, s$. With the same arguments applied to other elements, we can deduce that $C$ must be empty. This means that the row vectors in $M_s$ are linearly independent, and therefore $\text{rank}(M_s) = \binom{s}{2}$.

### Observation L.2.
For $k > s$, $\text{rank}(M_k) = \text{rank}(M_{k-1}) + s - 1$.

From Observations L.1 and L.2, we can conclude that the rank of $M$ is $\binom{s}{2} + (n - s)(s - 1)$. Since the computation of $s$, the number of linearly independent vectors, can be performed in $O(nd)$ time, the runtime is $O(nd)$. (In this problem, $d = 31$.) The remaining part is the outline of the proof for Observation L.2.

**Proof.** First, we can show that the rank of $F_k$ is $s - 1$. Because the rows of $F_k$ are linear combinations of $\vec{a}_1, \ldots, \vec{a}_s$, $\text{rank}(F_k) \le s$. The rank can be further bounded by $s - 1$ because any combination of rows in $F_k$ always contains an even number of $\vec{a}_1, \ldots, \vec{a}_s$. (Here, we utilized the result of the preprocessing, that $\vec{a}_{s+1}, \ldots, \vec{a}_k$ are represented by an **odd** number of sums of the basis $\vec{a}_1, \ldots, \vec{a}_s$.) Also, without loss of generality, we can assume that $\vec{a}_k = \vec{a}_1 + \cdots + \vec{a}_t$, where $t \ge 1$ is an odd integer. Then, the $s - 1$ vectors $\vec{a}_2 + \vec{a}_k, \vec{a}_3 + \vec{a}_k, \ldots, \vec{a}_s + \vec{a}_k$ are linearly independent. From this, we can conclude that $\text{rank}(F_k) = s - 1$.

Next, since the matrix $M_k$ has the form

$$
M_k = \begin{bmatrix}
M_{k-1} & O \\
D_k & F_k
\end{bmatrix},
$$

we can say that $\text{rank}(M_k) \ge \text{rank}(M_{k-1}) + s - 1$. To show that the inequality “$\ge$” is actually an equality, we need to establish that the elements of $D_k$ do not affect the rank of $M_k$. Suppose that there exists a subset $C \subseteq \{1, \ldots, k - 1\}$ such that $\sum_{i \in C} (\vec{a}_i + \vec{a}_k) = \vec{0}$. That is, $C$ represents the indices of rows in $F_k$ whose sum equals $\vec{0}$. For our purposes, it suffices to show that there always exists a subset $C' \subseteq \{(i,j) \mid 1 \le i < j < k\}$ such that $\sum_{i \in C} \vec{v}_{i,k} = \sum_{(i,j) \in C'} \vec{v}_{i,j}$.

When $|C|$ is odd, because $\vec{a}_k = \sum_{i \in C} \vec{a}_i$, $C' = \{(i,j) \mid i, j \in C, i < j\}$ satisfies the condition. Meanwhile, when $|C|$ is even, because $\sum_{i \in C} \vec{a}_i = \vec{0}$, a set $C'$ constructed from $\{1, \ldots, t\} \times C$ satisfies the condition. This concludes the statement of the observation.
