The integers in $L$ can be represented as tuples $(x, \text{LCA}(x, y), y)$, where the tuples are ordered by $x$, ties are broken by $\text{LCA}(x, y)$, and further ties are broken by $y$. Since each $i$ has $n$ tuples with $i$ as its first element, the value of $x$ for the $k$-th element of $L$ is simply $\left\lceil \frac{k}{n} \right\rceil$. Next, we want to find the $((k - 1) \mod n + 1)$-th tuple with $x$ as its first element. For simplicity, let $m = (k - 1) \mod n + 1$.

Let $S(i)$ be the set of nodes in the subtree of node $i$, and $A = \{a_1, a_2, \dots\}$ be the ancestors of node $x$ in order from $x$ (i.e., $a_1 = x$ and node $a_{i+1}$ is the parent of node $a_i$). Let $f(a_i) = |S(a_i) \setminus S(a_{i-1})|$ (i.e., the number of nodes in the subtree of node $a_i$ but not in the subtree of node $a_{i-1}$), and $f(z) = 0$ for $z \notin A$. This means $f(z)$ is the number of tuples with $x$ and $z$ as the first and second elements respectively.

```
              a₃ = 2
                /  \
         a₂ = 4     3
           /    \    \        
x = a₁ = 1       5    8
        /  \
        6   7
```
- $f(a_1) = f(1) = 3$ (nodes 1, 6, and 7)
- $f(a_2) = f(4) = 2$ (nodes 4 and 5)
- $f(a_3) = f(2) = 3$ (nodes 2, 3, and 8)
- $f(3) = f(5) = f(6) = f(7) = 0$

The $m$-th tuple that we are looking for has $l$ as $\text{LCA}(x, y)$ where $\sum_{i=1}^{l} f(i) \ge m$ and $\sum_{i=1}^{l-1} f(i) < m$. We can find this value using a segment tree that stores the values of $f(i)$. For each edge $(u, v)$, by changing the value of $x$ from $u$ to $v$, only the values of $f(u)$ and $f(v)$ change. Therefore, we can keep the segment tree for each $x$ using persistent segment tree in $O(n \log n)$ preprocessing time.

Let $m' = m - \sum_{i=1}^{l-1} f(i)$. We want to find the $m'$-th tuple with $x$ and $l$ as its first and second elements respectively. Let $p$ be the index of $A$ such that $a_p = l$. Thus, we want to find the $m'$-th node (in increasing order) in $S(a_p) \setminus S(a_{p-1})$.

We can do this by using another segment tree. Let $G_i$ be a segment tree that stores $G_i(j) = 1$ if node $i$ is an ancestor of node $j$, or $G_i(j) = 0$ otherwise. To compute $G_i$, we can take $G_h$ as the base, where node $h$ is the child of node $i$ with maximum $|S(h)|$, and change the values of $G_i(j)$ for all nodes $j \in (S(i) \setminus S(j))$ individually. With another persistent segment tree, we can keep all segment trees $G$ in $O(n \log^2 n)$ preprocessing time.

With $G_{a_p}$ and $G_{a_{p-1}}$ which represents the subtree of node $a_p$ and node $a_{p-1}$ respectively, we can find the answer $y$ that we are looking for. It is the unique integer that satisfies the following two inequalities:

$$
\left( \sum_{i=1}^{y} G_{a_p}(i) \right) - \left( \sum_{i=1}^{y} G_{a_{p-1}}(i) \right) \ge m'
$$

$$
\left( \sum_{i=1}^{y-1} G_{a_p}(i) \right) - \left( \sum_{i=1}^{y-1} G_{a_{p-1}}(i) \right) < m'
$$

This solution runs in $O(n \log^2 n) + q \log^2(n))$ time for preprocessing the persistent segment trees and answering all questions.
