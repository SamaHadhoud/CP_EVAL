We have the following straightforward dynamic programming solution: let $f[\text{time}][\text{starttime}]$ be the maximum amount of money that can be obtained if we start from day $\text{starttime}$ (modulo $T$) and work for $\text{time}$ days.

However, in this case, it is beneficial to reverse the variables: let $g[\text{money}][\text{starttime}]$ be the minimum amount of time that is needed to get _at least_ $\text{money}$ million cat dollars.

Let $\text{money}$, $\text{part}$ and $\text{starttime}$ be arbitrary nonnegative integers such that $\text{part} < \text{money}$. Consider a sequence of valid construction jobs $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n$ that satisfies $g[\text{money}][\text{starttime}]$ (i.e. the total money received when completing the jobs is at least $\text{money}$ and the jobs take $g[\text{money}][\text{starttime}]$ time). Because each job has payment no more than $5$, there must be some $i$ such that the total payment of $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_i$ is in $\{\text{part}, \text{part}+1, \ldots, \text{part}+4\}$.

Therefore,  
$$
g[\text{money}][\text{starttime}] = \min_{j=0}^4 g[\text{part}+j][\text{starttime}] + g[\text{money}-\text{part}-j][\text{starttime}']
$$  
where $\text{starttime}'$ is computed accordingly based on the completion time of the first half.

This motivates us to precompute $g[\text{money}][\text{starttime}]$ where $\text{money} = 2^k + l$ for some $0 \le k \le b$ and $-4 \le l \le 4$ using $O(bT)$ time. Since it’s not possible to get more than $5 \times 10^{11}$ million cat dollars (i.e. 0.5 quintillion cat dollars), we can set $b = \lfloor \log_2 5 \times 10^{11} \rfloor \le 40$. To answer each query, we can use binary search (specifically the binary lifting variant) to compute the answer to each query in $O(b)$ by trying to set the bits of $\text{money}$ from high to low. Note that there is an additional factor of $O((\max p)^2)$ when precomputing $g[\text{money}][\text{starttime}]$ and answering the queries, where $\max p \le 5$.

**Remark:** It’s also possible to let $g[\text{money}][\text{starttime}]$ be the minimum amount of time needed to get _exactly_ $\text{money}$ million cat dollars (set it to $\infty$ if the exact amount of money is unreachable), but this complicates the binary search implementation.

**Challenge:** Can you remove the $\log$ factor from the solution?
