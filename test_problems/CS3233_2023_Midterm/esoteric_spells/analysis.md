We greedily assign the bits from high to low. Initially, we set all $x_i = 0$. Suppose we are currently considering bit $b$. If there are $0$ elements with bit $b$ on, then we can simply skip this. If there is $1$ element $a_i$, then we can turn bit $b$ of $x_i$ on. If there are $2$ or more elements, let any two of the elements be $a_i$ and $a_j$. We can turn bit $b$ of $x_i$ on, and turn all bits $\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, b - 1\}$ of $x_j$ on (since $2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^{b-1} < 2^b$, thus it is valid).
